A petition against the Safe Schools program with more than 17,000 signatures from the Australian Chinese community has been tabled in the New South Wales Parliament.The Liberal Member for Epping, Damien Tudehope, lodged the petition on Tuesday and said there were significant concerns about the program in migrant communities in north-western Sydney and throughout the city.Safe Schools is a federally funded anti-bullying program aimed at helping lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and/or intersex (LGBTI) school students and is administered by state and territory education departments.The program was subject of a Federal Government review earlier this year after several conservative MPs aired concerns that the material was not age appropriate and more parental consent was needed.The petition is calling on the program to be scrapped in NSW schools, saying it "promotes a particular ideology, including gender fluidity, that is contrary to our cultural and belief system".Mr Tudehope said he represented one of the most multicultural electorates in Sydney."One thing that our migrant communities have in common is that they won't allow anyone interfering with their parental rights, and programs like Safe Schools represent an attack on the rights of all parents," Mr Tudehope said in a statement."Definitely there is a need to talk to kids about bullying, but it is clear that Safe Schools is not the answer."A more inclusive program which respects Australia's cultural and religious diversity would deliver better outcomes for vulnerable students."The petition says the program "discriminates against children and parents from other cultures who have a view of sexual relationships involving male and female as normative".Earlier this year, Federal Education Minister Simon Birmingham asked Emeritus Professor Bill Louden to conduct the review, after the Coalition MPs voiced concerns.In March, the NSW Government described the subsequent Federal Government changes to Safe Schools as "sensible", despite concerns being raised elsewhere.The ABC contacted several peak Chinese community groups, including the Australian Chinese Community Association and the Chinese Australian Forum, along with several Chinese businesses and community leaders in Sydney's north west.The local organisations and community leaders confirmed the petition had been circulated, but declined to comment on it further.Kenrick Cheah, the president of the Chinese Australian Forum, said he had not heard about the petition until Tuesday."The Chinese community is anti-bullying, so I don't think 17,000 signatures is representative of their views on the entire subject to be honest with you," he said.A spokesman for NSW Education Minister Adrian Piccoli said the Minister would not be commenting until the petition reached the floor of the Parliament.He said every MP had the right to bring a petition to Parliament with over 10,000 signatures.The petition has been tabled in Parliament and will be debated on September 22.
