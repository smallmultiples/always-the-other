Chinese-born Australian artist Guo Jian has arrived in Australia after being deported from China where he was detained last month following his comments on the 25th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.Guo arrived in Sydney Airport just after 8:00am and was greeted by friends after disembarking from his Air China flight from Beijing.He told journalists he was tired but glad to be home."I'm really happy to be back here now," he said.Guo was born in China but lived in Australia for almost two decades before moving back to Beijing in 2005.The 52-year-old former Chinese soldier was detained after an interview with the Financial Times regarding his experiences as a protester during the army's violent dispersal of the demonstrators on June 4, 1989.His detention was seen as part of a wider effort by authorities to stifle criticism of the government and remembrance of those who died in connection with the events 25 years ago.Earlier, Melanie Wang, a friend of Guo, told reporters at Beijing airport that he had been put on an flight to Sydney."I'll be taking off immediately. Thank you, all of you," Guo said in a telephone call to Ms Wang, which she recorded and played to journalists at the airport.China's foreign ministry has said Guo had been detained on visa fraud charges. Before his detention, Guo had finished a piece of artwork showing Tiananmen Square covered in meat.Guo's girlfriend, Yang Fangfang, said that before his deportation, the artist had been able to return to his Beijing studio briefly to pack up some of his old paintings, but that his Tiananmen-related pieces had been destroyed.For the ruling Communist Party, the 1989 demonstrations that clogged Tiananmen Square in Beijing and spread to other cities remain taboo.The anniversary of the date on which troops shot their way into central Beijing has never been publicly marked in mainland China, though every year there are commemorations in Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.The government has never released a death toll for the crackdown, but estimates from human rights groups and witnesses range from the hundreds to the thousands.This year's anniversary was marked by the detention of at least 66 activists, according to rights group Amnesty International, increased security in Beijing, and tighter controls on the internet.
