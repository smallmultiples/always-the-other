Chinese-Australian artist Guo Jian has reportedly been detained by Chinese police amid a crackdown on attempts to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.The artist notified friends on Sunday that he was being taken from his home in Songzhuang, an art colony on the eastern fringe of Beijing, before they lost contact with him. Australia's embassy in Beijing is requesting more information about his reported detention.Guo had recently finished a piece of art work showing Tiananmen Square covered in meat.He was born in 1962 in Guizhou province, in south-western China, into a minority Buyei family.As a young, aspiring artist, Guo enlisted with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) at 17, hoping to study at one of the army's arts colleges.Instead, he was enlisted as a propaganda poster painter.Guo says his time in the military was transformative and left him cynical of the army and Communist Party.He left the army in 1982 and returned to his home town, where he worked as a propaganda officer at a transport company and as a long-haul driver. At the age of 23, Guo was accepted into the highly selective Minzu University of China in Beijing.He graduated in 1989 with a Bachelor of Arts in Chinese painting and literature.As a student, Guo took part in the popular protest movement of the time, including the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown.As a result, he was banned from being given a job. He moved to the outskirts of Beijing with a group of artists and began his professional painting career.In 1992, Guo immigrated to Australia, under pressure from authorities.He lived in Sydney, working during the day and painting at night.His artwork, inspired by political upheaval in China over the past five decades, gained the attention of curators and his reputation grew.Guo uses art to explore themes in Chinese and Western propaganda, from within and without.In 2005, Guo returned to China to live in an arts community at Songzhuang, east of Beijing.
