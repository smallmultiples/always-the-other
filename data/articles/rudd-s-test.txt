Rule number one for all oppositions is to indulge in megaphone politics because they are desperate to get noticed, especially during their first term in the parliamentary naughty corner.So it goes for Megaphone Malcolm and his Coalition cronies who shrill that Rudd has thrown to the wolves the Rio executive Stern Hu, who is now an involuntary guest of the Shanghai Bureau of State Security. They also claim his much-vaunted knowledge of and special relationship with China have proved illusory. That is fair enough as oppositions should press governments.But we all know Rudd was never starry-eyed about China. His honours thesis in 1980 was about the terrible travails of human rights activist Wei Jingsheng in the Democracy Wall protest movement of 1978. Rudd's sympathies were firmly with the light of Wei against an authoritarian state in a country that had never known the concept of individual rights because of the pre-eminence of the collective good.His views then are consistent now with his 2006 article expressing his admiration for Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the German pastor who stood by his Christian principles against the Nazis. They despised such humanitarian impudence and throttled it with a noose in 1945.Rudd clearly identifies with the concern of these two men with political principle and the sanctity of life. He makes sense of such things by combining Christianity with a social democratic sensibility for the good of others. For him, Christian principle is not something to be taken untarnished into the afterlife. They are to be exercised now in this life and government is the instrument for doing public good.Such beliefs are evident in his maiden speech of 1998 when he also turned his mind to the evils of neo-liberalism, the same theme that exercised his 2009 article on the evils of financial deregulation.In 1998 in the wake of the Asian financial crisis, he was warning of the future with a quotation from the Reserve Bank governor:"Given the bigger role for economic contagion, more and more people are asking whether the international financial system as it has operated for most of the 1990s is basically unstable. By now, I think the majority of observers have come to the conclusion that it is, and that sudden changes have to be made."So we can see a consistency in Rudd's beliefs and in his public discourse. I have no doubt that Rudd's sympathies are with Stern Hu just as they were with Wei and Bonhoeffer.However, the eternal question faced by Rudd is the same one that faced Thomas More, the politician cum Christian intellectual in the court of Henry VIII: how do you reconcile principle and politics?Rudd's version of this question is how to be firm with China and get Hu back while maintaining a relationship with China as well as sustaining a positive public image. Rudd doesn't wish to make statements that will entrench Beijing in his position but neither does he wish to back down.He must not appear to be a ruthless pragmatist, which is the possibility evident in the nickname Dr Death which he gleaned from his days in Queensland government. Public approval of Rudd is wide right now but affection is not deep. He needs to build that affection for the future rather than dissipate what little he has so early in the first term.It is the sort of political test that all prime ministers must undergo and Rudd has never really confronted it until now. His public image so far has not been sullied by appearances of horse-trading but has in fact been boosted by his responses to the global economic problems.His response will help to define the rest of his first term and his public image. Howard confronted it in his first term with the Hanson episode when many in his own party, let alone the left, demanded he repudiate Hanson's public statements.There are other ramifications for the future. The ALP and the Liberals have received substantial donations from Chinese and Chinese-Australian businessmen. This is no different to donations from English, American and other sources in the past. Indeed, there is the possibility that such contacts can be useful back channels in the current imbroglio.More worrying for the future is the probability that these men will be more pressured by Beijing, which takes the attitude that businessmen are auxiliaries to Chinese foreign policy in their overseas dealings, especially if they want to do business back home.During the Tibetan protests, Beijing took the attitude that overseas Chinese should be a loyal supporting arm to the homeland. The same attitude combined with a hardline that China is in the economic box seat could see unfair pressures placed on the Chinese diaspora in Australia.Both parties need to use their contacts to quietly work to relieve such pressures without kneeling to Beijing.
