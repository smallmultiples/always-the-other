Chinese-Australian artist Guo Jian has been fined and is being held in administrative detention over a visa irregularity in China, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAT) says.The 52-year-old artist was detained in Beijing earlier this week ahead of the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.DFAT says Australian consular officials have visited Guo in Beijing, and have been told he was detained on a visa-related matter."We understand Mr Guo will be detained for 15 days and then required to depart China," a DFAT spokesman said."The Australian Government will extend Mr Guo all appropriate consular assistance while detained."The department's consular head, Justin Brown, says embassy staff in Beijing have been in regular contact with Chinese authorities since the artist was detained on Sunday.Guo notified friends on Sunday that he was being taken by police from his home in Songzhuang, an art colony on the eastern fringe of Beijing, before they lost contact with him. Â  Security has been tight on the streets of Beijing for the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.Authorities deployed hundreds of police, many armed with rifles, to patrol the area ahead of the June 4 anniversary of the bloody repression of pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square.Guo had recently finished a piece of art work showing Tiananmen Square covered in meat.The government has never released a death toll from the violence on the night of June 3-4, 1989, but estimates from human rights groups and witnesses range from several hundred to several thousand.In China this week public discussion of these events remains prohibited. Newspapers, television and radio will simply ignore the anniversary, while social media sites are being strictly censored.
