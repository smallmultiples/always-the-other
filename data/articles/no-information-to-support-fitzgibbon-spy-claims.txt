Defence Department head Nick Warner says he has not seen any evidence to show that officers conducted a covert investigation into Defence Minister Joel Fitzgibbon.Newspaper reports today claimed officers within Mr Fitzgibbon's department were investigating his relationship with Chinese-Australian businesswoman Helen Liu after concerns the friendship posed a security risk.Defence Department Secretary Mr Warner says the allegations are "very serious" and has ordered a report into the claims to be given to him within a week.Mr Warner says he has seen nothing so far which validates the claims but he has asked for an interim report on the matter as soon as possible."I have seen no information to suggest there is substance to any of the allegations," he said."But as I said these are very serious allegations, they need to be thoroughly investigated and they are being thoroughly investigated."Mr Warner says he and Defence Force Chief Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston did not know of the allegations until they were published this morning.Asked by reporters if there were ever any circumstances under which a minister could be secretly investigated by their own department Mr Warner replied: "No"."Defence doesn't act without authority of Government on any matter," he said.Mr Fitzgibbon has suggested that people opposed to his reform agenda, to be detailed later this year in an upcoming white paper, may be behind today's reports."I am driving the biggest reform project in the history of the Defence organisation and I know that's really hard for some elements of that organisation," he said."But I'm doing so in close partnership with the Chief of the Defence Force and the secretary of my Department and together we are determined to continue our pursuit of those much needed reforms and we are determined to secure those reforms."But Mr Warner has moved to play down and suggestions tensions have boiled over between the Minister and the Department."The Chief of the Defence Force and I have very close and good working relationship with the Minister of Defence and with his office," he said."I would go so far as to say it is a closer working relationship than most [Defence chiefs] and secretaries have had with their ministers."Mr Fitzgibbon has defended his 15-year friendship with Ms Liu and Mr Warner says the Minister's personal relationships are a matter for him.But Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull wants Mr Fitzgibbon sacked."We need to have a Defence Minister in whom the Australian Defence Force has confidence in and whom the Australian public can have confidence and who can work effectively with his department," he said."Joel Fitzgibbon can do none of those things."
