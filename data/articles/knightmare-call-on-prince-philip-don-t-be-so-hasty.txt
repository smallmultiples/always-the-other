The seemingly bizarre knighthoods decision has been met with a little criticism from the graffitists on social media, but in some respects good old Prince Philip is a perfect choice, writes Dominic Knight.Yesterday, our Prime Minister pondered the relative merits of 22 million Australians, and decided that two men were worthy of our nation's top honour - a widely respected military leader, and that Greek-Danish fellow who is married to the Queen.In so doing, Tony Abbott ensured that the nation spent this year's Australia Day discussing the merits of a nonagenarian who lives on the other side of the planet, instead of the person we would all have been discussing otherwise, Taylor Swift. Still, at least Rosie Batty got one evening atop our news headlines.The decision has been met with a little criticism from the graffitists on social media, but in some respects, Prince Philip is a perfect choice. All of the other recipients since knighthoods and damehoods were reinstated have been vice-regal and/or members of the military. Philip is not only ex-military, but he's so downright regal that he lives in Buckingham Palace.Despite the ongoing gnashing of republican teeth, we are a constitutional monarchy, and the latest Knight of the Order of Australia is a key part of that, having ensured its continuity into the 21st century by fathering four children, a healthy 75 per cent of whom are not currently embroiled in an underage sex scandal.But despite the pomp, nothing could be more democratic than Mr Abbott's latest "captain's call", so-called because everything makes more sense with a cricket analogy, except when you recall that Australia's cricket captains don't in fact pick the team.Australians were given a choice whether to dispose of our royal family in 1999, and overwhelmingly voted to retain it. Not only that, but we recently elected the former national executive director of Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy as Prime Minister - and with a majority as whopping as any of Her Majesty's estates.Admittedly, Mr Abbott chose not to share his plans to reintroduce knighthoods and damehoods with voters during the campaign, presumably realising that it might have created some little distraction from his highly successful mantras about taxes and boats.But our system is that our government gets to do whatever it likes, subject only to the Senate and the courts, before the public gets to review its contract. And besides, if we had been asked whether there was any chance of a man whose favourite TV show is widely known to be Downton Abbey opting to reintroduce an ancient heraldic tradition, who among us would definitely have ruled it out?And even if we had, given recent governments' attitudes to election promises, what would have stopped him deciding to do it anyway?Prime Ministerships ultimately reflect their occupants. Bob Hawke smashed a beer while wearing the world's most garish jacket and suggested that everyone chuck a sickie the day after Australia II won. Whereas Mr Abbott gave the Duke of Edinburgh a knighthood. Different men, different priorities. But we knew what they were into when we elected them.Since we have chosen to be a constitutional monarchy with a monarchist leader, surely giving a knighthood to the Queen's husband is an utterly unremarkable thing to do? He's been our monarch's consort for 62 years - more than half of our existence as a nation. He is already a Companion of the Order of Australia, our previous top honour, and his son Charles is already a Knight of the Order of Australia. The Queen's rellos accumulate knighthoods the same way that Clive Palmer accumulates replica dinosaurs.If Mr Abbott had wanted to do something truly unexpected, he could have emulated some of the residents of the island of Tanna in Vanuatu, and announced that henceforth, we'd be worshipping Prince Philip as a god. But a constitutional monarchy giving a knighthood to a man who already has three is about as surprising as American Sniper playing to big houses in Texas.Despite the relatively small proportion of his 62 years beside our monarch which he's spent here, there's something deeply Australian about Prince Philip. Some have pointed to his history of what many have called gaffes and others might call especially robust examples of free speech in action.But what could be more Australian than the odd moment of awkwardness when it comes to race relations? The Prince/Duke/Knight might not have entirely figured out what to say when he meets Aborigines, but our nation still hasn't figured out how to deal with the day on which his knighthood was granted also being a day of mourning for many of Australia's original inhabitants. And controversial gaffes are as enduring a part of Australian public life as Fred Nile.When Tony Abbott reinstated knights and dames, he said that "this new award will go to those who have accepted public office rather than sought it". Well, surely nobody has sought their office less than someone who was born a prince.Dominic Knight is the NSW/ACT Evenings presenter on ABC Local Radio.

Comments for this story are closed.27 Jan 2015 8:53:24amI have no problem with a knighthood for the Prince. He's given decades of public service, and is still going at it. Had he fallen for Princess Margaret, he could have been kicking back enjoying retirement for the past 30 years or so.It's also a nice subliminal message to back up Joe Hockey's agenda of "no retirement".

27 Jan 2015 10:30:53amYeah I have seen those quotes.  All over a decade old and all could be in bad humor.  Speaking of racism, the readiness for someone to abuse Abbott because he was born in England or ignore the Australian head of state (the Monarch) is a bit ridiculous.  I would be happy if Australian parliament had to agree on its own GG or giving the decision to the opposition party.  However at present our national leader is not the PM (that position does not exist in the constitution), the leader is the crown who accepts the recommendation of the parliament for the  crowns representative known as the governor general.

Alert moderator
27 Jan 2015 4:41:52pmI have a problem with those who blindly or blatantly want to shoot down the Knighthood for the Prince Consort. Prince Philip has been patron of a number of Australian (and other Commonwealth) organisations with his association with various youth awards being best known. So there is a service link with Australia. He is also, much to the discomfort of republicans, the guff making husband of The Queen of the Commonwealth of which we are members.My challenge is for Bill Shorten and ABC reports who want to make this unusual but merited award into a national debate, to tell Prince Philip that on the change of government they will ask him to return the awarded knighthood.Blindness is even worse. There are quite a number of Australian Citizens who have received high awards from other countries because of their contribution to other societies.Those who criticise should go to spec savers in my view.

27 Jan 2015 6:03:10pmUnfortunately, when anything in Australia becomes something that Australians are proud off, the Royals place their moniker on it like parasites - for example, the Royal Surf Life Saving Assoc used to be the Australian Surf Life Saving Assoc, the Royal Flying Doctor used to be the Australian Flying Doctor, then there are all of the military medals which are British (and largely awarded to protestant descendants of the British, check the recipients of the VC if you want to know about racism).  The Britishness of Australia has been, is and will continue to be a divisive issue until Australia believes in itself and is proud of its achievements in their own right.

27 Jan 2015 6:22:50pmWhat I have a problem with is the fact that this has been a frivolous distraction, taking attention away from the Australian of the Year Award winner, Rosie Batty.Her well-deserved award for campaigning against domestic violence, following the grievous loss of her son who was murdered by her husband/father of her son, has been totally obscured by reportage of this latest ludicrous act of Tony Abbott's.Made even worse by the fact that it was Abbott who presented the award to Ms Batty - Tony Abbott, a person who has previously proclaimed "If we're honest, most of us would accept that a bad boss is a little bit like a bad father or a bad husband.  You find that he tends to do more good than harm."Most of us DON'T accept that Tony Abbott, in today's world.  It shows what a tough job Rosie Batty has ahead of her - especially when our country is led by a person still stuck in the fifties.

27 Jan 2015 9:15:42pmThere is a problem here Rob, not with Prince Philip but closer to home.The system we have for Orders of Australia requires formal nominations to the Australian Honours & Awards Secretariat, the nomination requires referees reports and goes before a nineteen (19) member committee headed by Angus Houston currently and comprising the Council for the Order of Australia who meet twice yearly. A nomination for an OA can take between 18 and 24 months and once approved by the Council within the various categories of OA, the recommendation goes forward to the Governor General for royal assent.That's the procedure for the Orders of Australia: with the Dames and Knights, Tony thinks of somebody and that's it ; it's a Captains' Pick.Personally, I'm fed up with Captains' Picks.li

I do like how conservatives don't consider facts or logic to be prerequisites of having a passionate opinion, it does make it almost impossible to have a meaningful debate with them, but it is funny.Personally I do think that the knighthood for Prince Phillip is fitting; an outdated award for an outdated casually bigoted dinosaur being granted by a prime minister of a similar ilk.

My gut feeling is that Abbott overstepped the mark and Shorten made a good play but we will need a little time to sort out the overall view of the country.My own is that it is well pass time for Australia to become a republic.
Alert moderator
27 Jan 2015 12:28:09pmHow many times do we need to waste millions of dollars holding referenda over this issue of becoming a republic, when in reality it won't change a single thing.The reason why another referendum is doomed to fail on this issue is that it will be hard for the republicans (not to be confused with the crazy US ones) to overcome the Australian voter apathy to implement a big change for no material benefit.Then there's the problem of framing the question...If the republicans aren't careful they'll end up with another scenario as 1999, where they pushed and pushed for a referendum and so they got one. Only the question was framed in such a way that the issue of becoming a republic was tied to the type of republic we should have. First, the republicans need to get into office so that they can control the drafting of the referendum question that we vote on, and then they need to not stuff it up!But really, does anyone actually care who's face is on our money?

27 Jan 2015 6:00:41pm"I do. One more referendum - not a waste of money. Looking for planes at the bottom of the ocean - somewhere - is a waste of money."However, looking for a plane that has crashed in the middle of the ocean is part of our international obligations, whereas holding another referendum about becoming a republic is a folly that achieves nothing.The Australian government has all the powers it needs to make laws and effectively govern and becoming a republic will not change that.  Further, Australia doesn't pay money back to the Monarchy, so becoming a republic won't change that either.The only thing becoming a republic will change is that the Queen will be replaced as our Head of State by someone local. However, we will have to change our currency, stamps, flag, our constitution, make amendments to all of our legislation... and for what? so we can feel good about finally ridding ourselves of a Monarchy that doesn't interfere in our lives one bit. Sounds like a good use of public money to me!

The present flag is not the one that our Gallipoli soldiers died under.The Monarchy will change when Elizabeth 2 dies. If our Head of State then becomes an Australian, resident in Australia, we would not have the confusion of a surrogate. We would have our own exclusive Head of State not one who represents several countries which at times have conflicting interests (even in such trivia as Cricket and the Olympic Games contests). It must be cheaper in the long run not to outsource our Head of State.

27 Jan 2015 4:44:27pmThe next time we have a referendum on a Republic, it needs to be a fair and proper one, not one contrived to fail from the get go.Howard deliberately contrived the last referendum to fail because HE didn't want a Republic.He deliberately held the Constitiutional Convention BEFORE asking the question because he used the old divide and conquer principle. He forced an unpopular model on voters knowing that they had no option but to vote NO to a republic which was dependent on an unpopular model.A fairer process is:1. Holding a plebiscite, asking the simple question: "Are you in favour of Australia becoming a Republic?"2. Should that be successful - and I've no doubt it would - a Constitutional Convention would then be held to determine two models to be put to a vote.3. A vote is held and the model which achieves the the majority vote would be the model we switch to.This could be achieved over two election cycles with a Referendum held concurrently with the usual election process.
Alert moderator
27 Jan 2015 5:27:15pmThat would be entirely unconstitutional.There would need to be a full referendum (not plebiscite) to change the constitution, with the material changes to the constitution having first passed parliament.That referendum would need to be passed as always, by an absolute majority and a majority of states.It could, indeed, be done in multiple phases, but the final phase would need to be a referendum on the actual changes to be made to the constitution.

The truth is that it show's abbort is out of touch with community expectations, doesn't listen to advice, is on the nose within his own party (or else why leak it) and doesn't understand the role of social media in several recent revolutions. What next- work for the cake?The big question for me is do the libs think it is HIM on the nose or THEM? Whoever gets the gig as his replacement will determine what they are really thinking. My bet is on Morrison- precisely because they don't (or won't) understand it is not just the man but the brand.

Its Australia day, it is a day for honouring Australians that deserve recognition for what they have done.I would imagine royal family would be feeling a bit embarrassed too. What would an Australian Knight hood mean to a Prince and Duke? Is he now Sir Prince Phillip?How does this sit with our "dreadful financial position". TA says one thing and then does that which implies we do not have a problem.LNP members and supporters are simply putting on a brave face to hide their embarrassment.

27 Jan 2015 10:16:11pmIt's rather easy.The Prince was given the highest civilian honour, the Companion of the Order of Australia by the Hawke Labor Govt in our Bicentennial year.The highest award is now the Knight of the Order of Australia, hence maintaining his award as the highest available is sensible and proper.A number of Commonwealth countries have given Prince Philip their highest honours.

27 Jan 2015 6:46:45pmHere's a reason for you:He's an ancient, crusty, racist, sexist holdover from pre-democratic days who has never worked an honest day in his life (sure he was in the military but that's just for show - they don't send prince's into actual battles any more), spent most of his life living off of tax payer handouts (took them from here to come and visit in fact) and who spends most of his time shooting wild life and coming up with "hilarious" comments to humiliate people of other races/sexes/classes or who are disabled (including military veterans) at public and formal events.He has never done anything of real value for the world, much less for Australia.To honor him above Aussie scientists, artists, doctors, military personnel and all other Australian's who have made actual contributions to Australian life and/or to the world is a carefully studied and scripted insult by Mr Abbott who clearly still considers us 'colonials' as being beneath the aristocracy that he holds so dear.
Alert moderator
28 Jan 2015 3:16:23amOh dear just plain wrong. Prince Phillip served in the RN during WW2 on HMS Ramillies and was as at risk as any other sailor. He remained a serving officer until his wife became Queen. His son Prince Andrew served as a RN helicopter pilot in the Falklands War equally at risk as others. His grandson Prince Harry served a term in Afghanistan as a junior army officer. That's three princes who have been in the firing line.

What I believe should happen is that Queensland(oh! we'll have to change that!) should break away from the rest of Australia and Indonesia replace us as the sixth state. Wouldn't that be 21st century modern thinking. After all Queenslanders don't like New South Welshmen and Victorians hate them too because they play an imperialistic game of league.

27 Jan 2015 11:42:35amSpot on lyle. Most Australians couldn't give a toss who gains these awards as there are so many handed out with the majority going to people who have done little more than their everyday job. There are, however, a few who go beyond the norm and do much good for the community and are recognised, but there are many more who don't.
Alert moderator
27 Jan 2015 1:31:33pmIt's because the Prince hasn't set out to benefit Australia or Australians, lyle.  The PM offered the Duke of Edinburgh award as a reason, that's available to all British Commonwealth subjects, it's not specific to us.  He offered that the Prince was a naval officer in the Pacific in WW2.  Not to disparage that, but so were a great number of Australians.  I'm dismayed if that's the best the PM can offer for awarding his new, preeminent award to a person literally "born to rule".  It devalues all of those awards given to people who have contributed a far greater proportion of their energies to the welfare of this country, and to that of their own compatriots.  They've not only achieved more than the Prince's money has, but they've given their own sweat and energy in long-term service, which the Duke of Edinburgh hasn't.  The PM has diminished them by this award.  He can't take that back, and that's unforgivable.  Snide, lefty republican juice, lyle?  You're blissfully ignorant.  What's next?  Posthumous civil honours?  National Canonisation?  The PM's given you no reason to think that it can't, or shouldn't, happen, except for his say-so.  What's that worth?

27 Jan 2015 9:24:02amSome contributors have suggested that Tony Abbott may be experiencing some form of mental health issue.There may be something to that. (Hard to accept that he had no idea what reaction this knighthood would cause.)Recall that disturbing fugue state he entered during a TV interview. I would not discount the possibility that he is in need of help.Someone on his team needs to have a conversation with him and his family to make sure that all is well, and perhaps help ease him out of the job gracefully if possible.
Alert moderator
27 Jan 2015 3:45:26pmYou smear and trash the hundreds of thousands of Australians who battle mental illness just so that you can have a mean-spirited go at our democratically elected PM. You even give him your own psychiatric diagnosis of fugue state which is about amnesia of identity rather than being tongue tied in a TV interview. And no, you are the only contributor here that I could find who suggested his "Captain's call" was due to mental illness. What most often stands in the road of people with mental illness contributing to society is not their 'wacky' ideas but continually being told they are worthless and incapable - that is, the wacky ideas of the finger-pointers. Often this means fighting illness alone not able to tell loved ones or seek relief from counselling and treatment. You could dismiss my comment because I took an inordinate amount of time to write it or because I have psychiatric diagnoses but I agree with the author that this decision was consistent with the PM's ideas: "..we have chosen to be a constitutional monarchy with a monarchist leader, surely giving a knighthood to the Queen's husband is an utterly unremarkable thing to do?" It is an uncomfortable reality of our system of government.

27 Jan 2015 9:38:40amI don't consider myself a lefty, but this appointment says it all. From the time Abbott described "Aboriginal culture" as a form of "Socialism" in the 'Manly Daily' a few years ago, it was evident that this man was so narrow minded he was unfit for office. It is unfortunate for him & the royals, but it is the Australian people who have really been humiliated. This little indulgence on the PM's part will cost him dearly. As with a lot of things with this PM we are going backwards.

Subtlety needs to be delivered with a sledgehammer, it appears. I also find it perplexing to read multiple comments such as "this piece is just another example of lefty/ABC/ALP bias", when clearly Abbott's decision was extremely problematic even for people in his *own* team, and who are among his strongest supporters. This is not a partisan issue - in fact, you'd go a long way to find something that has united both sides of politics so strongly.

27 Jan 2015 9:49:47amIf you are going to have these silly knighthoods etc than I suppose Prince Phillip is as good as choice as any for the services he has done in one form or another.  People forget that many of my father's generation who served in the war, in the Middle East,  had a lot of respect for him.  Some served with him in the navy or were rescued by his ship in dire circumstances etc.  they knew he faced the same dangers as the rest of them.I remember one story my father told me of when Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip came out to Australia shortly after her coronation.  I have no memory of it as I was only a baby in my mothers arms at the time.  It seems an ex sailor, my father knew, in the crowd yelled out to Prince Phillip, Hey Ginger, as he came up to them.  It seems he waved and smiled in response.  Ginger was the fond nickname Prince Phillip had on the ship given to him by those that served with him.   That is even if the men under him did not call him that to his face though he well knew that was what he was called behind his back.

27 Jan 2015 10:04:12amUsing wit and irony used to be a worthy form of satire.Sadly, Domininc... such devices are well and truly beyond the grasp of many of today's Australians, who's education in the use of the English language has been and is more than wanting.  I expect you'll also find our current P.M. also sadly lacking in this regard - therefore, not only will the P.M. not notice the subtle irony of your article; he - along with many of the LNP's finest rusted-on supporters, will assume your words are pure endorsement of something that's actually profoundly disturbing; even to a monarchist like myself!!And what you ask could be so disturbing to a monarchist like myself in what Tony has done re HRH the Duke of Edinburgh?  Well; it's the rather unhealthy 'love' that such an open and public act of reverence embodies. Even someone as dense as Tony Abbott recognises that while some people may have not sought public office; they also don't seek public recognition, regardless of how much fans like Tony Abbott may feel they ought to be humble enough to take it when it's shoved down their throats...I'm sure Prince Philip felt no need for recognition via an Order of Australia knighthood... which brings one to the real reason why Mr Abbott felt compelled to confer one upon him. Perhaps Tony is astute enough to know that he won't feel truly at home until he's back in 'Good ole Blighty', so perhaps he's lining his pathway back to the land that he adores!Oh, and Dominic; try to use gravitas where it's most appropriate and levity when and where it can be more effective.  In this case, gravitas with a smidgin of levity would have been more appropriate than the full-on mocking approach.  Maybe it might have come across better in the spoken word - where inflection, timing and quality of delivery, can radically enhance the meaning and intent of words that, when written; can be so easily misconstrued.

27 Jan 2015 10:07:44amIt is a great pity that the "anti" commentators (what posters do is their issue) have blown the chance to initiate a rational debate about a republic, the system of national recognition, criteria for recognition and related matters instead of piling in with their hatred of Tony Abbott (I certainly don't like about 98% of his government's policies) and the opportunity to take cheap shots to which the target is prevented from responding. There is a serious lack of civility abroad in the country, and it greatly reduces the chance of sensible debate.As part of this, It would be appreciated if writers such as Mr Knight did not repeat urban myths which a moment's research would be shown to be untrue, even if also less helpful to their cause.When Elizabeth and Philip first visited Australia, their stop in Townsville included a display of spear throwing by Aboriginal Australians. Philip met these people. Many years later, on a return visit to Townsville, Philip renewed acquaintance with the spear-throwers and in that context asked "Are you still throwing spears at each other?" By the accounts I have heard, everyone had a good laugh.Just for the record, and to save a lot of people pounding their keyboards in fury, I do support a republic, while worrying about how a head of state would be chosen and the limits on their power (anyone fancy an executive like GW Bush or V Putin? or a harmless if pointless figurehead?) I think we need to be really careful about who should receive Australian honours  - a member of our Head of State's family is not appropriate).For the anti-traditionalists: are we to dispense with the Victoria Cross, named after the Empress of India? Are we to rename the states of Victoria (same person), Queensland (same person), New South Wales (named after a corner of the same person's empire and besides it was Ms Gillard's place of origin) and Tasmania (named after a 17th century Dutchman, for heaven's sake)? Only WA, SA, the NT and ACT have proper Australian names. And the thousands of fawning inappropriate place names?Happy Recovery-from-the-long-weekend Day.

27 Jan 2015 10:52:22amIt certainly is bizarre, but also disappointing.Awarding recognition to somebody born into a life of wealth and  privilege who merely lends his name to hundreds of causes devalues the same potential recognition to others who have actually done something to earn it.I suppose we will make Queen Elizabeth a Dame in 2016.

It mirrors political party back rooms, ALP, LNP, Greens etc deciding who get on the gravy train with a safe seat or a prime spot on Senate ticket.The decision making process was atrocious.

You seem to suggest that the general public, and news organisations should blithely let these things slide, and pass them off as a quaintness of our prime minister.Probably Christine Milne agrees with you. Abbott is capable of spending time in rewarding the Duke for being patron to 800 organisations he would not have the slightest knowledge of, but insufficient time to commit to matters that really count like global warming.Then again, did Abbott comment on the Greek elections, or did he somehow think that his little own goal would go un noticed?If your in the defending Abbott mode you are going to have plenty of work to do.

27 Jan 2015 3:42:34pmActually, "whether he's Australian or not" isn't immaterial because the award is supposed to be to recognise Australians.As for heading up 800 organisations, well the luxurious job he was born into effectively guarantees that, and frankly it's incredibly naive of you to think he's much more than a name on a bit of paper to the vast majority of them. They call these guys "figure heads" for a reason. He's not a CEO steering vast numbers of people to create profit and growth, he's a guy you get to cut ribbons, attend dinner parties, and yes, to put his name to organisations to give them a little more recognition. But look Jack, if you think it was fair and in no way silly or unnecessary to award an Australian honor to a man with the title of: His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Merioneth, Baron Greenwich, Royal Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, Knight of the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle, Grand Master and First and Principal Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire, Member of the Order of Merit, Companion of the Order of Australia, Extra Companion of the Queen's Service Order, Royal Chief of the Order of Logohu, Canadian Forces Decoration, Lord of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council, Privy Councillor of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, and Personal Aide-de-Camp to Her Majesty, then that's great.Just accept that you're not going to have many on your side.

27 Jan 2015 1:04:59pmThe Duke of Edinburgh's Award is an international award, and is given in other countries such as Canada, Swaziland, Lesotho and India (source : Wikipedia).  I can't quite see why this means that Australia has to single him and itself out for special gratitude. Also,  isn't it a bit demeaning giving a Duke a mere knighthood?  Especially one dreamed up by a colonial pooh-bah. I did hear though that he got the electricity put on, on a remote little island in the Hawkesbury, when he came to visit it on behalf of the Outward Bound movement.  The year before the visit, his minders said he couldn't visit unless it had electricity, so the electricity company was forced to do something it had refused to do for years.  Now that has to count for something. (mind you, it seems a bit sissy that the leader of the Outward Bound movement can't survive without electricity.....)

27 Jan 2015 4:24:21pmThe award was invented and run by John Hunt, one of the breed, who just so happened not to like cub-scouts. So he made up his own thing and to try and get some cache he bunged a posh sounding title on it. Just like his wife who works so hard having her name stuck on bridges

28 Jan 2015 11:03:05amThe Duke gets the Kudos from attaching his name to this award, it's not like it comes out of his own pocket.All this does is validate future imperial awards when we already had a perfectly adequate and noble Australian award.

27 Jan 2015 1:25:43pmYawn, getting over this republican excuse of why we aren't a republic. Well excuse me but when choosing such a major change I want to know EXACTLY what we are getting in for (and that is what that question stated), not just a typically politically ambiguous statement like 'do you want a republic'. The republicans expect us vote for yes and trust 'she'll be right mate' attitude, no thanks. If you want a republic get off your butts and show us an alternative that will be better than what we have, otherwise put up with it or leave! Quite frankly I would rather have the queen as my representative than another self serving Australian politician or, a politically correct minority representative.And on this matter, all the fuss over this.

27 Jan 2015 1:55:27pm"I would rather have the queen as my representative than another self serving Australian politician"My feelings, too, MA, on the basis that 1) self serving Australian politicians will inevitably create their own dynasties - similar to what happens in the USA with families believing they have some sort of divine right to rule; and 2) the queen (and her successors) are so far away from us that they're almost inconsequential.

27 Jan 2015 5:21:41pmThe real irony was that the objection was "if it's appointed by Parliament, we'll get a politician", when the very mechanism offered (a 2/3 majority of a joint sitting) almost ensures that politicians won't get anywhere near the job.It was made even more insane by the idea that a popular vote would not return a politician, when a popular vote is exactly how we get all the other politicians we have.The reality was that the Government of the day were determined to scuttle the referendum, and ensured that with both the question and the way it was sold.

27 Jan 2015 3:50:39pmThe problems I have with giving Prince Phillip a knighthood1. Shouldn't Australian Knights be Australian. If not why not knight Bill Gates because I think the Windows OS has a bigger impact on most Australians lives than anything Prince Phillip did and he does a lot of charity work as well.2. The Prime Minister took time out of his day when he could have been doing something more useful (e.g. watching TV) to actually do this.3. The main reason this man was chosen was because he married a princess who later became queen and therefore lived out most little girls dreams with some role reversal thrown in there, isn't that reward enough not to mention all the duchies, Earldoms and Baronies he already has.4. This is supposedly a very high honor to give someone, so what did he do to deserve it? Patronization, lots of rich people do that so what makes him special, or was it his wartime naval service, which again a lot of people did that should we knight every commissioned officer who fought in a war on the same side as us?5. The who thing is a giant slap in the face to anyone who wants to ditch the monarchy which is a pretty sizable minority of the country.6. When I think of how the rest of the world will perceive this act and because of it how they will see Australia as a backwards country full of backwards colonials. Heck its only been in the last couple of years that the BBC has started taking Australia seriously instead of as just some old far off part of the old empire.The reasons I think giving Prince Phillip a Knighthood is in any way positive.1. Umm...

27 Jan 2015 5:32:47pmThis is the most sensible media comment I've yet seen on the topic of Sir Prince Philip.  The only point I would add to it is that the Duke has a longstanding genuine interest in conservation in Australia, and was the initiator of the Australian Conservation Foundation.  But that was so long ago it was before Bill Shorten was even born.I also think it's very unfortunate that critics of the Duke's knighthood are portraying those of us who support constitutional monarchy, knighthoods, etc, as somehow out of touch and unAustralian.  In fact, Australians have twice been asked in official referenda (in 1900 and in 1999) whether they wanted the wearer of the imperial crown to be our head of state, and on both occasions, they voted resoundingly in favour of that outcome.  Fortunately, the republicans and their ilk aren't like the managers of Triple J - they can't simply override popular voting results merely because they don't like them.The truth is that being a constitutional monarchy without bestowing traditional gongs, including on the Royal family, is a bit like being half pregnant, ie it makes no sense at all.  That's something that's recognised in New Zealand, which recently restored knighthoods, and in Papua New Guinea, which never even got rid of them.  I always thought it was very strange to have a Governor-General who wasn't a knight or dame, and I was pleased last year when Tony Abbott made clear that he held a similar view.  After all, if you're going to be a constitutional monarchy, which is what the people voted for, you really should at least make an effort to look like one.So I think the only real mistake Tony Abbott made about this knighthood is that he didn't save it up for the Queen's Birthday, which would have been a nice, and very appropriate, gesture to both the Duke and the Queen.

27 Jan 2015 5:39:03pmI don't agree with the virtue of Tony Abbott's decision.  It is utterly ridiculous.Until Australians all let us rejoice, that we are young and free and rid ourselves of an old irrelevant monarchy it makes perfect sense for Tony Abbott to pander to his favourite family by giving a knighthood to the Queen's husband.  We should not be surprised that he sees this as a perfectly legitimate action.  Abbott may have a high political IQ but has a low political EQ.There are only three solutions:1. Get rid of Abbott with his irrational view of the world 2. Get rid of the monarchy (or both)3. Accept what has happened and stop wingeing

I find the debate, and Bill shorten has a great deal to learn interesting for it shows the lack of knowledge of many as to our heritage and from whence we come. We the People of Australia are part of the British Commonwealth, which is that which Isaac told Ephraim on his death bed. The Scott' if you read their Declaration of Independence 1320 say that they are the Tribe of Benjamin and the Irish are partly of the Tribe of Dan. Our Queen, Queen Elizabeth 2 of Australia Mr. Shorten ,is the Stewardess of the Throne of David. Her Consort has done and is doing a remarkable job even at the age of 90. We should also recall that the foundation of this blessed country stems from our joint Christian, Judaic and British heritage.

27 Jan 2015 11:51:48pmI whole heartedly agree that much of the debate has been degrading, rude and impolite but it is the Australian Standard set by many, past and present, and should come with the logo. You point out "the lack of knowledge of many as to our heritage and from whence we come" but you frame this as "the foundation of this blessed country stems from our joint Christian, Judaic and British heritage. We should all rejoice in this and pray that God will continue to bless us."It is rude and insensitive to many Australians to restrict our heritage to two strands of religion and one nationality - especially on British invasion day and Australia Day. To further suggest we should all pray to your god is a gross insult. This is ethnic-religious supremacy.This narrow view of our heritage is both too Australian and too unAustralian. I believe we have a multicultural heritage but often it is downtrodden, degraded and neglected but this is the living heritage that is really our future. And that is partly why so many criticise Abbott's choice to award Prince Philip.

28 Jan 2015 12:29:12amIf God is blessing us, then why does he tend to bless those who seem to be blessed already more than those who don't?

28 Jan 2015 12:38:53amSorry Peter, but I'm afraid I have no idea what point you are trying to make.  I can see you are offended by criticism of the monarchy, but I'm sure you know, with your apparent interest in history, that the monarchy has been criticised many times in the last 1200 years, from within and without, often with very good cause and not least by the Scots, whose claims to Jewish descent you refer to.  And the Irish, well that's still a hot potato isn't it?  The English themselves have a history of overturning their monarchs and in many cases killing them.  In historical terms this often turned out to be no bad thing for the country and for the people.  No-one here has suggested such a desperate measure, thank goodness.  I would be very interested to read the source for your claim that Isaac told Ephraim on his deathbed that "we the People of Australia are part of the British Commonwealth".  I don't think I've ever heard that before.

27 Jan 2015 8:58:37pmHaving come to Australia 50 years ago and witnessing the massive disconnect from the English origins, I am astounded that Australia still loves to be English and hates to be English at the same time. It does not seem to matter who we "vote" to power, it seems pretty clear who really has the power. Perhaps Abbott is simply being honest about what it is to be Australian? It is a British Award for Brits, after allMaybe after it became a republic they would give an equivalent award to The U.S. President or maybe the Chinese Chairman if they helped us out a lot or endeared us with gaffs? Perhaps Australians in power are frightened of change? Choosing to procrastinate on the issue of what it is to Australian, because it will disturb the status quo and hence their power structures. So they keep the sheep quite with tokens of British origin and ask non-Brit Australians to pledge allegiance to the flag based on a foreign power. Yet to work it out, maybe someone out there can enlighten me?

Along with the negative Facebook postings on this issue, the Prime Minister has been copping anger from members his own party for this silly decision. Regarding Dominic's comment that Australians overwhelmingly voted to retain a Constitutional Monarchy, that was the result of the referendum that was held, but it was rigged for a model that had a President that was elected by parliament. Had the issue been a simple question of "do you want Australia to be a Republic or a Constitutional Monarchy, the results would have been quite different.

27 Jan 2015 9:47:53pmThe whole issue of giving honours and elevating what should be quiet modest achievement is elitist and perhaps we should end the whole farce.This applies to national honours, Olympic medals, Oscars, military gongs and the best garden in the neighbourhood award.The Prime Minister should not be giving out the national awards, the Governor General should and this will keep the politics away a little.Many countries give persons from other countries honours and awards - the French love doing it and some Australians have taken them up. We revel in our folk getting an Oscar, BAFTA or the like or any other recognition, particularly if it comes from overseas. So we should be more magnanimous and less parochial about giving the Duke a pat on the back. It is not often we can offer someone from the U.K. an award for services rendered.For those that have had they coffee spilt and have got a touch of the sulks over the knighthood, lets hope they are just as vocal and judgemental when the next Aussie steps up to receive one from an overseas destination. Poor little small minded and mean spirited "chateau bottled shits". I always thought that Australia had a big heart!

27 Jan 2015 10:40:26pmI voted in favour of Australia becoming a Republic. I dud not vote for Tony Abbott, although I have nothing against the man.  I travel to London regularly and resent enormously having to stand in the "foreigners" line while members of the EU breeze past. I also resent the third degree questions from their immigration people about why I am spending four days in London, especially given that I now live in Nigeria. What woman wouldn't want a break from living under virtual house arrest in her Lagos apartment? A year ago I was ordered to produce "proof" of the address I had been staying at in London on threat of not being able to board my flight to the US. I had no "proof" as my husband was still staying at the hotel. Now I give a friend's address and he is primed what to say if contacted.  I put it down to some kind of reverse racial profiling -picking on the white, middle aged Australian woman to prove no one is being "racist". It pissed me off. and I nearly missed my flight after they erroneously questioned my travel documents-telling me I needed an Esta visa to go to the US when I have a Greencard.  Now Australians who have working visas are having their applications denied due to concerns about the level of EU immigrants. Why do we tolerate it? The "special relationship" is one way. It's embarrassing clinging to a stale relationship when the other party doesn't give a damn.

28 Jan 2015 11:15:40amHaving travelled widely mcorey, you would be aware that most countries have visa requirements unless there is an open border set-up as with the EU and all travellers to Australia other than heads of state etc. are required to have a visa of one form or another and yes, there will with some countries be foreigners and citizens lines.As for what approach the immigration officials of any country may undertake, that will always be a matter for them to abide by whatever regulations and policies might be in place and I doubt you could expect them to know that you have a US Green Card until they do know.Enjoy your travels.

27 Jan 2015 10:48:47pmThe only comment I want to make on this matter is to take issue with your writer who stated that the days that princes went into battle were long gone. We know from many comments here that wasn't true of Phillip it was not true of Andrew, regardless of his morals, and it is not true of Harry. One thing that is true about the British Royal Family  is that they maintain a standard of public service and dedication to duty which must make most ruling families weep.

27 Jan 2015 11:09:56pmDominic Knight's comment show a lack of knowledge about what "overwhelmingly" means......Australians were given only one choice to vote on for a republic, chosen by Mr Howard, and those who voted against it included a lot of those wanting a republic but did not want the model put forward for the vote.Despite this, some 49% of Australians voted for the model put forward, hardly what you would call "overwhelmingly voting to retain the royal family, as said by Dominic Knight, despite them having to vote for an unpopular model.Snip.....Australians were given a choice whether to dispose of our royal family in 1999, and overwhelmingly voted to retain it.....snip

27 Jan 2015 11:32:34pmA perfect choice indeed. An appropriate recipient for a nonsensical award that's been dreamed up by someone who's also detached from reality. The pair are a perfect match.

28 Jan 2015 1:34:33amYesterday, I told my daughter, an Anglophile, a supporter of the current conservative British government and now a British citizen, living and working in London, that our PM had conferred a "knighthood" on HRH, The Prince Phillip.  She was horrified  ... and sadly, embarrassed.  She knew, of course that knighthoods had been abolished in Australia in 1986, the same year the UK and Australian parliaments passed the Australia Act, finally making us independent of Britain.  I am not anti-British - on the contrary I have deep attachments to our British past and to Britain itself.  I strongly believe in the principles of democracy enshrined in our "Washminster" system.  But I am not British, I'm Australian.  I hope the traditions of Britain sustain Britons long into the future.  But I want us to have our own traditions.  I want us to place Australianness ahead of Britishness in creating those traditions.  I know it's hard to define what Australianness is, perhaps that's why our PM looks backwards to another country's traditions - to simplify the task in his own mind.  But in doing so he excludes and alienates multitudes of Australians who have no British attachments.  He also offends those of us with such attachments, who want to feel part of a strong independent nation.  Worst of all, he embarrasses us on the world stage.  Some people's comments suggest that those of us who abhor this regressive policy are making mountains out of molehills, wasting our time commenting on this topic when we should be using our time more constructively commenting on that more important topic.  I remind them that they too are on this page, commenting on this topic.  It might not be important who got the knighthood.  It might not be important that the decision was made without consultation.  But it is important that Mr Abbott has led us backwards - away from our own identity and purpose, to a past that belongs to another people.

28 Jan 2015 11:07:05amr0byns, just picking your comment at random as it is at least less politically biased than most and if your daughter is so horrified and embarrassed, before she rushes home, perhaps you could inform her of a few facts, first being that the award to the Duke is an Australian knighthood and it will always be up to the government of the day to take action on abandoning or re-instating the practice as in this case.There is nothing wrong and unAustralian about any government wishing to have people honoured and both Angus Houston ( an ex Scot btw ) and the Duke have shown fine involvement with Australia, if in different ways.Shorten has already stated that he will again abolish Australian knighthoods and that could be said of him to be not only looking backwards but also inwards with an eye on what the media portrays as their views rather than that of Australians generally.It is your view that people with no connection to the UK may be offended and yet many of those people if recognising that this is an Australian honour could not be offended.As for consultation, honours are usually awarded with mininmal consultation and left to the government leader and rather than feel being led backwards, perhaps you may be able to see that awards should be made regardless of nationality and on merit and could you not agree that such recognition is far more forward, worldly and meritable than fawning over another countries political leader and a TV personality.

28 Jan 2015 12:07:06pmAs you say, Grey it is the prerogative of the government of the day to abandon or reinstate awards. Nor is there anything unAustralian about honouring people who have made a significant contribution to Australia and or Australians.  I am pretty sure I neither said nor implied anything in contradiction of those points.  I'm pretty sure my daughter knows it is an Australian knighthood - and I'm equally sure that's exactly what horrifies and embarrasses her.  I have no comment to make about the relative merits of recipients of the award, nor do I care much whether or not the recipients are Australian, since that is not the point I am making.  Moreover, since I can think of no political leader or TV personality over whom I am inclined to fawn, I am unable to appreciate the comparative value of a national award and "celebrity", which I personally find incomprehensible.My point, Grey, is that our Australian government has exercised it's prerogative to instate an "Australian knighthood" (a term that feels to me oxymoronic; at least the old ones were in a genuine tradition).   We had a perfectly good honour called the Order of Australia, which has been devalued by the government's exercise of it's prerogative, and which has invoked a range of negative responses among Australians from British and non-British backgrounds in what seems to me like a helluva a lot of people, including members of the government and even the PM's own party.  I'm not sure on what basis you assert that people without a British background "could not be offended".  I haven't taken a scientific sample, but there would certainly seem to be at least a prima facie case than many people ARE offended.

28 Jan 2015 8:48:38amDominic, you are either someone with rather dry wit, writing tongue in cheek or you are a misguided, right wing supporter of reactionary politics and an anachronistic monarchy to do with which Australia should no longer have anything beyond friendly relations as with any other nation and some deeply regrettable common history.  Your piece, if it serves any purpose, is like others that denigrate or support this ludicrous award - it just diverts attention from the appalling decision to institute this anachronistic system of privilege - which is the real misdeed.  Had these stupid trappings of grace and favour not been reintroduced then there would be no discussion or otherwise about the relative merits of recipients or potential recipients. Your assessment of Abbott's reasoning and justification for his "captain's choice" which, as you admit, yourself, is an inappropriate metaphor, is dismal.  This action is typical of Abbott's modus operandi and only one of many individual and non- consultative decisions he's made - including the introduction of the awards, themselves.All in all, this is an appalling piece of nonsense and replete with misrepresentation.  Abbott wasn't elected with a massive majority as an inspection of the election figures will show.   In fact, the LNP did not even achieve 50% of the primary vote.  Indeed, only around 30,000 votes separated the ALP and LNP in initial voter preference.  Abbott is a megalomaniac who is arrogant enough to believe he is above the people, the law, and his own colleagues.  He is an avowed monarchist and no doubt did this in sycophantic hope that he will, in return, receive a British knighthood from Queenie. As for your statement that The Australian people voted to retain the monarchy - any half intelligent person knows that such was not the question that was put to the people.  Instead of a clear and unambiguous question on that issue, Howard, another sycophant of monarchy, ensured that the question was complicated and actually asked for choice between types of republic. Had the referendum been properly and fairly framed then the question of republic/monarchy would have been asked without qualification and only afterwards, if necessary need the discussion have been had about alternative systems.  That sort of manipulation of the agenda is a common ploy of the right-wing and enormously effective at misleading the ignorant and the indoctrinated.  However, as is the case with your article, it doesn't fool the intelligent.

28 Jan 2015 10:16:39amget it right mr knight.the Australian people did not vote overwhelmingly to retain the british royal familythey rejected the model put up by john Howard as recommended by the constitutional convention in 1999.Howard  new full well that the polls consistantly showed that the australian people wanted direct election of an Australianhead of state.he made sure that the referundum would fail by only offering the model put up by the convention,ie a head of state nominated and ratified by a two thirds vote of a joint sitting of both houses of parliment.He would not give us a genuine choice and predictably,it failed by 10% Howard then rushed off to London to be patted on the head by the queen for keeping Australia  for the monarchy.

28 Jan 2015 10:55:38amFor the first time in my life I agree with Rupert Murdoch: abolish these titles and gongs for everyone. If ever I were to meet a knight or dame, unlikely, I would refuse absolutely to address them as Sir or Dame. We are not mediaeval serfs. It is great to award people an OA when they have done something special, but too many awards go to people who have just been doing their job.
Alert moderator
28 Jan 2015 11:33:59amWhat has become apparent in all of this mess is that the highest awards handed out on Australia Day are at the whim of the PM - no consultation needed or even sought.This completely demeans the value of these awards.  A knighthood or Dameship now reflects only the personal choice of Mr Abbott.There is a weird irony in all this - Abbott resurrected an anachronistic system and then went on to make it worthless.  Good one Tony, the Royal Family and monarchists will be thanking you for bringing esteem to the Sirs and Dames.  oh, except there weren't any Dames this round - lucky them.

28 Jan 2015 1:03:38pmWhile i am critical of the appointment and moreso Abbotts backward looking fawning for nations other then Oz, to be totally objective, Australia is still part of the English Commonwealth and there is no rule stating that only Australians can receive an Australian knighthood. Furthermore Phil is a patron of many positive groups (yes I know he practically has stuff all involvement in their management or activities). Other nations give national awards to foreigners, France's Legion of Honour comes to mind. If people are so against introduce a rule for future awards or become a republic.I personally have as much issue with Angus Houston getting a knighthood when i distinctly recall him telling the senate estimates committee circa mid 2000s that the Joint Strike Fighter would cost $40 Million each. We are now at, what $114 Million and climbing. Now THAT is a disgrace.

28 Jan 2015 3:09:31pmI'm still trying to understand what the prince has actually done to merit this award. Certainly he's been the patron of hundreds of groups, but what does that actually involve other than rubber stamping an agreement by his office to allow these groups to use the title that was given to him by his wife? Can he actually name any more than a handful of these groups? For example, what is his personal involvement in the Duke of Edinburgh Awards (only a few of which go to Australians)? Compared to any of the other recipients of Australian honours, I doubt that the prince puts in much time at all.

This is my take on it  - I can't find any other explanation.

29 Jan 2015 8:03:48amI find it interesting (yet so symptomatically Australian) that this mass backlash against Abbott has come about from a decision that is entirely inconsequential. Whether the knighthood award went to the prince or it went to an Australian, what does it change at the end of the day? If only Aussies could summon the same level of effort to lambaste Abbott about some of his other decisions, such as the deregulation of universities, which would have / will have massive and terrible consequences.

29 Jan 2015 9:57:39amDominic, your very last paragraph says it all; however you are wrong. Prince Philip WAS NOT BORN A PRINCE; he married a princess. It is therefore concluded that he sought the office and by your own words - unworthy of the knighthood
