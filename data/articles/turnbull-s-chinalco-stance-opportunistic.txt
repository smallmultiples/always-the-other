Treasurer Wayne Swan has labelled Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull's call for the Government to block Chinalco's bid for an increased stake in Rio Tinto as "desperate".In a speech to the Lowy Institute in Sydney today, Mr Turnbull said the Government should not allow state-owned Chinalco to increase its stake in the mining giant, with the decision now before the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB).He also criticised the Government for being inconsistent in its relationship with China.But Mr Swan says the Opposition Leader is "playing opportunistic party politics" over his call to reject the Chinalco deal."He is prepared to risk Australian jobs to save his own job," he said."This Opposition is just not credible and it's desperate."Mr Turnbull has opposed the deal on the grounds that it is not in the national interest."It is the view of the Coalition that the Chinalco/Rio transaction should not be approved by the Treasurer in the form in which it has been presented," he said."Australia's national interest is to ensure wherever possible that the control of its major natural resource assets remains in the hands of companies that will pursue the development of those assets in a way that will maximise the economic returns for Australia."He has also accused Mr Rudd of "helter-skelter" diplomacy with China and of trying to act as a middle man between China and the US."The risk of Mr Rudd representing himself as some kind of trans-Pacific interlocutor is that he will be perceived by the Americans as being overly sympathetic to China and by the Chinese as a bearer of other people's messages," he said.The issue of China has prompted a war of words between the Government and Opposition in recent weeks after Defence Minister Joel Fitzgibbon admitted he had not disclosed a trip to China paid for by a Chinese-Australian businesswoman.The Opposition questioned the Government's links with China, prompting the Government to accuse it of stirring up "yellow peril" sentiments.The relationship between the two countries is likely to stay in the spotlight with the release of tomorrow's Defence white paper, which is expected to outline a naval and air force build-up in response to the growing power of China in the region.
