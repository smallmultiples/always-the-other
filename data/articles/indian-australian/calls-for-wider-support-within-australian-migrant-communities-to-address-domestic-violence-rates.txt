There are calls to dramatically improve and provide more culturally specific support within Australia's migrant communities to help address high rates of domestic violence.While police do not record statistics of family violence based on ethnic or cultural backgrounds, experts say anecdotal evidence shows that rates are higher within migrant communities.One immigrant to Australia, and survivor of domestic violence, is Rakhi and told her story to #TalkAboutIt's Del Irani.Rakhi is not her real name as she does not want to be identified for security reasons.The Indian national came to Australia after marrying her Indian-Australian husband in an arranged marriage.She said the emotional and psychological abuse began early in their relationship. "I noticed his behaviour was very aggressive, very impulsive and used to make comments which hit me really hard," she said."The family where I come from... there was gender equality but after getting married to their family, I realised women were expected to be quiet and not say anything."My mother-in-law used to say I should get ready... she meant I should be in good, proper Indian clothes, wearing lipstick, bindi and everything, just to please him."Rakhi claims there was also psychological abuse from the her in-laws.But she was adamant she would make the marriage work."I gave up my job, I gave up my family to be with him," she said."It was arranged marriage. I thought coming to a new culture, it needs some adjustment on my part. Be it the language, the clothes."But then I realised that adjustment was only coming from my side."I was asked not to wear a particular colour, I was asked not to wear a particular lipstick, everything was decided by him."She claims he also used phone apps to track her movements and set up an email account that allowed him to monitor her online communications.It was not long before the emotional abuse and control escalated to physical assault."I was so frightened of him. I was just being quiet because I didn't know what would come next," she said.But Rakhi was hesitant to go to police or speak out publicly."I didn't want my family to know what I was going through. I didn't want my husband to get a bad name that he was aggressive and so I tried my best... for things to improve," she said.Psychiatrist Dr Mandula O'Connor said it was a familiar story."Where there are patriarchal issues, which are very strong, where there is inflexibility in attitudes, where there is a lack of equality between the two genders â€” that gives rise to attitudes that are more permissive of domestic violence," Dr O'Connor said. She believes Australia needs a "cultural awareness course" that can be used with new migrants, teaching them what family violence services are available to them.It comes as Australian of the Year, Rosie Batty, has been highly critical of the Federal Government's plans to cut funding to vital support services."All the services that support children and family are currently in crisis," Ms Batty said."So we can't say we are supporting family violence when we cut the resources to help respond to the problems."Ms Batty has been campaigning for action on family violence since her estranged partner killed their son, Luke, in February 2014."The awareness is growing but the infrastructure and responses are not there for us," she said.Dr O'Connor said changing male attitudes within migrant communities is the answer to stopping family violence."There are decent men within the migrant communities who are joining in and speaking up and when this number of decent men increase, then that will become the norm," Dr O'Connor said.See the whole #TalkAboutIt episode on Sunday at 1:30pm AEDT on ABC News 24 or iView afterwards.
