A woman stabbed to death in Sydney's Parramatta Park was speaking to her husband in India by phone the moment she was attacked and he "heard her scream".The woman's husband flew into Sydney from Bangalore, India to formally identify the body of IT worker Prabha Arun Kumar, 41.NSW Police separately announced a taskforce would be set up to investigate Ms Kumar's suspected murder as she walked home from work about 9.30pm (AEDT) on Saturday.The mother of one, who reportedly had been planning to return to India in April, was using a public walkway between the park and a golf course in the western Sydney suburb when she was attacked, police said.She was treated at the scene for stab wounds to her neck from a sharp-edged weapon and later died at Westmead Hospital.He heard her scream for help and then plead with the man not to harm [her] and take all her belongings if he wanted Homicide Squad Commander Mick Willing said Ms Kumar was on the phone to her husband at the time of the attack.He said her husband was extremely distressed about the circumstances of his wife's death."She was (on the phone) at the time, we are speaking to her husband as I speak to you at the moment," he said,"We have some detail about their conversation but I don't want to go any further into that at this point in the investigation."As you can imagine, a terrible call to receive, and our thoughts remain with her husband and her wider family."Police Commander Willing said Ms Kumar was last seen on CCTV cameras walking from Parramatta Railway Station and police were urging anyone in the area on Saturday night to come forward.He said it may have been a random attack."We have no reason to believe she was known to her attacker; we're considering all options at this point in time, including the fact it may have been a random attack."He dismissed any speculation the attack may have been racially motivated."We have nothing to suggest that this is a racially motivated attack, I want to reassure you of that," Police Commander Willing said."Now we are considering all options at this point in time, but it's very early in the investigation so it's difficult for me to assume one thing or another."We aren't speculating at all, but we have nothing to suggest at this point in time that this is a racially motivated attack."Ms Kumar's brother-in-law, Thrijesh Jayachandra, told Indian publication The Hindu that she had told her husband she was being followed, before screaming and saying she had been stabbed."She was walking while talking to Arun (her husband) on the phone when she said that a suspicious looking man was following her," he said. "The next moment, he heard her scream for help and then plead with the man not to harm [her] and take all her belongings if he wanted. Seconds later, he heard her scream and say she was stabbed."One shocked resident said Ms Kumar would give flowers to her mother and would often speak about her child in India.Others said they were now fearful to walk through the park at night.Ms Kumar worked for IT firm Mindtree in The Rocks and had reportedly been working a double shift the day of her death.Indian Australian Association of NSW president Dr Yadu Singh said the company had a duty of care to ensure its workers got home safely.Mindtree general manager Anoop George said in a statement the company encouraged employees to exercise caution and would focus on supporting Ms Kumar's family."The Mindtree community is devastated by the horrific tragedy. Our hearts go out to Prabha's family," it said."Our main focus now is on continuing to support the family."We always encourage our employees to be safe and to take every precaution to not put themselves in any situation that they feel is threatening. Mindtree consistently supports our employees in this regard. "I hope you appreciate that this is a very difficult time for all of us."Member for Parramatta Geoff Lee described the fatal attack as an isolated incident, and said attacks in the park were not common."This terrible crime, it's a really isolated incident and it's a real shock to everybody," he said. "And I checked with the park management, and I think this is the first of such incidents to ever occur in Parramatta Park. "And I should let people know it didn't actually happen in the main part of the park."Ms Kumar's aunt, Bharathi Jayachandra, told The Hindu Ms Kumar's brother, who lives in Perth, had also flown to Sydney."She last called me three days ago, when she said it was taxing for her to stay away from family. She complained that work pressure was severe, and she planned to return home for good in April," she said.Her family is expected to take her body back to India for burial.ABC/AAP
