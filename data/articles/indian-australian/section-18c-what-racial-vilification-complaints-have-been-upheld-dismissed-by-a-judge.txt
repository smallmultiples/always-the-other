As the debate over Australia's racial hatred laws heats up in Canberra, Race Discrimination Commissioner Tim Soutphommasane has weighed in, pointing out only a very small percentage of complaints made to the Human Rights Commission are decided by a judge.Warning: This story contains offensive language.The most recent data from the commission shows in the 2015-2016 financial year, 77 complaints were made under section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act.Just over half of those were resolved through conciliation — a process that is usually carried out confidentially, and therefore never makes it into public view. Only one complaint lodged in 2015-16 made it into a courtroom."As things currently stand, you see only a small percentage of matters proceed to court," Mr Soutphommasane told AM.Here is a look back at some of the racial vilification complaints covered by section 18C that have been upheld or dismissed by a judge.A former political refugee from Uganda complained a senior colleague called him a "black c**t" and a "f*****g black, lazy bastard", and made monkey gestures.He was awarded $55,000 in damages.A Jewish man complained a Telstra phone card showing a World War II German fighter plane with a Nazi swastika on its tail was deeply offensive to him.His complaint was dismissed by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which argued the context of the depiction of a swastika would "need to be very different to be unlawful".This complaint was brought on behalf of the Jewish community, which argued material denying the Holocaust published on the Adelaide Institute's website was "malicious anti-Jewish propaganda".The organisation was told to take the material down and to publish an apology. A Chinese woman complained a butcher at Joe's Meat Market called her "ching chong" and remarked to others there he had not seen "an Asian c**t before".She was awarded $2,000 in damages.A man complained his neighbour put up signs in their apartment block reading, "Stupid Serb wog. Go back to your own country wogs", and said — among other things — "You are a filthy Serbian. Go back to Bosnia to get killed."The complaint was dismissed because there was not enough evidence to uphold it.An Aboriginal woman complained her neighbour had called her names such as "c**n", "n****r" and "black mole" sometimes in front of her young son and his friends.The man was ordered to apologise and pay $7,500 in damages.An Aboriginal woman, who was the mother of three young people killed in a car accident, complained about readers' comments about the incident posted on perthnow.com.au. Among the comments was one saying: "I would use these scum as land fill". Another read: "Let 'em all fight and kill each other".The company was told to remove the comments and pay $15,624 in compensation. A man complained the brother of his girlfriend publicly called him "coconut" and "n****r" in reference to his being an Indian-Australian.A judge found some of the insults were reasonably likely to offend and were illegal under 18C.A security officer at the Central Law Courts building in Perth complained a female lawyer racially abused him after refusing a security check. He alleged she told him to go back to Singapore, called him a "Singaporean prick" and repeatedly swore at him.She was ordered to pay him $12,500 in damages and was struck off.An African man complained he had been humiliated and intimidated in a public space when he "was arrested unlawfully handcuffed and detained and his clothes were stripped off". He also alleged a police officer said to him: "I am going to deal with you, you bloody African".A federal magistrate upheld the complaint.
