White is the colour of mourning in Indian culture; white clothing is worn when a person dies.Despite unprecedented media coverage over the past two years, unfortunately there is just as much - if not more - reason to wear the White Ribbon today.Violence against a man or a woman is abhorrent, but the statistics of violence against women are disproportionate and startling.It continues to be a serious national problem with at least one woman a week dying at the hands of her partner or former partner. Domestic or family violence (DV) is also the leading health risk factor for women under the age of 45. Just this week, NSW Police revealed a 40 per cent jump in domestic violence related murders this year.Though violence against a woman can occur irrespective of her age, socioeconomic, religious, cultural or linguistic background, violence experienced by culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) women tends to be unique - for several reasons.Women from these communities can be less likely to report violence.They also experience more barriers in accessing support services and are less likely to leave a family violence situation than other Australian women, according to the third national plan of action on family violence.In addition, the national action plan indicates that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women are 34 times more likely to be hospitalised due to family violence related assaults than other women.It takes a lot of strength and courage to leave a violent relationship. That's why I prefer to use the term 'survivor' rather than 'victim' when referring to a person who has experienced DV.According to the Australian Centre for the Study of Sexual Assault (2011) "Supporting women from CALD backgrounds who are victims/survivors of sexual violence: Challenges and opportunities for practitioners", CALD women DV survivors face additional challenges of a fear of speaking out, including due to possible exclusion or persecution by their community.Women often stay in relationships because they fear the consequences of leaving it. Some cultures exacerbate such feelings, because there are stereotypes that 'a woman's place is in the home' and communities may be out of touch with what is good for a woman in such a situation.I know of cases where community members have not believed a woman's genuine fears.For example, a  man may portray himself as a gentleman with good standing, but his dark side emerges after he faces rejection.Such narcissistic individuals may also try to emotionally manipulate a woman into staying with him by threatening to commit suicide if she leaves him.In such situations, members of a community may find it difficult to believe that the perpetrator is a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde personality and rub salt in the survivor's wounds by not believing her.Women who migrate to or live in migrant communities in Australia may face added difficulties of isolation with little or no family, and/or understanding of English, and/or legal systems and support networks in Australia.Even if a woman has family in Australia, they could make her feel ashamed for taking a brave step of leaving a destructive relationship.In fact, belonging to a particular social group of "divorced women fearful of returning to their homeland" has been a ground for some applicants obtaining refugee status and protection visas.As an Indian Australian, I'm grateful for the cultural values that were instilled in me.But backward manifestations of Indian culture (or any culture), may lead to a woman feeling apprehensive about speaking up for herself.This is compounded by 'victim blaming', gender stereotypes and double standards.A woman who is assertive and/or stands up for herself, may be negatively described as pushy, and someone who is asking for trouble and deserves to be punished and silenced.It's heartening to note a number of preventative and positive steps taken by the NSW and Federal Government to address issues specific to CALD communities and DV. As the former Women's Committee Advisory chair of Federation of Ethnic Communities Council Australia (FECCA), I made submissions to a Senate Committee about the need to collect disaggregated data in relation to CALD women DV survivors, and these submissions were adopted by them.As Women's Chair of FECCA, I also provided input to the Federal Government on measures such as pre-departure information packs created for men and women coming to Australia on a partner visa, which was expanded to other visa holders in 2015.The Family Safety Pack includes information on Australia's laws regarding domestic and family violence, sexual assault and forced marriage, and a woman's right to be safe and has been translated into 46 languages.There is ongoing work to do to address this serious issue.Domestic or family violence is not a private matter â€“ it's everyone's problem and we must collectively address it, not just today but every day.I've written countless articles on DV, and I hope there's a day when I don't have to write about it any more, and we could all wear colourful ribbons.Now that would be something to smile about, like a rainbow at the end of a rainy day.Pallavi Sinha is a lawyer, lecturer and speaker.
