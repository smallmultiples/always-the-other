Gindalbie Metals says the signing of a new deal with its joint venture partner is another step towards strengthening Australia's business ties with China.The iron ore miner says Ansteel has been critical in getting its billion-dollar Karara mine, in Western Australia's Mid West, off the ground.The two have now signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding that will see them explore new resource opportunities throughout Australia.Gindalbie spokesman Michael Weir says the success of the Karara project demonstrates the strength of the partnership."What we bring to the table is knowledge of the Australian resources sector, an executive team to seek out those projects and assess them, and also the development team that can build them," he said."What Ansteel brings, as China's second biggest steelmaker, is a real need for the raw materials. What it can also bring to a development is some very deep pockets."Mr Weir says the company's relationship with Ansteel serves as a good model for future Chinese-Australian partnerships."It's very much based on the fact that each party brings something to the table," he said.
