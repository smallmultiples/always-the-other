Two Chinese landmarks in regional New South Wales have been listed on the State Heritage Register.Blackguard Gully in Young has been recognised as the site of one of the worst riots against Chinese miners in Australian history.Some 3,000 Europeans marched on the Lambing Flat goldfields in 1860.Young Shire Council director of environment and planning, Craig Filmer, says the heritage listing will preserve an important part of the town's history."In terms of history there is the potential for quite a wealth of other archaeological items to be found in that area should anyone have the time, the money or the inclination to go looking in that area," he said."So we are putting that piece of land aside except for public use and saying, if anybody goes to do something there, let's be careful, let's be respectful."The Chinese section of the Nyngan general cemetery has also been heritage listed.Tahria Sheather from the Department of Planning says it is one of the largest collections of Chinese graves in Australia."They're so important as evidence of Chinese burial practices as they were carried out in Australia and how these practices were adapted to the new traditions," she said."The site includes nine grave stones and they're located near a traditional brick burner used to burn food and money offerings to the souls of the dead."The oldest of the grave markers dates to 1913, although it's likely the Chinese first settled in Nyngan following the gold rush of the 1850s and found employment in tree felling and land clearing."The listings are the result of a Chinese Australian Cultural Heritage Study that began in 2005.
