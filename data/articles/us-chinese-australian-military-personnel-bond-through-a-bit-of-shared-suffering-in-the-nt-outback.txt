Australian, Chinese and US military personnel have bonded through "a bit of shared suffering" on Top End soil in a small but significant moment for regional stability.Thirty personnel and their support crew on Thursday completed the final day of Exercise Kowari at a cattle station in Litchfield about 300km from Darwin.The survival training exercise was the first land-based exercise in Australia that involved Australian, Chinese and US personnel working together.It follows Australia's move to build military links with the US while continuing to maintain ties with its biggest trading partner, China.It also follows tensions between China and traditional allies the US and Australia regarding incidents near Hainan Island and the East China Sea.Exercise Commander, Brigadier Peter Clay, said Kowari was a "positive step" for Chinese, Australian and US military relations."We all know there are tensions in the region. You'd be living under a rock if you though that wasn't the case," he said."I see this exercise as like planting a seed and then the seed eventually grows into a tree."The first phase of Kowari involved trust-building exercises, such as abseiling off buildings in Darwin, and survival training from the Australian Army's North West Mobile Force (Norforce) unit.China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) personnel were also given their first taste of Top End predators after attending a jumping crocodiles event on the Adelaide River.The second and more intense phase of the exercise involved splitting personnel into two groups and flying them to remote inland and coastal locations in the Daly River region.They were then expected to hunt, catch and gather food and survive in the bush by themselves.Brigadier Clay was once a survival instructor through Norforce and said there are "benefits of putting people into an environment where you can have a bit of shared suffering"."Shared suffering bonds a group together," he said."They learned how to catch animals, snare animals, how to forage for foods, find bush medicine, fish and build shelters... in an environment where their food was gradually restricted." The first group dived straight into food gathering and ended up with more than 20 fish over the week.The second group was not so lucky and survived off turtle soup, palm hearts and an occasional fish for the first four days.First Lieutenant Daniel Romans of the US Marine Corps with the nickname "Big Hungry" was ravenous by time his group caught a wallaby in a snare trap."It was Lord of the Flies all over again; the mad scramble," he said."It was pretty funny because a lot of the guys were so tired... but we made it and we ended up catching the wallaby."It was the first time that his fellow group member Lieutenant Huang Jin Long of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) had ever seen a wallaby, let alone cooked one on a barbeque."It tasted like beef," he said of the experience.Lieut Huang said the survival exercise was an example of how China and the US could work together with the help of Australian forces."I witness with my own eyes officers and soldiers from three countries trying their best to... win themselves, win the environment and survive in the end."Lieut Romans said there were several hurdles to overcome, including language barriers with the PLA, but the exercise had broken down some military barriers."It wasn't necessarily a military exercise but [we] were out there trying to survive. Chinese, American, Australian goes out the window. "We're human beings who require certain needs," he said.Each soldier was estimated to have lost between 10 and 12kg during the two week exercise.  Rory Medcalf, director of the International Security Program at the Lowy Institute, told the ABC that Exercise Kowari was a "modest-scale exercise" with bigger implications."It shows that Australia recognises the need to work with both the United States and China in developing military forces for regional stability. "It also disproves the claims that building a close alliance with America makes it impossible for Australia to work with China. "We can do both."He said Kowari was about building "cooperation among three countries at the same time" and the next exercise could have a larger scale focus, such as disaster relief, evacuations, stabilisation or counter-piracy.Australia's involvement was not one of diplomatic bridging between superpowers US and China but more as of a "good convener", he said.
