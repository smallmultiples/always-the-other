While Labor's new leadership rules have put the party in a fighting position, Bill Shorten himself starts off as opposition leader with less legitimacy than he otherwise would have had. Peter Chen scans his eye over the new process to see if it was all it was claimed to be.With Bill Shorten elected to the ALP leadership, we now have a chance to reflect on what may be Kevin Rudd's most significant decision during his 2013 premiership: the introduction of direct participation of Labor members in the selection of their leader.This decision, an attempt to prevent leadership challenges of the kind he continued to agitate for under Gillard's leadership, contains both the 50 per cent inclusion of membership in leadership votes as well as a higher threshold (60 per cent of Caucus) to kick out a failing leader.While Chris Bowen emailed ALP members and supporters at 2.34pm AEDT Sunday to let them know "first" the outcome, the real winners of this experiment in party democracy are uncertain. Following the proposal of this model and its subsequent adoption, a range of concerns have been raised about the appropriateness of the new rules. These include concerns about changing the way the party works internally, as well as concerns that poor leaders might not be able to be removed when necessary.Following this first vote, let's examine three claims about the process.The first claim is that the new process makes parties more democratic, and gives ordinary Australian's a greater motivation to join parties.To an extent, this claim is true, but it's overblown. In permitting direct election from rank-and-file members, the ALP can be seen to have responded to one of the consistent complaints of members: that they have no say in the way the party operates today.This was picked up by the 2010 National Review for the ALP National Executive undertaken by Steve Bracks, John Faulkner, and Bob Carr who identified this complaint as a strong driver behind declining membership. But the selection of leadership is a pretty rare event under this model, and the likelihood that new members are going to come flooding in to wait two years (the minimum membership period required to qualify to vote) before they are able to vote in a hypothetical election is not likely to drive membership. Greater levels of branch and online policy engagement from members will be required to meet this claim.One argument we can make, however, is that increased participation in party decision-making shores up the ability of party leaders to claim a mandate for action. While not generally wrong, this claim is questionable in this instance. Shorten's victory does not provide him the unambiguous legitimacy that a pre-reform caucus vote would have given him. Rather than riding into the job on a solid 63 per cent majority, his combined vote is only 52 per cent. Under the old system he'd be able to talk with authority about setting the party on track under his leadership, whereas with this outcome there will be pressure to develop a greater rapport with members (not necessarily bad in and of itself). Given the member's role now disappears until after a (much harder to organise) spill or failure at the next election, his effective support is higher than it looks. But looks in politics is often an important factor.We can question, however, if failure of the rank-and-file's preferred candidate to get up will produce a backlash against the process. This seems unlikely, though poor performance from Shorten in the medium term would see his lack of support from members become a reference point for critics. ALP members have responded favourably to the process, with a turnout rate of 75 per cent. On the surface, this seems a strong response for a voluntary process. On the other hand, that 25 per cent of people who are theoretically so interested in politics that they join a political party didn't participate is interesting enough to ask if some of those branch stuffies didn't get the memo to turn out.One criticism of the process mooted on election day would be that it would impede the ALP mounting an effective opposition during the month-long process.This does not appear to have been borne out. Bowen as acting leader has done as good a job as any person in dealing with the government during its honeymoon period when it has the bully pulpit to itself. In addition, it has been refreshing to see alternative voices taking the running on issues during this period. This shows that the shift towards monopolising media relations in the figure of the leader, as opposed to a more relaxed system permitting free speech to spokespersons and backbenchers (such as in the UK), can introduce new voices and talent into the process (Mark Dreyfus's intervention into the expenses scandal was less than impressive, however).The number of problems that the Government has got itself into in the first month has been pretty impressive, and a clearer leadership team might have made more capital on them. But this is a long way from seeing the leadership process as negative navel gazing.Following a resounding electoral defeat, and the punishing lessons of the last two terms, the ALP needs to do more than simply get on with the job of opposing. The leadership debates allowed the competitors to discuss areas of ALP policy outside of the context of an established party policy, allowing for changes in position (such as immigration and welfare benefits) to be developed, rather than announced as u-turns.The use of campaigning literature and events has also allowed the two leadership aspirants to practice the articulation of their positions prior to coming into the position of leader, another positive for effective opposition over the next three years, as opposed to in the first month.Possibly the most significant claim is that the mixed-election process will make leadership campaigns more like American primary elections. This may introduce elongated campaign periods (taking key figures away from their official tasks to campaign) and lead to more "money politics", where leaders are increasingly beholden to campaign donors.While the constrained time-frame of the current campaign negates the first concern (though potential leaders may spend more time positioning themselves with members prior to elections in the future rather than campaigning to the general public), there is evidence that the second may be the case. Bill Shorten's campaign - which produced slick booklets for members outlining his case - received direct funding from a number of right-wing ALP unions. This is in addition to the $50,000 each campaign was allocated for communication from the party's National Executive.Does this mean that the practice of money politics will infect leadership races in Australia? The jury on this remains out. While some will point to the receipt of money by the Shorten camp as emblematic of the ALP's "capture" by the union movement, the truth is that Labor-affiliated unions always influence leadership contests, through their influence in the party's internal practices and factional alignment. What this does, therefore, is make the normally-opaque practices of power in the ALP more visible. Certainly the party should, if it wants to maintain its argument that this process is democratic, put some constraints (such as expenditure declaration requirements) on the campaign process. The receipt of funds does sit uncomfortably with Shorten's commitment to further party reform, which is unlikely to include decreasing the role of unions in party conferences beyond the recent normalisation between states.Overall, it is this area of campaigning that is likely to develop over time. In this first contest, both candidates refrained from bare knuckle attacks of the type seen in US primary races, including the use of third party attack ads and open season on muckraking.This likely reflects uncertainty about the nature of these votes on the part of the candidates, who appeared unsure of how far and hard they should push the election. Given Australia's recent history of vitriolic and unpleasant political discourse (between, but mostly within parties), this level of civility is unlikely to be seen next time.Peter John Chen is a politics lecturer in at the Department of Government at the University of Sydney.

14 Oct 2013 12:43:02pmRobert, I've seen no evidence that Abbott will be a great Prime Minister.  Instead we see a sordid squabble about whether or not he can claim expenses for riding his bicycle in a charity event.Given the way he hounded Slipper for a few dollars in expense claims, why doesn't he save us time and resign now?

14 Oct 2013 1:46:27pmBig difference.TA didn't attempt to hide his claims across multiple expenses. He put in his claim, and then paid it back. One trip, one expenses claim.It is alleged that Slipper attempted to hide the charges across multiple bills and caught out. One trip, multiple expense claims.
Alert moderator
14 Oct 2013 5:07:46pmIs that all, rudski?  Abbott put his expenses in one bill and Slipper put them in multiple bills?  That's what separates our Prime Minister from the worst of the worst?Remember, Slipper is the ex-Liberal guy that the Coalition spent at least a year dumping on day after day.  Every news item was about how bad the Coalition thought Slipper was, and how foul and unreasonable it was that Labor could support him.He was so bad that just being nice to him was enough to taint you.  Remember that?And it's just a matter of accounting style that separates him from the PM?  I didn't know you were so anti Abbott.

14 Oct 2013 7:34:02pmAbbott also claimed for attendance at the 'worst of the worst's' wedding. Does he really think that attendance at the wedding of a work colleague is a business expense? Have you ever been legitimately convinced that attendance at a work colleague's wedding is something your company should pay for? Submitted a claim? Lodged it in yr tax return as a deduction? Thought not, me neither. We've all been given a glimpse behind the fancy foyer into the grubby staff area of Hotel Abbott. All that charitable cycling? Simple campaigning in marginal electorates. All that concern for the plight of Aborigines? Ditto. The hand of friendship? A deductible expense. If there's not a claim nor a vote in it then I'm afraid you'll have to cart your own bags up to the room.

15 Oct 2013 8:37:42amHoward stayed to long.And when he won control of the senate, pushed through reforms that should not have been pushed, that is Work Choices.He did win many elections, so was clearly thought to be a good PM for many years.The public turned on him when he went to far, with issues like Peter Hicks, and work Choices, and was then given his marching orders.It happens to every PM in the end.Rudd on the other hand, won just one election, or more to the point, Howard lost it.Gillard didn't win a single election, but managed to hobble together a coalition that allowed her to be PM, the LNP actually won more seats that the Labor Party in that election. (For the record, I think she would have been great if she had had a majority).I think Howard did OK for many years, but for me, work choices and Peter Hicks were more than enough reason to say time for someone else to have a go

15 Oct 2013 9:55:10amThis idea that if people vote for a party then the respective leader must be a good PM is absurd. Julia Gillard was a good PM, though no-one specifically voted for her to be PM.Sadly, people vote for the party they believe will provide them with more money in their back pocket.

14 Oct 2013 11:52:40pmRobert, the Labor party shot itself repeatedly in the foot with reckless infighting.  That was dumb.  But sordid?  No, mate.  Just daft.Really I don't care about Abbott skimming a few dollars here and there.  It's the hypocrisy that has me riled.  If Abbott can spend so long trying to nail Slipper's head to the wall and then do the same dodgy expense claims himself and all we get is "Oh, did you notice my hand in your pocket?  I'll just put your wallet back.  No harm done." then that's Hypocrisy on a Grand scale.If Abbott hadn't done such a song and dance about how he was such a superior being and Slipper was such a slimeball, I'd probably not care much.  As it is, I think he owes Slipper the longest and humblest of apologies, and then a bigger one for the rest of us.

14 Oct 2013 8:43:03pmI completely agree ingenuous. Not only should Abbott resign now to save time but to save us from the sorry spectacle of this man representing us overseas. His hypocrisy is breathtaking.  The amount of money he has claimed for expenses for a range of events, including Peter Slipper's wedding, is substantial and yet he was the one who lead the attack on Slipper.

When the Opposition leader outspends a sitting PM by nearly double in expenses it is clear that something incredibly fishy is going on. If ALP parliamentarians have rorted the system to the same extent please give us figures, we want them hauled across the coals too. So far one has been caught out in this net for less than $500.If you think Abbott is looking anything less than out of his depth so far you standards are incredibly low.

14 Oct 2013 2:03:24pmRobert great PMs tend to do things.  Greatness will require Abbott to actually do something. Watering down his rhetoric on boats then withholding the information is not an achievement as such.Taking up stopping the waste, then deferring his budget statement until next year is not an achievement. What were the other two slogans? He is on track to be a small target disappointment.

14 Oct 2013 2:18:37pmYeah! Instead of mumbling 3 words mantras, his bosses have told him to Zip the Lip. After a couple of stuffups, we'll see a spill for leadership among the Libs. Keep working on it Mal.

14 Oct 2013 3:50:50pmA leadership spill??, I highly doubt that as the far right loons have control of the 'Liberal' party at present and Tony is their man. Further more, after the faux outrage they emitted when Labor dumped Kevin, screaming about "bloodbaths", "instability" and "assassinations", if they did the same to Tony they'd be politically crucified at the next election, even more so than Labor was in 2010. That's the beauty of it, Abbott has already begun lurching from one disaster to the next, the polls are already turning, he's gonna drag the party down with him and they won't be able to do a thing about it, it is actually brilliant and is going to be hilarious to watch.

14 Oct 2013 4:38:20pmPaul, thanks for a great post.I was especially impressed with "Tony, the highest paid volunteer in the country", a very bitter truth which certain LNP trolls might have some trouble digesting. It's a devastating line because it cuts through to what's at the very (non-)core of our new PM.I also agree that Tanya will be an excellent deputy leader - and the stark contrast with Julie "Indian weddings, parties, anything" Bishop will also do Labor a lot of good.And that's very good news about the poll - it seems that the voting public are waking up to Abbott much more quickly than I'd anticipated! So if in the near future, Malcolm Turnbull suddenly breaks into a silly grin for no apparent reason, now I'll know why...
Alert moderator
14 Oct 2013 5:47:45pmA DD will strengthen the colaition's position, but I believe PUP will offer support for Abbott not to trigger one. Support beyond 1 July 2014. I understand the coalition, as opposed to the ALP, want to keep the promise of scrapping the CT as their first act, however, they can only put the bill to the Senate. Then it is basically up to Labor as to whether they want to continue to side with the Greens as they have done for the last 3 or so years or side with what the electorate voted for. It seems as though Shorten wants to side with the Greens. This will be a political win for the coalition (at the expense of the environment as it delays the introduction of Direct Action which will certainly reduce emissions more than the CT albeit at a higher cost to the Government).And don't look at the polls just yet. The enormous increase in both consumer and business confidence due to the removal of an anti-business, anti-consumption government will pay dividends but only over the coming years, not right away. I know my family are free to spend again, knowing that there will be no big new imposts on our hgousehold budget like there has been for the past 6 years. I know, I know, we are "rich" according to the anti-aspirational Labor party. TA probably cannot afford to give back what Labor have taken away (super concessions, health care rebate etc) and squandered, but we now know it won't get worse and, furthermore, some relief (in the form of lower taxes or increased benefits) MAY be achievable in 5 or 6 years if we can pay down Labor's debt rapidly (unlikely, though). We know our electricity bills (which are higher the more kids you have) will be reduced by 1 July 2014.Also, our budget position will improve beyond current estimates due to the increased business confidence, especially in the resources sector. For 6 years, miners have had to deal with a hostile Government. Now that a pro-business (and therefore pro-jobs) Government is in place, projects that were marginally unviable will become viable due to the removal of sovereign risk factors that have plagued the sector for the last 6 years which has manifest itself as a gradual tailing off of NEW mining investmnent decisions.Give it a couple of years of a decent Government and people will see just why the Labor/Green coalition is so toxic to our economy. In the short term, however, things will deteriorate a little as government policy (good or bad) takes at least a few years to affect economic indicators. Like when ignorant people say it was the ALP who got us through the GFC....hahahahaha.

15 Oct 2013 12:11:31amTodd, I think you've got every major call wrong here.Everyone loathes DD elections.  The public will punish anyone who calls one.  If Tony calls one, he had better have a huge lead to spend.You are the only person I've ever read who suggests Direct Action is anything but a smoke screen.  It will be expensive (polluters are already holding off in hopes of a free lunch) and utterly ineffective (as I said, polluters are just pumping out CO2 and hoping for money to rain on them).  The existing Labor/Green scheme is enormously better and definitely worth fighting a DD election to keep.Yes, Australians are rich.  Poor Australians are richer than most world citizens.  Keep some perspective.  And electricity bills rule your life?  Only in LNP propaganda.You hitch all your hopes to a new mining boom when the last one enriched overseas companies, not Australians.  We missed out on almost all the benefit of the mining boom because Howard and then a sequence of Labor governments failed to tax the mining companies.  They laugh in your face as they take the money home with them.  And that's *our* minerals they make their money from.I don't expect this pro-big-business anti-environment government we have now will let any of the money trickle down to the plebs.  You must have lots of mining shares if you think any of the good times will flow on to you.

15 Oct 2013 11:49:51amInteresting, my husband and I have 6 children and I can't think of any restrictions on our spending over the past few years that were a direct result of any ALP policy. Granted we have solar panels which mean we get an electricity rebate rather than bill, although that saving is against charges necessitated by infrastructure and other costs, not the carbon tax.As for the carbon tax, the ALP should not and will not turn their back on a very effective policy which has caused minimal impact to household budgets. Abbott does not have a mandate for its repeal, he didn't get control of both Houses. All other parties and independents need to vote according to their own policy platforms, not to bolster Abbott's agenda.

And, you don't mind telling us ad nauseam what you think either, so we (anyone on the conservative side of politics) know who is putting this idea of power at any cost out there.  Recall the last election where the only two policies that Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard had in the 6-8 months leading up to it was to stop TA becoming PM.  Their policies for governing the country were either secondary to that one, or not mentioned at all.  It was one of the weirdest things I have ever seen, politicians totally fixated on negative dismissal of a worthy opponent and unable to believe he could occupy their positions of power.  They were aided and abetted by many of the same commentators here like yourself Daisy who share exactly the same opinion.There are a group of 'born to rule' in this country and they are almost exclusively of the Left, and to find them you only have to look in the mirror.

14 Oct 2013 11:31:49amRobert,We all know that Abbott is not up to the job. A hell of a lot of us knew it before the election, and everybody knows it now. But his total lack of suitability for the role is a trait shared by his two most successful predecessors: John Howard and Sir Robert Menzies. Both were incapable of leading the country and their long incumbencies did immense damage to our econonmic and political sovereignty. But did this damage their chances of staying in power? Not a bit.Thanks to overwhelmingly supportive and entirely deceitful propaganda from our heavily monopolised media services, some of Menzies and Howard's most destructive and debilitating policies were among the most popular.Abbott has learnt well from Howard and his extraordinary efforts to vilify and marginalise opponents and even innocent bystanders like asylum seekers have been both breathtaking and enthusiastically supported by the most intense propaganda blitz in a western nation since Germany in the 1930s.Even in the hands of a maniacal wrecker like Abbott, Australia's decline will take some time and, in the meantime, you can guarantee that the popular press will trumpet ever minor "achievement" while conveniently ignoring the failures, internal squabbles, the fraudulent, backroom deals with foreign plutocrats and serial rorting of the public purse.It will be up to the Labor Party, mainly via social media, to hold this rabble to account. We cannot expect any assistance from Rupert's press. You need to remember that Australia is being run from New York now, not Canberra.

14 Oct 2013 2:12:19pmFitz,"Bloody hell, v: - do really think that Mr Murdoch has that much power and influence? "No, I KNOW that Mr Murdoch has that much power and influence.Consider the evidence:*Murdoch, with his co-conspirators David and Charles Koch, already control an extreme right-wing faction of the Republican Party known as the "TEA Party" (TEA stands for "Taxed Enough Already"). The aim of the TEA Party is not to control the governemnt, but to destroy government and replace it with corporate dictatorship. This is why they are currently working so hard to achieve a debt default.*Murdoch's "education services" companies are doing very well out of the privatisation of American Public Schools under the guise of "greater community autonomy", being pushed by the "Charter School movement", wich is sponsored by, guess who: News Limited and the Koch Brothers. Hidden among the policies taken to  the last election by the Liberal Party, was a promise to "increase community autonomy in the running of pubic schools".*Foxtel controls the distribution of entertainment-related IP in Australia through its near-monopoly on high-speed cable video services. THe NBN would have delivered a level playing field, allowing other IP owners to compete with FoxTel. Abbott's promise to "wreck" the NBN is tailored directly to protecting FoxTel's monopoly.*Murdoch's media outlets in Australia initiated and led the campaign to replace two Liberal leaders and two Labor leaders in the space of seven years.The aim of Murdoch and the Koch's campaign is to end the dream of democracy and re-establish the power and priviledge enjoyed by the corrupt aristocrats of nineteenth-century Europe. The TEA Party has taken up the work of the likes of Prescott Bush and the British Royal Family, who both enthusiastically supported AND BANKROLLED Hitler's rise to power with the same end in sight.Murdoch and the Koch's obviously beleive that the Murdoch Press's long campaign to undermine our faith in democracy and our elected governments has now progressed to the point where they can do away with government and realise the ultimate goal of Mussolini: "the wedding of corporation and state".Our freedom and our way of life is currently under greater threat than at any time since 1945 - and this time we don't have the Red Army and the brave people of the Soviet Union to save our bacon.

14 Oct 2013 6:57:03pmYou raise some fair points v and I agree with some of what you say. There are too many lobbyists paying to get their message to various politicians and I include that ex-Australian Murdoch among them. However, you do not have to subscribe to Foxtel, or read Murdoch press. I don't. Mainly because I consider it crap and not because he pushes a barrow for either the Coalition or the ALP, depending on his mindset at the time. There are plenty of other places to get informed opinion or straight news and then make up your own mind on the balance of information.Like you, I am concerned about the future direction of politics here and elsewhere. The military-industrial complex in the USA is firmly in charge there and promoting themselves no end, with scary tales of what will happen if they don't have sufficient "security". As a result, we now have a situation where the NSA (in the US), GCHQ (in Britain) and also Israel (what??) receive masses of metadata which comprises our total internet usage. We may not be singled out for "special treatment" in the short term, but political parties and governments can change and this metadata can be retrieved and used against us. I probably don't have to mention "Five Eyes" to you, but other readers may like to Google it.As for pre world war two support for Hitler, who figured on the front page of Time magazine in 1938 as "Man of the Year"? Many people agreed with him, if not his methods.As for the Soviet Union, Stalin killed off something like 30 million of his own people, including most of his upper echelon military, purely due to his own paranoia. Had he not done that, the German invasion of 1942 might have ground to a massive halt long before it did.

14 Oct 2013 2:34:36pmFitz,"I do agree, however, that Australia should not be "run" by the US or any part of it."There is no question of Australia being "run" by the "United States" any more because the "United States" is very close to being a spent force as a nation.By its very nature, international capital is independent of any nation and ultimately untouchable to the laws of any country. Many corporations are content to simply play the traditional role of the parasite, leaching unobtrusively off the wealth-creating labours of human beings and relying on the twisted hegemony they enjoy to keep us in their thrall and the natural tendencies of the capitalist "free amrket" to build and strengthen their monopolies.Rupert Murdoch, the Koch Brothers and their TEA Party represent a level of direct plutocratic activism not seen since the collapse of Weimar Germany and the rise of Hitler (both engineered by leading plutocrats and aristocrats including the Bush and Walker families in the US and elements of the British Royal Family). Rupert Murdoch, the Koch Brothers and their TEA Party have already succeeded in bringing government in the US to a grinding halt. They DON'T CARE about the world economy, or about US pride, in fact, the worse conditions become and the lower the US sinks, be better it will be for them.This is not politics as we have been used to it. My grandfather remembers what happened last time the plutocrats got this cocky. 6 million Jews, 20 million Soviet citizens and uncounted millions of Gypsies, homosexuals, freemasons, catholics, Slavs and Asians can't - because they were the victims.We cannot allow ourselves to be tricked by our own fear and laziness as the Germans were in the 1930s.

Alert moderator
14 Oct 2013 8:32:00pmAbbott will have to recall parliament first, before the process for DD can be set in motion.As he is delaying all, till the last possible date, there is little likelihood of a DD in the next six months or so. After that it will be unnecessary, after the newly elected Senators take their seats.Abbott is just a lot of hot air, and full of stunts.Likes sounding tough.,

Alert moderator
14 Oct 2013 11:39:14amAlbert,I suspect that the many reforms made by Gillard, in coopreration with the cross benches in this area will be a thing of the past under Abbott. This is a great pity because, despite the difficulties presented by the make-up of the last parliament, it was our most successful ever and you would have to be an absolute idiot (enter Abbott - stage [extreme] right) to tamper with the reforms that made this possible.It is quite normal for new governments to be champing at the bit to get parliament back into gear and have often in the past recalled the House of Reps within a week of the election. Abbott's apparent reluctance to have anything to do with parliament is a worry. He appears to hold the parliament in contempt and, at teh moment, it looks like he intends to adopt a style more presidential and dicatorial than anything we have seen before.Unfortunately, Question Time is always one of the greatest losers when a Tory government is in power. They have no interest in transparency and, as they see themselves as "born to rule", see any attempt to hold them to account as an affront to the natural order of things.
Alert moderator
14 Oct 2013 4:29:58pmI'm really looking forward to question time. Abbott played on its being televised to make outrageous comments and question for the last X years. Personally I think it's a pity it was ever available so easily on TV. Not because it means more scrutiny, but because what makes good TV is not necessarily informative. Like train crashes and fires, outrageous behaviour makes good TV, regardless of the subject matter. Having to consider the detail of words (as read in Hansard or heard on radio) are not as photogenic and so detail, proper consideration of what is actually asked and answered, what this illuminates about policy and outcomes tends to take second place to the spectacle. It's this that Abbott played on, and while effective, I sincerely hope the new opposition does not go down that road. It's so easy to degenerate into kindergarten tit for tat. I will always hold Abbott accountable for the levels parliament sank to in the last two governments.
Alert moderator
14 Oct 2013 7:01:28pmvSorry, but I disagree about the "born to rule" bit. Both the Coalition and the ALP are as bad as each other and yes, one can expect them to try and undo some of what has gone before. That's the nature of politics.

14 Oct 2013 11:08:19am'Govern and be damned' can the motto of the best governments, and in the case of the Gillard Labor, was.It is a sad comment on so many contributors that they treat good government so dismissively. Look around the world; how many examples of bad government do you want?   Do you think that their peoples enjoy the exercise?The same people who rail against the supposed evils of the supposed nanny-state culture of entitlement seem to take very much for granted fair treatment with high standards of regulation, yet the world out there provides very few examples of it just happening. It happens because the targets of that railing struggle against exactly such people to provide it.Many appear in denial about the real nature of an Abbott government. Note their anxiety to avoid looking to Europe, to an English-speaking country like the U.  K., to see what Abbott the Hun's Austerity does. It does it to businesspeople just as happily as to the factory fodder in the housing estates!Wishful thinking may be the hallmark of many in the business world and a degenerate mainstream media in their blind denial of the reality of the party that they nevertheless want - but it is the dark side of human nature, despised by any good government and shunned by all decent people. Govern and be damned to such ugliness, I say.Labor chose principle in its loyalty to Julia Gillard in Rudd's March '13 non-challenge.  They preferred a 21st Century leader to a revenge-obsessed traitorous control-freak notwithstanding the enthusiastic forecasts of obliteration, the opinion polls' favourite being a half-human visitor from the Palaeolithic. Labor Caucus' vote on the 21st of March '13 was in fact a truly heroic moment in Labor history, which will do them far more good, especially in the long-term, than any of the supposedly more politically palatable alternatives.  That they reversed their position three months later was politics - fairness counts for very little when facing the need simply to survive a relentless media onslaught eagerly fanned by a filth of rats in the ranks.

14 Oct 2013 2:54:21pmlazarus,"Aiming for more incompetent than Billy McMahon if vthat was possible."Tony Abbott has more in common with Billy McMahon than just a pair of enormous ears with nothing between. As has been revealed over the years (quietly) McMahon betrayed his country and his colleagues in government by selling trade-sensitive cabinet secrets to Japanese companies involved in trade negotiations with Australia. We still are still paying the price of his treachery. He was, in fact, a foreign agent, but not an agent for a foreign government - his sponsors were corporations, not intelligence services.Abbott's sponsors are not Japanese corporations. They are multinational corporations and the most prominent and influential of these is News Limited, News Limited is a vast corporation with reserves larger than most nations on earth, and which effectively controls the Republican Party in the US through an artificially-created, extreme-right faction known as the TEA Party.As you can see every night on the news, the TEA Party is progressing well with its plan to remove the kast vestiges of democracy from US politics by crashing the world economy and creating an emergency - creating the ideal environment for the emergence of an American Hitler, Franco or Pinochet.The last time there was a serious outbreak of fascism, over a hundred million people died, much or the world's productive capacity was destroyed, millions were displaced permanantly from their homelands, and we were saved, and only just, by the courageous resistance of the Soviet people and the Red Army.If we let it happen again, who will save us this time?

14 Oct 2013 12:09:28pmBighead,Do you have ANY idea what a "Gerrymander" is? Clearly not. This is very surprising in a Tory, considering that Gerrymanders were the invention of the right wing. Coming from any Tory, the word "gerrymander" can only be a weasel word (one chosen for its negative connotations rather than its applicability to the context).You cannot have a "gerrmander" without electoral divisions and electoral boundaries. This is because a "gerrymander" is the deliberate manipulation of electoral boundaries in order to effectively give some votes more weight than others. The two ballots were both NATIONAL votes without any electoral boundaries and therfore could not have been subject to a "gerrymander".If you want to see a "gerrymander" in Australian politics, you have to go back to Bjelke-Petersen in Queensland, whose blatant interference in the electoral processes saw him repeately elected with lower than 20% of the popular vote.

14 Oct 2013 1:58:05pmPeter the Lawyer,It is blindingly obvious that the only way a 50/50 weighted vote can be obtained is by dividing the majority vote by the minority vote. In this case the total ALP valid membership votes (30K+) was divided by the number of politicians and weighted accordingly.  It was not a secret that this was they way it was designed to be because at no time was it suggested that the vote was to be other than 50/50.

They are almost all rather normal, so why should it be any surprise that they don't want an ABNORMAL political party?
Alert moderator
14 Oct 2013 1:28:56pmBean Counter,This hypothetical 99% of people would be wrong then.Most people get value from their personal effort only because of the vast network of goods and services that surround them.  If I'm an office worker, say, I can't work without electricity, running water, supermarkets, public transport, clothing importers, computer manufacturers and Google, just for a start.  Try living in the scrub with just sticks and stones and see how far you get.Nobody exists in a vacuum.  No family exists in a vacuum.  Everyone depends on society.  It is the health and wealth of the society you live in that most directly predicts your income and quality of life.  People in Australia are rich because they are in Australia, not because they are better or harder working than people in, say, Somalia.Voting for a political party that tilts the public purse towards rich industrialists at the expense of the rest of society is clearly against our interests as citizens.  And yet it happens.And now I know why:  people don't understand or value the society they live in.

14 Oct 2013 4:45:35pmYou almost had it right until you slipped into your delusion again. Under the last government we where tying to borrow our way out of debt and spend debt to fix the economy. Recipe for collaspe, lucky the voters woke up even if you didn't,  hey!
Alert moderator
15 Oct 2013 12:34:31amSmeghead, do you have any argument against my point beyond name calling?  We Australians are rich mainly because we are in Australia, not due to our intrinsic worth or hard working nature.  We have riches that others in foreign countries do not, but not because we are harder working or deserve it.  It's simply in our hands due to dumb luck.  The rampant sense of entitlement to riches, well, that's something else.  That's the burden you all must discard as soon as you can.  It negatively affects your judgement.And it makes perfect sense for a government to take on debt in bad times and pay it back in good times.  The Australian government has a low debt level compared to other major economies.  There is significant room to move.Even Joe Hockey agrees these days.  Economic crisis?  What crisis?  No problem now.  That was just an election thing.  High spirits, you know how it is.There was never a debt problem, there was just a propaganda points scoring exercise.  Now that the contest is over, the debt problem has vanished.  Hazzah!

14 Oct 2013 12:46:14pmRudd brokered the first major reform of Labor in its history. He will go down in history for this positive change.Sure the rules may well need adjusting, but now the process is started, it will be impossible to put the genie back in the bottle. Rank and File members know this initial process will have to be refined, but to see a political party in a supposedly democratic country actually embrace democracy - that is wonderful.I would actually go further and say that this may make Australians demand all political parties should be able to prove they are run democratically. Wouldn't that be wonderful.Imagine the Libs/Nats coalition having to be run democratically, or the Palmer party etc. Happy days.

14 Oct 2013 4:21:34pmHilariously funny to hear the conservative lobby refer to the ABC as pro-Labor, or Labor partners.In the midst of the gutter (spelt M U R D O C H) press exaggerating every Labor fault or failing and wrongly representing positive things, the ABC reported these factually... often to the embarrassment of the Labor party.Trouble with you rusted on conservatives is that anything that isn't bashing Labor is seen by you as pandering to the loony left.Pity you don't think a bit.

14 Oct 2013 10:19:07amAndy, the ABC gives plenty of opportunity for gilded-on Liberal lovers like yourself to express their prejudices.Abbott's failure to "Stop the Rorts" is something that will continue to haunt him. I am sure that there are more tax-payer funded wedding attendance and the like to be revealed.
Alert moderator
14 Oct 2013 12:45:02pmrabbie- Where exactly would a conservative go on ABC, apart from this very small forum, to, as you so quaintly say, 'express their prejudices'? Would it be, say, Q&A, or Insiders perhaps or possibly Lateline or Radio National? And then we see the superbly unbiased Media Watch? Yes, there's certainly plenty of balance from the ABC, not. One thing Abbott should do, and I dare say if he did he would have a hell of a lot of support from the majority of Australians, would be to simply ensure that the ABC was made to follow it's own code of conduct. It actually says the national broadcaster is not to show any bias which I suggest is something the present luvvies have either missed or have decided to ignore and it's way past the time they were brought into line. No bias, either way is what is needed.
Alert moderator
14 Oct 2013 1:35:28pmPeter, when you say "the superbly unbiased Media Watch", this is literally true.  Media Watch bashes bad journalism everywhere, including bad journalism from the ABC.If you find Media Watch a problem, look to your own biases.  The bad journalism is there to cater to your prejudices, but that does not make it good journalism.Also, recognise that when you call people "luvvies", etc, you are betraying yourself.  If you are saying "people who support the ABC are automatically wrong" at the start of a discussion, do not be surprised to see push back against your position.
Alert moderator
14 Oct 2013 1:49:44pmPeter over the last 15 years there have been 3 separate research organisations look into perceptions of bias by the ABC (that I am aware of), at least one of them was funded by the Liberal party itself - only one (by the ANU) saw any bias and that was towards the Liberals - which is what I kind of expected from them.  Just because they are critical of the right and do positive pieces about the left does not make them biased overall. They are also critical of the left and do positive pieces about the right.  It's about balance.I have seen plenty of right wing commentators on Q&A and Insiders and heard plenty of them on Radio National. I think your own bias is showing.
Alert moderator
14 Oct 2013 1:50:09pmPoWA.... Previous examinations of ABC bias have consistently shown, that where there is  bias  shown at the ABC, it is to the 'right'.As you say correctly, the ABC should follow it's code of conduct.. or it's Charter.  For anyone to suggest that the ABC should have a token  Conservative (apart from Amanda Vanstone on Counterpoint) is suggesting that the ABC break its own Charter.... as there are no (as far as we know) openly left-wing political journalists employed at our ABC.

14 Oct 2013 2:09:48pmThe brilliance of a come-back comment from Peter who must actually never watch any of the TV programs he lists.  All have interviewers from the right and extreme right (Akerman, Henderson etc) and all have guests from both sides of politics on an equal basis and an audience in Q & A which always has more Liberals than any other group.  What bias?  If anything it tilts to your 'side'.
Alert moderator
14 Oct 2013 5:08:01pmOlive, if the ABC was tilted to the centre we would all be happy. Unfortunately for all the good journo?s and production staff that work with the ABC and its vast network the left have taken over. True to their ideals (and mainly biases), there is no allowable for dissention from the collective consensus.  Potentially good shows such as Lateline, 7.30 Report , Catalyst, Media Watch and the ABC News have been spoilt by inferior journalism, mainly because the agenda of the left has deliberately ignored the other side of the story.
Alert moderator
15 Oct 2013 8:59:34amFrankly I doubt you could ever distinguish the left from the centre or from the right.  Unless you agree with it it is all far left it seems.  I agree that some of the ABC's journalism the last year or two has not been too good - it was all too soft on all the Liberal pollies during interviews and far too hard on all Labor pollies.
Alert moderator
14 Oct 2013 4:47:13pmGoodness, I don't really know what you listen to or watch, but I certainly am aware of many right wing commentators on all ABC forums, from news and discussion, TV Drum, Q&A, Lateline etc. It seems to me some of you are not satisfied unless ALL the commentators are overtly and far right wing. Middle of the road, or objective reporting is re-defined as "left" when it isn't. I don't always agree with everything I hear, read or see on the ABC, but I am always pleased to have the range of ideas and opinions they present.

14 Oct 2013 10:17:17amAs an LNP voter, I am very pleased with this result.Shorten won the caucus by 26 votes, but lost the rank+file by about 6000, which is a straightforward "One Union Official in Parliament is worth about 250 of the rank+file" calculation.This tells the rank+file plenty about the born to rule mentality of the ALP  bosses. It tells them why the ALP bosses are all multi-millionaires living in massive mansions...while they are not. This state of affairs is described by the ALP as "democratic" etc.There has never been an ALP leader who has ousted an LNP govt....who had had ANY previous experience of governing (ie Whitlam, Hawke, and Rudd). This latest  contemptuous dismissal of the ALP's rank +file dooms the ALP once again to decades of disaster. None of the current crop of ALP MPs will be around to see Tony Abbott handing over, in 2030 (when he breaks the PM longevity record), to one of his daughters...who will then become Australia's first INTELLIGENT and SUCCESSFUL female PM.

None of them want him as leader.Abbott was a useful attack dog in opposition.  He will never be a good Prime Minister.  He is the destructor, not a creator.As for his daughters, I am saddened that politics ropes them into this farce.  I wish them well in whatever they do.

14 Oct 2013 1:23:06pmSmaller election victory? In 2007, Labor won 23 seats with a swing of 5.44%. In 2013, the Coalition won 18 seats with a swing that appears to be around ~2.58%The reason that the result appears to be so big is that in 2007, Rudd was working from a starting (two-party consideration) position of -27 seats, and ended up +18. The Coalition, however, was working from dead even (72 a piece), and appears to be ending up with +35 - since they didn't have to make up a deficit to begin with, any seat won is actually over-represented in their majority.

All legislation needed Liberal or Green approval.  The swing is smaller this time yet the Greens lost about 25% of their primary vote and the ALP had a record low primary vote for any of the ALP politicians life times.  The only winner was Palmer and the independents.

14 Oct 2013 10:55:31amEven though I voted for Albo because I think he would have made the better leader, I'm sure that Shorten will do a fine job as well.  I know it can be hard for the cynical and Liberal Party activists to understand, but it's possible to choose from the better of two good candidates, rather than the least worst of two poor candidates.

14 Oct 2013 11:50:03amScup, in fact it has been a very rewarding time for the ALP. For starters the spotlight has been firmly on Abbott:- No matter how rosy News Ltd tries to paint it - Abbott had to kowtow to Indonesia- Abbott proves to be the master of inappropriate allowance paybacks. It has also bought into question his (so called) charity and volunteering endeavors- With Brandis, Joyce, Bishop et al all as bad as their relentless claims on ALP members or Slipper, the double standards of the born-to-rules are truly breathtaking- No action on budget emergency, token acknowledgement that the economy is no is such a bad state etc. etc. etc.- David Marr's brilliant expose of George Pell in the latest quarterly essay, showing that he is among the nations most evil men - yet one of Abbott's mentors and one who had the strongest backing of JW Howard.All this has allowed the nation to have a little bit of an insight to your great man Abbott.Nothing can undo the mistakes of the ALP and they are now in opposition. If they play the game in the same manner as Abbott did in opposition all I can say is that the exodus we saw in the early period of Howard's reign was nothing compared to the damage coming.Bring it on. Bring it on.PS Dead Man Walking - Mal Brough ;-)Cheers

14 Oct 2013 2:50:19pmInteresting definition of kowtowing to Indonesia.  Abbott apologised for putting "the sugar on the table" (Rudd opening the borders) and the Instant Cattle ban (created by Gillard).  The problem was bias reporting such as the ABC deliberately using the word "tow" when it was never the policy.  The ABC's only real defence on "fact/myth-checker" was that the Liberals did not call them up on it on every occasion.  The Indonesian government, if open to free trade cant stop the bewildering policy of buying boats or information.  I dont like either approach, yet no kowtowing has been performed.  I wish some of it was performed.  ps, where does the ABC get its spell checker from when it dosnt recognise the word "defence"?

14 Oct 2013 12:06:53pmscupundi,"As an opposition they have been missing for what......6weeks?"Are you serious?We have just had seven years of some of the best government we have ever had in this country. We have the strongest economy in the world, whethered the worst of the GFC so well that the press asked "crinsi? what crisis?", and the previous two parliaments delivered an unprecedented amount of nation-building reforms while keeping th ebudget strong and avoiding the terrible disasters befalling Europe and the US. And what did we hear about it from the popular press? Not a word. All we heard was doom and gloom, constant CONFECTED reports of leadership tensions that eventually became reality simply because the press INSISTED on it. (More than one Murdoch journalist has admitted that their brief was to keep up the leadership speculation regardless of any lack of substance).The simple fact that the most democratic and pluralistic leadership race ever undertaken by a major party in Australia has concluded in such a harmoniuous and positive manner has been totally ignored. Instead the press is still protraying the process as some sort of shady backroom deal.Given the current situation, a short hiatus during which the opposition was more than ably led by Chris Bowen did no damage whatsoever and has put Labor in a much stronger position to hold the "government" (how can you call a regime led by a party that hates government a "governemnt"?) to account. Shorten now has UNDENIABLE legitimacy as the leader of the parliamentary party, which is more than you can say for Abbott - who was APPOINTED party leader by the faceless men in News Limited, New York.
Alert moderator
14 Oct 2013 2:54:25pmI have to agree.  Six weeks when parliament hasnt even sat is nothing.  The attacks on the Liberals where loudly said and the media reported it.  And the media is curious as to why the Liberals are performing a media blackout.  An event where the party would want the newsbreakers to portray it positively is turned into a negative.  If Albansese won when 2/3rds of the elected officials believe there is a better leader, that wouldnt make him very legitimate either.  Shorten has considerable support from his peers.  If it is justified or not will take over a year to confirm/deny.  A very similar thing could be said for the current government.

14 Oct 2013 1:56:27pmActually Abbott has been reelected as leader since then with no help from Slipper at all.I think what will be far more interesting is the revelations when Eddie Obeid is charged and tried and we find out just who is in Parliament at a state and federal level due to his patronage.Then you will be able to stand up for the principles you espouse here.

14 Oct 2013 12:57:55pmThe carbon price is an interesting political problem.  Abbott has spent 3 spittle-flecked years ranting against it and has convinced the faithful that it's a bad thing.  But that's just politics with no relationship to reality.Instead, we need to ramp up the carbon price so that coal mines are unprofitable and close down.  Without this we are eating into our global carbon budget.Other countries (for example, France) are introducing a carbon price while our government is trying to remove ours.  Abbott is on the wrong side of history here.Shorten should keep up the pressure on carbon pricing.  Abbott will crack.  And if he doesn't, I will vastly enjoy him failing to win a double-dissolution election.

As an ALP member I loved being involved in the selection of the leader and while I had a preferred candidate it would not have troubled me who won as the process was sound and the candidates were high quality.  It was exhilarating and I anxiously awaited the result because I participated. Your comment about the unions is simply ridiculous.  Unions comprise both right wing and left wing views, depending on the union and depending on the members.  There are many of us who do not belong to a union and have views that are "right wing", "left wing" and centre depending on the issue - which makes discussion and debate at the branch, state and federal level very interesting indeed.

His major mistake, and Gillard's major error too, was in not informing the public, including the ALP membership, just why the change had been necessary and accomplished.  On 7 September Rudd's speech made clear what the members of caucus must have known for years - Rudd is a megalomaniac and party leadership was all about him, not the party nor the country.

14 Oct 2013 10:46:11amExcept that it was NOT a 'credible defense'.Attending a wedding in other than an official capacity is a private affair.Saying that it was related to their job is deliberately obscuring the fact.Slipper=Abbott=Brandis et al. Either prosecute the lot, or drop charges against Slipper.  One or the other.  Anything else is just hypocrisy and the longer the Coalition bangs on about it, the worse it will look in the electorate.

Neither of these alternatives suit him for office.

How about being the big man for charity, then we find out that he has had his snout in the public trough.Maybe I'll try that, go to the Sydney funrun and come tax time, charge my accommodation as a business expense. You know how far that would go ? I'd be up on a fine or worse for fraud.Which is where Abbott and his mates should be right now. Come on ALP, have some balls and take it up to Abbott and his spivvy mates.

14 Oct 2013 11:32:52amI cannot see that attending a wedding of a colleague is a credible charge on the taxpayer. This is clearly not an official duty and the excuses do not stand up to scrutiny. The bold refusal of Mr Abbott yo refund his claims for sporting events show either a complete lack of grasp of the basic rules, or a barefaced greed. Neither of these alternatives suit him for office.

Alert moderator
14 Oct 2013 12:13:03pmAndy. A wedding is without a doubt a private gathering. There is no credible defence that attending a colleagues private wedding is related to the ministerial responsibilities of a member of parliament. Abbott has stated he sees no need to end this waste. It is waste. It is corrupt. It is a breach of trust. There is a pattern of "You can trust us" LNP MP's who believe the taxpayer should fund every aspect of their life. Where is the police? Are they corrupt too? Charges need to be brought against Abbott and his minsters in the name of applying the law with consistency. Abbott is revealing what a complete hypocritical disgrace he and his ministers are and Australians need to say NO to the waste and corruption.
Alert moderator
14 Oct 2013 12:16:11pmYour whole justification hinges on the word "credible".  I'm yet to see how any of these weddings can possibly be seen as a credible justification.As for Mr Abbott charging the taxpayer so he can go out and do his triathlons etc - people don't get to tax deduct their hobbies, so why are we paying Mr Abbott to do so?
Alert moderator
14 Oct 2013 2:05:08pmAlso, people were deceived by believing Abbott donated his own time for these charitable causes.Yet he deliberately deceived the country by claiming it as an expense against the very taxpayers that donated to this cause!!Yep Tony? We can see your compassion??

14 Oct 2013 12:16:39pm" attending weddings where there is at least a credible defense of it being politically related to their job?"So? Andy, what about Iron Man events? Defensible only if such events are held in marginal seats? Could you use you Liberal logic to explain the legitimacy, 'coz I certainly can't see the relevence. Tony is suggesting he needed to go so he could do what, lobby on behalf of the Liberal Party? If that's the case then why didn't the Liberals foot the bill, rather than all taxpayers?Snouts in troughs and so many too blind or partisan to care, as long as the evil ALP are in opposition.

14 Oct 2013 12:52:59pmPretty convenient to try and forget about a $6000 plus book promotion and a $12,000 personal library. This obscene rorting goes way beyond the occasional wedding and to white wash it is not and never will be in the best interests of this country. Open your eyes and look beyond the political divide. Admit that your beloved leaders are money grabbing scum. Paying it back doesn't forgive the original attempt to rob the taxpayer by deception.Oh, by the way..........Volunteer....One who gives FREELY of their time.Charity....

14 Oct 2013 1:00:23pmAndy, no, I don't see the difference, because there is none.Attending a wedding is a personal choice, which derives from a personal invitation. It has nought to do with politics, and it has nought to do with profession.Otherwise, all workers and business-folk would be able to claim wedding expenses from their tax, based on the chance of meeting their colleagues and talking work.And that surely isn't the case.

14 Oct 2013 1:08:37pmAndy, i note with some interest that the 11 labor trolls who answered below never answered the question of slipper going on a tour of the canberra vineyard at the taxpayers expense. it is alledged that he falsified the claims, i also noted that cassidy never even touched the subject,  but that might have been becasue it is subect to criminal prosecution. why have the trolls failed to mention gillard attending a wedding in coff harbour and using the PM jet to attend, its been reported that the wedding was of a personal nature and gillard did not attend the wedding in any offical capacity. But hey, one rule for abbott and another for gillard.

14 Oct 2013 1:25:56pmNo need to - we all know about them and most were rorts.  Most business as a PM is different (and I would include Abbott as PM from now on) - they do do many things in an official capacity and go to places they would never do just as an MP or in a private capacity.  There are few 'trolls' here on the Drum so no need to chuck out that word inappropriately.

14 Oct 2013 5:28:33pmNO credible defence - sorry, getting the taxpayer to pay for social or electioneering events is just not in the rules and never was. Having been in parliament (and government) for so long, they should know better. I haven't yet heard any actual defence from Slipper, but there is a possible one (that's a hell of a lot better than "it was a marginal electorate") which is he was purchasing local wines (And most as only available from the vineyards) for the Speaker's office for entertaining.

14 Oct 2013 9:40:02amThe articulation of further evolutions is most awaited.Remediating the selection of senators through state wide ballots ought to be a priority.The more the opportunities to participate, more will want to participate in a democratic process.Being able to indicate one's position on an issue and then knowing as to whether one's representative voted in that way would allow a more objective assessment of a member and whether they are worthy of a vote. This is not impossible with current technology.Democratisation of Labor now causes Liberals to demonstrate that they really are of the people, not only big trading business.

14 Oct 2013 9:43:17amLet's hope the good will on display through the leadership campaign will continue through the parliamentary term. No reason to expect it won't given Albo's loyal support of Gillard even though he was a declared Rudd supporter.To me Shorten seems lightweight, a bit artificial and rehearsed and inclined to stumble when put on the spot in broadcast interviews. However " image" might be more important in his ability to cut through which is an awful pity. Let's hope that the ALP is as good as its word and really knuckles down to some serious policy work especially on asylum seekers and immigration in general - more compassion , significantly more humanitarian immigration , and better regional cooperation . more support to UNHCR.And let's hope Kevin is fully occupied with overseas meetings and later decides that it's time to go. Bowen was effective as acting leader  but his role in supporting Rudd in the undermining of Gillard is a very black mark. Some of these sons of previous MPs seem to believe they are entitled.The ineteresting thing is that despite the glossy brochures and union dollars for Bill, Albo convincingly won the general membership vote. Perhaps "frugality" is emore effective than "glossy".
Alert moderator
14 Oct 2013 10:34:52amA few overseas meetings will not distract Rudd from his stated aim of being PM again. It will be a pleasure to watch Shorten learn that those that live by the sword shall die by the sword, or in Shorten? s case, the knife.The ALP will continue to fail Australia while they have the filth of Shorten, Albo, Tanya, Wong and Rudd in their ranks.

14 Oct 2013 10:55:10amcg: Agree with most of what you say. Gillard in the main failed because of the Murdoch Press, and Labor's underestimating to what lengths the LNP would go to to win office.The trashing of previous policy, lies and obfuscation, running down the economy, appealing to xenophobia, and character assassination came out of the blue. Added to the LNP's ability to ignore the consequences of the GFC and exaggerate the downside to stimulus programmes really worked a treat on a not too smart public.However the current crop of LNP front bench appear to be like rabbits caught in the spotlight. (Better still like snouts in the trough).Can't wait t until parliament resumes.

Once you understand just how entrenched Shorten's sense of entitlement is, it doesn't seem so strange that he would blow his stack at some poor Asian lady who dared serve him a pie not done just the way Billy-Boy likes. is it?Are there NO decent people ANYWHERE in the ALP?

14 Oct 2013 3:52:22pmBean CounterYes it is funny that none of our ALP supporting friends has actually pointed out that Mr Shorten is a Catholic. It seems that a Coalition Catholic is an evil servant of Opus Dei and Cardinal Pell and will take awya all our rights, but a Labor Catholic (from the party that was traditionally the home of Catholics) is a wonderful, warm human being who will give all poor people lots of dosh.
Alert moderator
14 Oct 2013 6:47:22pmPeter: Shorten gets no marks from me being a Catholic, any more than Rudd did for being a church goer of another denomination.I believe, as most Australians do that we should stringently protect our secularity.If Shorten tries to gain brownie points , as Abbot does, for being a Catholic he will lose me. However I do not think that Shorten will need regular visits to George Pell to correct his moral compass.The other Government front bench "committed" Catholics are also a worry. We should be concerned about out Education Minister.

It too has its faceless men and women-many of who sit in the boardroooms of multi nationals-law firms and financial institutions=the 'elte' one migh say-or those who think they are 'elite'.As for being out of touch with the 21st century= I think the LNP may just shade the ALP in that race. Both are prisoners of the fuedal debt and fossil driven growth economy of the 19th century. Both refuse to accept that that is no longer sustainable=the 21st century belongs to the Third Industrial Revolution of the merging of new communication and renewable energy technologies. A century where households will produce and share their own energy in a collaborative -free and democratic economy.There are no more advocates of class warfare than those who wish to maintain the status quo-the crooks who caused the GFC and the ensuing growing disparity.And there are no more delusional than those who are as rusted on as you appear to be.

14 Oct 2013 9:56:39amBill Shorten did not win because of the glossy leaflets distributed to the members of the ALP, his win was decided by the greater support from caucus. The members of caucus are very unlikely to have been convinced by glossy leaflets.... So, even issue number 3 is not a problem.In short, the new dynamic within the ALP is extremely welcome. More Democracy is always good. Now the Coalition is faced with a united, internally Democratic, energised ALP, riding on their string of successes in the recent Government and with their experienced front bench virtually intact.....

No matter what he says he appears power hungry, and to have no loyalty, the end justifys the means so to speak.And it's early days for Abbott, I never thought he'd be very popular, but people won't forget the Labor mess just yet. Abbott's got plenty of time.

14 Oct 2013 2:39:33pmwhogoesthere.  The difference is the caucus members have to work day to day with the leader and hence the weighting.  It was very close which can only be a good thing for the party.

14 Oct 2013 4:25:36pm"The process has produced the same result as not having the members vote at all."... WRONG! Had the difference in favour of Albanese in the popular vote been larger and the difference in favour of Shorten in the caucus vote been smaller Albanese would have been elected.But never forget, this is a Democratic process within a united team. The actual winner is the Labor Party first and, ultimately, the People of Australia.

14 Oct 2013 10:40:25amHmm, let's review: The man (union hack) who the Unions wanted (and spent a fortune to ensure won), who assasinated two of his own Prime Ministers, is the weakest parliamentary performer of any in his party, was unwanted by a large majority of the party members (who were supposed to 'matter' now) and is now most well known for his 'I don't know what she said but I support it' statement is now leading Labor.

14 Oct 2013 4:32:14pmTony Abbott assassinated Malcolm Turnbull and, with a dagger offered to him by Rupert Murdoch, he assassinated the Australian Democracy. The Unions could have controlled the members vote, but Albanese won that one, so yours is just the usual Union paranoia nonsense. Finally, Kevin Rudd is still there, he was democratically elected (in spite of the delusional wishes of you supporters of the Coalition who dreamt of a Labor PM losing the election and his seat, just like the "lying rodent" Howard). His experience is undeniable, and the Democratic process for the election of the leader was his initiative.

14 Oct 2013 10:48:46am"Experienced Front Bench" ??  Most of them left the Parliament when Rudd was re-anointed.  This predictable result would have happened without the month long naval gazing exercise.  The New Messiah, ex Union Hack, Back Stabber, and with as much charisma as a limp lettuce leaf.  This whole experiment with democracy was a charade, and possibly a done deal, with Albo standing just to make it look like a contest.  Genuine democracy would be to allow the members to have a say in pre-selection of candidates, but this seems a step too far for the Union heirachy.

Although you are correct, the entertainment is certainly about to start, the entertainment of watching Shorten prove to everyone, once and for all, that he has absolutely nothing to offer Australia or the Labor party except more of the same but with his added incompetency and, being at the behest of the 'faceless men' we are sure of some truly spectacular stuff ups while he tries to be everything to everyone but mostly to himself.

14 Oct 2013 7:46:03pmAlpo, Business confidence is turning back to positive, if we can just get the carbon tax and mining tax repeld it will be a massive boost for our biggest employers and give manufacturing a massive jab in the arm also.We didn't need to apply the amount of money out during the GFC,  these so call money managers, Swan, Rudd, Gillard, Wong etc, knew they would have to pay back the borrowing, they just didn't stop the spending though and our issues compounded until September 7.The continual changing of the front bench, the Thomson/Williamson affair, the removal of Harry Jenkins with Peter Slipper and need I say the removal of 2 sitting Prime Ministers, all matters that make the public and private and corporate investors in our country extremely nervous and reluctant to continue growth.Like it or not Alpo, our standard of living has fallen since K Rudd started dishing dollars to everyone and undid our boarder protection, the community has been nervous ever since.Abbotts been in for 5 minutes, give him a chance, he could turn out to be the best Prime Minister we have ever had, he certainly warmed to the opposition role well. I love Australia Alpo and wouldn't live anywhere else.
Alert moderator
14 Oct 2013 9:53:36pmPop, business confidence is up yes, but consumer confidence is not higher than it was at the beginning of the year. Also, don't forget that business confidence is a psychological measure, actual business investment is what gets the economy going. Unemployment remains higher, but stable in the last data, simply because workers have stopped looking for jobs. Swan started to repay the debt, remember, but he was told to stop by business, otherwise the economy would have suffered, hence he accepted to go into deficit. The same will happen with Hockey, and he surely knew it, so his promises of surpluses should qualify as a lie. By the way, our debt is continuing its cumulative growth.... check the Australian Debt Clock that Liberal bloggers here loved so much before the 7th of September but that now they seem to have completely forgotten.... I wonder why. The changes were mainly a response to the destabilising tactics of the right-wing backed Media (although I have always admitted a degree of panic from the part of Labor). Such tactics did affect public opinion, which led to the hung Parliament in 2010, and the totally disgusting escalating strategy of Tony Abbott and his media/business backers during the Gillard Government. Future historians will tell the truth, you can be sure of that. Our economy did continue to grow, by the way, in spite of a pretty disastrous international economic climate. However, our economy is not isolated from the world economy that was affected by the events in the USA, the EU debt, the China slowdown.... you also mentioned the GFC. Our borders were well protected under the Labor Government. The paranoia regarding asylum seekers was mostly scaremongering and hysteria from the Coalition, concocted for political purposes. In fact now they have stopped informing the people about boat arrivals. During the Howard government the number of asylum seekers across the world decreased but, in spite of that, arrivals here started to increase well before 2007. Abbott doesn't deserve any respite, he and his mates in the Media gave none to the ALP.I assure you, we all love this country and want the best for everybody living here. That's why we should nurture our Democracy and defend it against those who want to destroy it with their lies and manipulation. I do hope that the Abbott government falls and that finally the Coalition does that soul cleansing that I hoped they would do had they lost the last election. But they won, and their tactics have been vindicated.... It's a dark period for the country, I am afraid. I hope it will be short.

14 Oct 2013 10:14:44amI see the 'experiment' as a glass half empty analogy. It sure beats the hell out of the rank anf file having NO say but it still leaves the power in the hands of the 'faceless' faction leaders.We shall never know who or what made the 55 caucus members be so out of synch with almost 60% of the rank and file but it seems they are still reluctant to listen to what their own member and the punters at large are saying.I believe many people feel like I do-that Bill Shorten =the driving force behind the Rudd sacking and recall is too politically naive. I mean one would think that an ex union official would have enough sense to know that the 'blokes" would not take too kindly to their PM being-in the their eyes- stabbed in the back by a woman. Which is precisely what what did did feel. Then the man who man who spawned that problem supported KR-who did more to de stabilsie the Gillard Government than Abbott did-and that is saying something.Be-that as it may- Shorten now has the job of calming Albo supporters who I think may rightly feel they have been "duped".The ALP was not exactly forthcoming in clearly explaining just how the 50/50 ballot would work. I was thinking of joining the ALP and wrote to a nearby Labor MP for an explanation- I gave that I though would be the way the system would work-his response was to suggest I contact the State office. I emailed them and got no reponse.At no stage was I told that a caucus vote would be worth some 300 member votes-I saw that on the ABC-a day after the caucus vote.I did not and will not join the ALP. However a glass half full is certainly a lot better than an empty one and after listening the Minister Greg Hunt this morning going on about the honour and values of the Coalition (the man is delusional) the ALP glass is certainly more transparent that that of the LNP.

14 Oct 2013 10:15:59amPeter its hard to see how labor members could think they were the real winners in this new system and its hard to see any Australian feels Labors new system is democratic.The real winners with the a system that allows 67 votes to cancel out 18000 would be the faceless men who maintain their power and the coalition who can continue to exploit this real weakness in the labor brand. The system needed to change for the labor members to feel they have power but the party will remain a shadow of the great workers party of the last century this is not the labor party I once voted for as a younger man.

14 Oct 2013 1:07:18pmSo if the Liberal party had a similar system to choose their leader, do you think Abbott would be leader today?He was despised by the vast majority of voters and probably still is, after the rorting revelations. He gained the Liberal leadership with the vote of his best friend Pete Slipper.His approval rating was at rock bottom then and we await with bated breath for the next poll now.Cant wait!

14 Oct 2013 4:22:12pmBut Abbott is PM and will remain so for a long time yet.The xpenses thing cuts both ways.Abbott was actually voted in twice since his initial election as leader of the Liberal Party.  Both times the vote was unanimous.  Abbott's popularity with the electorate isn't important. What is more important is the popularity of the Government at election time.  Already the boats are stopping, Indonesia is being co-operative and business is regaining the confidence it lost under Labor.  Only 6 weeks have gone by, and everyone I talk to is just happy that the adults are back in power and that sensationalist ALP hacks are not domianting the airways with their endless spin and thought bubbles.

14 Oct 2013 10:16:10amAs much as it's unfashionable to agree with Mark Latham, his criticisms of Albanese relating to his lack of political judgement were pointedly accurate. On the Ian MacDonald stuff alone it was not worth making Albo leader.The party members who backed Albo in significant numbers recognised his capacity for communication and his established reputation as a bit of a lefty. They probably weren't thinking about what the Liberals would have done with his relationships with some controversial characters in NSW Labor.The right decision was made for the right reasons and the new method of selecting a leader, while open to improvement, has held up.

14 Oct 2013 12:38:42pmThe Liberals aren't as desparate as the torn apart Labor Party. Although you seem to possess a dodgey crystal ball, your suggestion that if the successful Liberals were to follow the failed Labor Party then you, and you alone, can foresee a result that is as far-fetched as any rusted on luvvie from the ALP could ever conjur up.The reason the ALP sought intervention by party members is because the ALP recognise that ALP caucus members (caucus, pronounced core cus - with an emphasis on the cussing)  couldn't be trusted to vote for a leader on their own.The ALP were a joke over the past six years, even moreso over the past three and a half years. Today, nothing has change.

14 Oct 2013 10:21:32amIf the ALP really wants to be democratic, as distinct from wanting to seem democratic, it could consider giving branch members a deciding vote on who becomes their local member.

It may have been the Democrats who suggested making this compulsory for all political parties.  I think it's a great idea.   I was a member of one such safe seat.  I responded to a deluge of requests for help with envelope stuffing by saying I would happily help if the member would commit to facing preselection from the local branch before standing again.

Anyway if Bill doesn't work out Kevin from Queensland will still be there to "help ". The current Labor party has a long way to go before it finds " it's way " again.

14 Oct 2013 10:46:05amNo matter how many wonderful wrappings you put on a rubbish - it remains rubbish. No matter how many wonderful excuses some try to put on the recent Labor leadership election - it remains a disaster. As a member of the Labor Party who voted for Anthony Albanese, I can l tell you that the whole 'democratic process' was nothing short of a disaster. Membership will not be happy that even 60% of the members' vote, still makes no difference to the selection of the Party Leader. It is 'business as usual'. Power brokers pretend to give 'the suckers' some power sharing and then do whatever you want. I ask you: "How can the 'parliamentary wing' of the Labor Party be so out of touch with its own membership?" Perhaps because the majority of the Labor's 'Parliamentary wing'  was never voted in by the Party membership, but 'installed' by the same powerbrokers. That is the main problem with the ALP. The current leadership election exposed it so clearly.
Alert moderator
14 Oct 2013 12:42:59pmIt is actually the Labor Party membership who is out of touch with the Australian mainstream. Labor Party is electorally competitive only because the Labor parliamentary party ignores the extreme left policies supported by the membership. The membership elections can only move the party towards the policies of the extreme left which would never be supported by the majority of Australians. Such Labor would never be electorally copetetive and would virtually ensure the conservative domination of the Australian government. That surely would not be healthy for our democracy. That is the real danger of the Labor's 'new democreatic' Leadership elections.

14 Oct 2013 2:31:28pmSoooo right Sarah. Labor MPs have to look after their jobs that is why they have to 'modify' some of the Labor policies to make them acceptable to the wider community. The Labor membership have no such worries. They can thus afford to parade the purity of their ideology.

14 Oct 2013 4:31:33pmI would have thought that if the ALP members had been given a real say in the selection of MPs, then they wouldn't need a say in the selction of the Leader of those MPs.
Alert moderator
14 Oct 2013 10:46:29amI think the vote should have been weighted 60/40 in favour of the membership vote as this would correct the right wing bias in the caucus selection process.  The caucus vote for Shorten just highlights the right wing domination of the appointment processes for MP's and Senators and until such time as the right/left balance is equalled out the right wing will be able to dominate the selection process by cancelling out the membership vote.But still, this is a much fairer and open process and should be extended by the ALP to all State and Federal selections for parliamentary and party positions.

Had the leader been elected by the parliament, Bill Shorten could have claimed and overwhelming support - two thirds - majority. The membership participation exposed him unpopular even with Labor membership. Some Labor spin doctor still try to  tell us that the election "empowered" the membership.

Alert moderator
14 Oct 2013 11:05:10amThanks for an even handed attempt to weigh up  the pros and cons. I don't doubt that the intelligent and articulate Shorten will be an effective opposition leader. My main issue with him is that the factions which he has worked very persistently for many years to control on a quid pro quo basis, will be in charge when Labor is re-elected.Since the unions provide most of Labor's finances many might have no problem with this. But Labor is not just about unions and their officials. It now is or should be, about much more than that. Another problem I have with Shorten is his questionable behaviour described in Aaron Patrick's "Downfall". As Patrick points out towards the end of the book, it was not Rudd or Gillard (or Shorten) who exposed the extensive corruption within the HSU and elsewhere in NSW Labor. It is simply not credible that somebody as powerful as Shorten had no idea of former party president Michael Williamson's activities or the way he ran the HSU as his personal fiefdom. "The win at any cost culture of Labor's factions allowed dubious characters like Obeid, Macdonald, Williamson and Thomson to remain in privileged positions far too long". Shorten has been very successful at controlling his urbane, "big voice for the little bloke" public image but the reality is a bit different. ABC  radio has done its bit there as well, this morning describing Bill as "the son of a waterfront worker and a union official". This is true but is far from the full story. For example, he is also a product of an exclusive Melbourne catholic school, equivalent to Abbott's Riverview. He is an extremely ambitious, totally ruthless career politician who has spent virtually his entire adult life working the factions. I urge all those who would like to know a bit more about Shorten to read Aaron Patrick's book.Have a good one.

14 Oct 2013 11:07:20amPeter, one must congratulate Bill Shorten for coming on top. But having said that nothing much has changed, the very fact that the majority of the ALP base is left-wing & its leadership is right-wing is a real problem, the politics are like cheese & chalk. And unless the ALP changes its platform on a number of fronts ie asylum seekers I fail to see how the party can call its self a progressive party.

14 Oct 2013 11:10:42amShorten should have gone to the wilderness. What is important is what the greater Australian public will make of Bill Shorten as Opposition Leader. He'll need immense skill to change the publics' image of him, particularly since he will not have an incredible marketing team, "The Australian" and shock jocks to help him like Mr Abbott did.I think Mr Shorten will be a caretaker leader if he cannot significantly close the polls results within 12 months. Overall, I tend to think the vote of the ALP grass roots  which did not favour Mr Shorten will reflect  the wider Australian public opinion.

14 Oct 2013 11:38:51amThe Shorten win shows a disloyal Minister is rewarded with the leadership with tenure rules afforded him on different terms than those he white-anted his predecessors.  By the Parliamentary members voting before the wil of the rank-and-file is announced, it fails to hold the parliamentary members from accountability in considering the input of the rank-and-file before casting their vote for the Leader e.g. defying 60% of the rank-and-file's vote for Albanese. To her credit, Tanya P was prepared to be transparent even at risk of losing the Deputy Leader's job offered to her for gender balance (telling of Shorten sincerityas Right Leader should be critical of the Coalition's Cabinet for only having one female Cabinet member when the Right's ONLY female relatively senior ex-Minister is Kate Ellis) by publicly backing Albanese. As only one ALP Opposition Leader has survived a whole term in 25 years, Tanya may be the next Labor PM (remember the rank-and-file do not vote if there is only ne nominee) and, being in the electorate of Sydney with a substantial Greens vote, wil be inclined to negotiate a deal with the Greens to gain power in her minority Government (back to the future!).

14 Oct 2013 12:28:20pmPeter Chen's anti-Labor bias is expressed in his damnation with faint praise of the new ALP leadership ballot process.Claim one: that the new rules  make the party (not all parties,just the ALP so not "parties" please Peter) more democratic.Peter attempts to diminish the achievement by categorising the increased democratic process as only "to some extent". It's either an increase or not. I call it an increase.It does respond to the Bracks/Faulkner/Carr review but that's a good action and shouldn't be demeaned because somebody thought of it before Mr Rudd. Yes, it "is not likely to drive membership" but that was never its main emphasis. If it does so, that's a good. It achieves its main objective, to secure the leadership position and decreases party leadership instability. The past several years have shown that to be a worthy aim in itself, whatever the membership numbers do. I guesstimate they're not likely to fall as a result of this review.Chen then attempts to promote just such instability by attempting to undermine Mr Shorten's leadership authority on the basis that he has "only" achieved a combined total of 52% instead of 63%. It's a majority, Peter, of the combined votes of both Caucus and the membership. It's not 100%, it's not 75% it's 52% but it's a decisive majority when the high quality of both candidates is taken into consideration.Claim two: that the "extended" month-long process will detract from the effectiveness of the opposition. As Peter admits, this has not been the case but he takes the opportunity in passing to sink the boot into Mark Dreyfus. My point is that a single month is immaterial. The German elections were decided in late September and a working government still hasn't been formed because of the negotiations taking place with the smaller parties. The governance of Germany is still ticking along quite happily. The economy hasn't failed, there are no riots in the streets. The Germans are a mature electorate and understand that arranging a multi-party coalition will take time. The bureaucracy will keep things operating until a new policy direction is decided. That's what bureaucracies are FOR, Peter. We Australians can take a lesson from that. Instant results aren't automatically better results.Claim Three: that leadership campaigns will "Americanise" ALP politics.Peter raises the non-existent bogeyman of the party candidates becoming beholden to large campaign donors. This completely ignores that our laws not only restrict he quantum of political donations but also that ALP rules require that all donations are made to the party, not to individual candidates.All in all, I'm less than impressed with the article which purports to be an analysis. I've always understood genuine analyses to be unbiased, but this

15 Oct 2013 8:01:28amI disagree completely, Waterloo. In the context of our discussion, it was the ALP government which set the urgent and immediate POLICY for the PubServ to implement. Without a government policy in place, the PubServ would not (and could not) have exercised its own initiative to deal with he crisis.A different government (possibly a Coalition one) which relied on only the status quo and its own reputation, issued no urgent and immediate policy instructions (start the cash splash, the BER, the pink batts & guarantee bank deposits) would have had an increasingly nervous and cautious community (squirrelling away its dollars under the floorboards), a contracting building sector and a downward economic spiral. As it was, we were all reassured that there was a steady hand at the economic wheel and the economy stayed buoyant - best in the world!It was probably the most intelligent and well-executed GFC counter which could have been made and confirmed the ALP under Rudd & Swan as GREAT economic managers. It has set a very high standard for the Coalition government to maintain, but with Abbott, Robb and Hockey running the show, I'm already nervous about the future.

There's a few things glossed over, not the least of course is that the Labor Caucus (in this case) seems to by way of weighted numbers got its way in any case. Then of course the facts are that "Shorten" is a proven snake, and will be (in typical Shorten fashion) sneak around behind closed doors leaning on his Union buddies in a manner not unlike the "faceless men" fiasco. Then look at the tired and miserable lot left he has to work with, only the "safe labor" seat survivers left and most tainted with the Gillard or Rudd scouge who couldn't be trusted in any case. Albanese at least proved he could manage Government Business, but my observations of Shorten combating the then opposition was that he was found wanting on every occasion. So good luck with that Labor, not a lot has changed and the Parties fortunes will of course be left to the Polls and the spin Doctors.

14 Oct 2013 12:58:16pmA bit OT but I would be fascinated to know how many posters here are in a union?  They speak with such authority on the "lefties" in unions.  If Bill Shorten is a conservative and Albo a progressive then that proves the fact that people of all political persuasions can be union members.  I seem to recall Tony Abbott taking part in industrial action as a journo?  Just because a person belongs to a union in no way predicts their vote nor their political sympathies.  Just get it right, yeah?  It?s like saying conservatives are all money-centric, heartless fascists.  The level of debate will never elevate a long as these galloping assumptions exist about political determinism.

14 Oct 2013 1:49:40pmWhen critics talk about "lefties" in unions, they (inc. me) are, in my estimation, generally talking about the loud/reckless/foolish ones amongst them. I think it's fair to say that the criticism is on the mark when it's aimed at such.No doubt there are plenty of quiet lefties too, probably capable of more sober reflection that are being unfairly characterised. They should, at the right time, do themselves some justice and make their true views known. It'll automatically separate themselves from the aforementioned, more extreme "Lefties". When they do that, the country overall wins.

14 Oct 2013 12:59:33pmI don't know about 'winner' exactly but this is certainly good news for Kevin Rudd.  He did owe a modicum of loyalty to Albo for having stuck by him throughout his exile from the leadership (2010-2013).  He owes Shorten nothing.  In the event of a double dissolution and the inevitable Labour loss - if it's an honourable loss then most likely B.S. (has anyone else noticed the initials - they'll be used against him) will be returned as Labour leader.  But even if it's Albo or even someone else, then the leaks will start, probably aided by Murdoch polls about who's the preferred opposition leader (something they never did re the previous opposition of course).  This will pave the way for RK to  'reluctantly' allow himself once again to be 'drafted' to rescue the party he loved enough to trash.  I realise this hypothesis is replete with 'what if' and 'just suppose' but such is the stuff of politics.  One certainty is that KR will never give up his ego driven delusion that he is destined to lead the nation once more.  That he was revealed as a total waste of space will be lost on enough 'save the furniture' time servers in the ALP to bring him back.  Shorten makes all this easier for him but Albo wouldn't have been immune either.  It just might have taken longer.

They don't care and they don't care because we don't push them and let them know who's in charge.Cynical here but in the end they represent us the punters and if we let them get away with it ,then we are to blame.As for the ALP you can see the Lib ads now re Shorten'Can you trust this man? Two ALP leaders couldn't. The ALP will surely never learn. Goodbye, adieu, au revoir and guden nacht.

14 Oct 2013 1:15:35pmMy hopes for Shorten, have been dashed already with his nonsensical proclamation that because he will choose more women, he will be able to govern more effectively than The CoalitionEveryone is for more women in cabinet - if they want to do the job - and are able. however to laud it as a way to run Australia, seems rather vacuous, populist and paltry.Also, it's obvious that in the new information available about increases GW, the carbon tax is useless. And, further was voted against, in the recent election. He should accept that and come up with some physical remedial measures, instead of flogging a dead horse.

14 Oct 2013 1:15:48pmThe real test of party reforms in any political party in any country at the moment is whether the reforms allow a party to consider such matters as:1, Whether a nation state is a suitable political unit for human populations;2, whether a material value system is a suitable one for the  animal Homo sapiens which has twin major survival mechanisms of an intellect and a social nature - whether a knowledge value system wouldn't be more appropriate;3, whether it is sensible to decide on who governs by a vote ofan electorate, most of whom are far too ignorant, biased and stupid to be able to form a rational opinion on most important matters facing the species.4. Whether it isn't time to ditch both Croesus' money and Adam Smith's beatification of greed.It is very difficult to see how any of the present national governments of whatever kind and of whichever persuasion can sensibly assess much less sensibly deal with the monumental problems which loom in front of us.At least Bill Shorten had the good sense to use the word "science" appropriately.  That puts him light years ahead of the person who referred to a very real and very pressing problem as a "heap of crap"However at the moment we are reduced to clutching at such tiny straws.The electorate can be informed. (Even Mr Hunt has picked up the point about acidification of the oceans!)The electorate can come to understand that we don't have a human option but to fund the material welfare of another billion people. I hope that Shorten and Co make a start. There's a helluva lot to do.  It's a disaster that we've come to a shuddering halt while the bean counters sit on their mats counting beans, the monarchists assume a suitable fawning position, and the power crazies rush about attacking demented bikies.

14 Oct 2013 4:55:53pmThe problem for you is that you put government at the centre of human life.  it isn't.  Most of us don't really care, as long as the government just butts out of our lives and lets us get on with our lives.  It is only the greedy statists who love to boss other about who want the reforms for which you pine.Why not let people just get on with life.  When thhey do that, the mosrt extraordinary things develop.  Capitalism has solved the problems of hunger and eradicated disease in the first world. It is the lack of cpaiutalism and the rule of law in the third world which holds it back.The biggest problem for your world view is that you don't understand that neither life nor the economy is a zero sum game.  The achievement of one person doesn't mean that someone else has issed out.  if the market is working, all will benefit from the achievements of the few. People can continue to find new ways of adding value and thereby help the economy to grow. That is the true joy of life, not the restrictions of freedom and enterprise that the envious lefties want to impose upon us.

14 Oct 2013 1:17:18pmLabor has taken one giant step towards democracy. Of course one step is not enough. It never is, never has been and never will be. However when exploring territory previously unknown and untried since the days of ancient Greece, slow cautious steps are probably the best even if they result, as in the election of Shorten as Labor leader, in the failure of the rank and file choice.How to properly empower the rank and file members is probably not the greatest problem because it could sort itself out if enough new members join the party and start making demands. The problem of the role of the unions could be more serious and deserves more attention. I would like to see more discussion about that. One possible solution that occurs to me is to democratize the unions as well by giving more power to the rank and file members.  Any suggestions about how to do that?

14 Oct 2013 1:21:39pmThe Labor Caucus decision to back Shorten suggests it hasn't learned a thing in the last four years.Any changes the party has made are truly only skin deep.The great benefit of giving the rank-and-file membership a say is that they are far likelier to reflect broader voting sentiment. But it only works if you listen.    Shorten is tainted, weak and lacks charisma.  Far from a new Labor, Shorten presents as more of the same: factions, backroom deals and union sway. Shame on the Caucus!I'm throwing my membership in the bin!
Alert moderator
14 Oct 2013 1:32:49pmMy guess is that Bill Shorten had to get the nod because he presents better on TV and radio and he looks better visually. It would be nice to get a gender breakdown of the voting pattern for the two ALP candidates.I am afraid that I am getting too cynical in my advancing years and politics has come down to appearance and charisma. Shorten has both and Albanese has neither. The right wing/left wing divide appears to have no place and it was this divide that seemed to drive Australian politics for so long.Its right wing crap from both sides; RIP environment.
Alert moderator
14 Oct 2013 2:27:14pmWaddya mean?  Shorten does not present better than Albanese on TV. Of course I have to admit that I made the same mistake before watching the Shorten Albanese debate.  That changed my mind. Shorten came off as a typical polished politician.  Albanese displayed real character and charisma of the kind that I have not seen on the political stage since the Hawk era. In fact he reminds me of Hawk.  And even on looks I think Albanese wins out. He is taller than Shorten, his shoulders are boarder. He looks healthier and stronger and much more approachable, much more like father of the nation material.  Of course, all the above are superficial characterizations but that is what usually wins votes.

14 Oct 2013 1:40:16pmThe problem with this process will become evident when the caucus wants to dump a leader who is not performing. 60% of the caucus can request a spill but if after a month of campaigning with an alternative leader trying to demonise the incumbent, the rank and file vote in favour of the current leader the result will be chaos. The opposing party will have a field day during the process and afterwards the re-elected leader (and the world) will know that he or she does not have the backing of his colleagues. Mass cabinet resignations are likely to follow and the leader will be left to limp on. (This would be bad enough in opposition but in government it could be catastrophic for the country.)This scenario is not far fetched. I can well imagine it having occurred at the end of Rudd mark 1. The only time a full party election can occur is when the previous leader resigns or agrees not to re-contest after being challenged by the caucus.

14 Oct 2013 1:40:55pmI'm reminded of Winston Churchill's famous comment that democracy is a terrible system, its only virtue being it's better than all the other systems. By the same token, Labor's new system is flawed, but its still better then the methods that its rivals use.  I suspect it will take the Coalition a few years, perhaps a worse than expected election result next time around perhaps, and they will adopt some variation of Labor's system and, of course, promptly claim it as their own innovation.

14 Oct 2013 2:04:00pmLooking at the comments under this article, it seems that many Laborites think Tony Abbott is already crumbling and the LNP is going to be a one term government. Perhaps we should add to the above article that the ALP's new process of electing a leader has over-inflated the confidence of its supporters. The ALP have just elected another right wing factional, union hack - the type who was primarily responsible for the dysfunction and corruption in the party over the last 6 years. And now they think the ALP will be an effective opposition and credible alternative to the government. Under Bill Shorton (brains), it will be business as usual for the ALP. His election proves that Labor's caucus is completely decadent and out of touch with not only the members of the ALP but the Australian people at large. It will take 2, maybe 3 terms in opposition to purge the party of its right-wing morons and find a leader with some fresh ideas.
Alert moderator
14 Oct 2013 2:11:17pmThe effect of the new rules is simple: the factional bosses get more power. Why?Because to win the leadership of the ALP, you manipulate the smallest of the two equally weighted voting colleges, the ALP caucus in this case, by telling all members of caucus if we want to control our own destiny we make the rank and file vote irrelevant by supporting one candidate with an overwhelming majority.Just as happened with Shorten vs Albanese.Just as will happen with all future votes for ALP Leader.It is a farce, and will have the opposite of the intended effect, i.e., Rudd's declared intent to `smash the power of the factions.'What a joke ...So glad these people are out of government and look like being out of government for a generation.

14 Oct 2013 5:16:13pmThis is a good article about a party not afraid of reform, not afraid of democratic process.  The way ahead will be punctuated by news bites from journalists giving oxygen to Labor dissenters. At the moment the attention given to the Labor leadership ballott is taking the heat off the Abbott government, a government in need of some distraction from the issue of rorting.The key institutional question we need to return to, is questions why the 'bad apples' rorting their entitlements got to such positions of power and were tempted to abuse that power for their own financial gain.  Political institutions are fertile ground for temptations and opportunities for dare we say 'corruption' and as we can see with the Liberal National Party they tend to promote those who have given in to those temptations.  We need to remember that Peter Slipper was a member of the Liberal Party giving weight to an argument that the Liberal Party problems of abusing entitlements are essentially institutional.Any new changes to entitlement rules will be ineffective if not supported by the values of those in power and in the position to abuse them.  Opportunities and temptations for corrupt and unethical behaviour by this government might just become the norm if they do not reform in areas of ethics and integrity.

14 Oct 2013 7:36:17pm@ gnome, yes the book does describe Shorten's successful self-insertion into Sercombe's safe seat of Maribyrnong, but perhaps even more interesting were Shorten's incredibly persistent attempts to "kill" Kathy Jackson's account of his alleged bullying tactics in the preselection of the 2007 Coragamite candidate. (Jackson wanted Cheesman, he wanted Peter McMullin) Patrick also describes the "Short-Con alliance" and so we now see Conroy front and centre. Doug Cameron's daughter Fiona worked for seven years in Ian Macdonald's office according to the book. Cameron argued against Luke Foley's ?prescient? desire to dump Macdonald. Also fascinating is the way Shorten managed the fall out of the HSU debacle and his appointment of Michael Moore as administrator. Aaron Patrick is a former ALP member and was a member of Bill Shorten's Young Labor group. He is, or was when he wrote the book, an editor at the (Fairfax) AFR. I bought two extra copies of Patrick's book as gifts after lending mine, because my friends wanted their own copies! It is absolutely packed with political information and very thoroughly researched. Have a good one.

14 Oct 2013 8:39:52pmI forgot to mention earlier the odd contrast between Paul Howes' and Bill Shorten's approach in how to respond to corrupt union officials. This substantial difference was reported in the AFR on 8/7/13. Howes is happy to go along with Abbott's intention to bring penalties for any such union crooks into line with dishonest company CEOs, (Up to five years jail and up to $340K fines) but Shorten claims that to do so would be "scapegoating unions". As a former union member myself, I think that's total B.S. Why shouldn't union officials who rip off their members suffer identical penalties to dodgy company bosses? Shorten's approach is limited to: "NO criminal penalties and a maximum $10,200 fine for individuals and $51K for organisations. Now why would Bill disagree so strongly with the national secreatary of the AWU? Is Paul Howes really a union basher?Have a good one.

14 Oct 2013 10:09:38pmIt's a hopeless quagmire.  What seemed at first like a democratic advance has problems.  It should be that the broader party members have 100% of the weighting, not just 50%.  The caucus should be the body that makes decision later after a leadership team is in place.  Kevin Rudd was popular among common voters even if the caucus didn't like him.  What does labor do, have a leadership the people want, or that the caucus/powerbrokers want?  It's like a split, a dichotomy.  Incredible to think isn't it, that often the heavyweights just don't think like the broader electorate of voting public.  Yet this whole shamozzle is showing us just that.  The powers in the unions, other big donors, and career politicians are really out of step with community expectations/dreams.  They think OPPOSITE to what the common folk want.  Look at the NRMA.  They send out the ballot to any and all members who care to post back their choice for the motoring body.  Why can't the ALP try something like that?  We don't have to have primaries like the Americans do.  There are plenty of other options.    Another thing, I think people are really sick and tired of hearing about left and right factions in the party.  They have to get their act together and think as a whole, to firm their policy stances and then stick to them.  None of this wavering in blocks that are stabbing each other in the back with dissenting views.  If the Unions are the problem, detach from them entirely.  Union membership is dreadfully low.  Let the unions make their own "union party" which I'm sure would be a very minor political party indeed.

14 Oct 2013 10:12:52pmSome leaders would make a better prime minister than an opposition leader Mr Shorten has compassion , ability , is softly spoken , placid  which often helps keep a prime minister popular because a behind- the- scene prime minister usually has a longer political life than a leader always seen in the spotlight as a one man band  but as an opposition leader does he have the aggressive and noisy personality where scare mongering  tactics are used to discredit a government which have been used by opposition leaders in the past so the public starts to think everything is totally wrong with the government ?

(Only chemical answers please - not mindless political bleats).I also believe that production of fruit trees and other crops well be seriously deleteriously affected by increasingly extreme climatic conditions resulting from increasing greenhouse gasses trapping increasing amounts of heat energy attempting to leave the earth.(Sensible rebuttals must be along the lines of "No.  Apples pears, peaches, plums, cherries, grapes and figs just love periods of high temperature in the middle of winter and the failure of your fruit crops is because you failed to sacrifice to Ceres and Pan and those heathens of wheat farmers forgot to sacrifice to Pater Pluvius - or Heat radiation traverses an atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide and/or methane just as facilely as one with out them.  Please eschew the political abuse).In short I have very good reasons for believing that we are heading for a world experiencing mass starvation, disease epidemics of unimaginable proportions, total collapse of national and international economic systems and intra and international conflicts which our political systems are almost totally inadequate to deal with.The land of Goethe became the land of the Nazis. When it suited them Fraser and the Queen's representative tore up the votes of Australians.Massive political reform in Australia and throughout the world is beyond urgent.

15 Oct 2013 9:29:47amI believe the ALP leadership contest delivered everything it could.  The parliamentary party turned their backs on the 24 hour news cycle and spent a brief moment (in the overall scheme of things) concentrating on their membership.  Like him of loathe him, the general public now can concentrate on an alternative prime minister with confidence that they have the support of their party and will be there until after the next election.More interesting has been how the Abbott administration have used their moment of glory.  With no opponent to belittle they have fallen for the oldest trick in the book, fouling their own nest.We now have 'clean' leader of the opposition facing a PM that has dunked his snout into the  trough on more than one occasion.  Who, in their right mind, would have thought flying around Australia to promote his book "Battlelines" was an expense the taxpayer should fund?  The United States is the only country in the developed world that socializes costs and privatizes profits.And as for his Pollie Peddle, why should taxpayers fund a  middle aged man in lycra getting his rocks off cycling through regional townships that have probably never seen an alternative PM?  After such an unsightly spectacle, I'm sure they wish they hadn't.We need a leader that can run a country, rather than struggle through a midlife crisis.
