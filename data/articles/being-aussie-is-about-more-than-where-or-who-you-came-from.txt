In an immigrant nation like Australia, our Australianness isn't and shouldn't be determined by any one aspect of our identity, least of all where we or our parents "really" came from, writes Sunil Badami."First Waleed, then Sadiq ... now me! Who knew there were so many Muslim winners?" joked actor and author Osamah Sami as he received a NSW Premier's Literary Award this week for Good Muslim Boy, which tells of how he came to Australia and became Australian.Waleed Aly's landmark Gold Logie win was followed by the election of Sadiq Khan as the first Muslim lord mayor of London with the largest individual mandate in British political history. He will lead a constituency of 8.6 million people - larger than many European countries.Born in London to Pakistani immigrants, Khan fought a bitter campaign against Conservative Zach Goldsmith, of the famous banking family, who contentiously made a feature of Khan's ethnicity and faith (despite the fact his own nephews are Muslim - the sons of his sister Jemima and her former husband, Imran Khan).But while Sadiq Khan is London's first Muslim lord mayor, he's not its first lord mayor of Muslim heritage or background. That title goes to the man he took over from, conservative establishment stalwart Boris Johnson. That's right: the posh, blond Johnson's WASPish family name was originally Kemal. His British-born grandfather, Osman Kemal, the son of the Turkish poet, politician and exile Ali Kemal Bey, changed his name to Wilfred Johnson before marrying into the British establishment, in the same way Joe Hockey's Palestinian-born Armenian father Richard changed the family name from Hokeidonian to a more Anglicised surname.While many of us would be delighted to discover intriguing details about our ancestry, offering us new and richer ideas of where we may have come from and how we may have become who we are now, there are many stories of how xenophobic politicians have been revealed to have the same DNA as the very people they demonise and resent the most.American white supremacist Craig Cobb was revealed on television to have 14 per cent African ancestry. One Nation founder Pauline Hanson was revealed to be of 9 per cent Middle Eastern origin.And, while it's never been conclusively established, it's been suggested that Alois Schickelgruber, the father of Adolf Hitler - Nazi Germany's Austrian-born fuehrer - was himself the illegitimate offspring of his mother's liaison with the son of her Jewish employer, with research suggesting Hitler may have had distinctively Jewish DNA, which is probably why he exempted Jesus Christ and himself from the Nuremberg race laws' definition of Jewishness.And many Australians have, in the past, striven to hide their convict, Indigenous or multiracial heritages. Bestselling Indigenous author Sally Morgan grew up thinking she was Indian. Real estate tycoon LJ Hooker was born Lesley Tingyou.We are the sum of many different people. After all, if you looked far enough into your family tree, you'd find thousands - if not millions - of ancestors. While, unlike these examples, Johnson has been open about his Turkish ancestry and has reportedly kept in touch with the Turkish side of his family - even lobbying in 2006 for Turkey to be admitted to the very European Union he's now calling for Britain to exit - both he and Khan are exemplars not only of how quickly and powerfully immigrants can integrate and contribute to the countries and societies they make home, but also of how contentious the idea of any fixed identity can be, especially one centred on any particular aspect of our identity, whether our religion, race or gender or anything else.It isn't all black and white. We all have many facets to our identities - from what work we do to what experiences we've had, from where we live to who we associate with - and we're different people in those different contexts, whether as a boss or employee, parent or child, émigré or citizen.And we are the sum of many different people. After all, if you looked far enough into your family tree, you'd find thousands - if not millions - of ancestors, and while many of us may have no idea who our ancestors might have been or where they may have come from, eventually, you'd find all of us came from the same place.As another Premier's Literary Award winner, Magda Szubanski - whose powerful memoir Reckoning confronts the painful legacy of her Polish father's refusal to discuss his past - noted, in this multinational, globalised world - and especially in Australia - where many of us have "come across the seas" and moved beyond borders, identity is increasingly complex, multifaceted and fluid.And with about half of us born overseas or the children of immigrant parents many, such as my own family, are the product of two or more cultures. My children have an Indian grandmother and a Chinese-Australian grandmother whose Australian family history goes back further than their Anglo grandfather's.As the Prime Minister has rightly pointed out:None of us can look in the mirror and say: "All Australians look like me." Australians look like every race, like every culture, like every ethnic group in the world.So what does it mean to be Australian? Who gets to decide who we should be, and why do they presume they can decide for us? Why should who we think we are be determined on anyone else's terms but our own? Why do we have to choose between one part of ourselves or any other? Why can't we all have the same freedom to decide for ourselves who we are, in the same way we enjoy the freedom to follow any religion we wish?Our Australianness isn't and shouldn't be determined by any one aspect of our identity. Our identity, like the nebulous notion of "authenticity", isn't something that can be dictated by anyone else (as Andrew Bolt has done).If anything, and especially in an immigrant nation like Australia, our Australianness isn't and shouldn't be determined by any one aspect of our identity, least of all where we or our parents "really" came from.Rather, it's an idea - or many different ideas - of what it might mean to be Australian, acknowledging where and who we are now, as much as where we've come from or where we hope to go. And such ideas, like any nation or idea of national identity, can only be enriched by discussing and questioning them, rather than being limited by any particular definition.And not only by accepting the multitudinous complexities of our many different identities, but embracing and celebrating them, rather than suppressing them or being forced to choose in a false dichotomy that not only ignores that complexity but supposes some kind of opposition between them.In his powerful address at the NSW Premier's Literary Awards ceremony, incoming Sydney Festival director Wesley Enoch talked about how his own storied family heritage - Indigenous, Filipino, Spanish, Pacific Islander, British and more - was a reflection of "the vast array of Australian cultures". He added:Like this country, my family is not a neatly divided and shelved experience ... and like this country, it is impossible to separate out or deny any part of that genealogical history, for to deny any one aspect is to invite a deep self-loathing and external hatred of the thing one fears within oneself. The kind of self-denial that, if pursued, can only create instability and self-harm. We are the sum of all these parts and inheritors of myriad ways of living.While some continue to deny their heritage - such as Cobb, who called his DNA results "statistical noise" - and even though Hanson, according to reports, was flustered by her DNA results, referring to "rape and pillage" and saying that "all I can think of is that probably down the track it eventuated from some war" she added that "I'm not going to knock it. It has made me who I am ... just because I might have 9 per cent Middle Eastern in me - this girl here is 100 per cent Australian."As I am, as are Enoch, Szubanski and Sami, as are my girls, and as are all of us who call ourselves Aussie, regardless of wherever - or whoever - we may have come from.Sunil Badami is a writer, broadcaster and performer.

If you want to twist it around to suit yourself, then that's your business.  Keep it to yourself because if you're not born in Australia then you're not the product of Australia which means that you are about as Australian as Mercedes Fracking Benz, get it?(oh forsooth...)PS: If both your parents are not born in Australia, then even if you ARE born on Australian soil, you belong to a category known as 'new' Australians, because you do not have the blessing of proper Australian parentage, so you most likely lack some important prerequisites to qualify as Australian.(It must be 'that' time of the fortnight again...)

18 May 2016 11:13:56amWe can be one people if we want.  We're quite friendly and hospitable with newcomers as long as they're honest about things and don't try to change the system we have when they simply lack the basic understanding that true Australians naturally possess.Thank you for your reply.  The part about this same old flawed chestnut that makes me laugh most is when I think of all the assimilatory kindness Australian-born emigrants get from fairly every single nation on the Globe where most of our new immigrants come from.  Like, as in, I hop on a plane to Saudi and practice my Wiccan Horned God worship out front in the street on Fridays before having a cool beer in the Sun, and everyone in Mecca calls me a Saudi Arabian ... hahaha ... welcome to our country new citizen from kangaroo-land and thank you for your improvement to our antiquated culture and new multicultural ways to hail the oncoming of the Arab Summer ... mate.

18 May 2016 12:02:39pmAh Big Ben you're post is full of assumptions. What the hell does a "true Australian naturally possess"?The word "naturally" is particularly disconcerting. What does that mean? Why is anyone born anywhere?Is it god? Or is it just random luck? The same luck that meant that after the Big Bang with stuff flying everywhere around the universe we ended up on a rock that happened to be at the precise distance from the Sun which was habitable for life. And even then we needed the dinosaurs to be wiped out and have a little window where intelligent life could form without being wiped out by another meteorite.So in the grand scheme of things (as in the universe) why do you think nationality has any bearing on anything for anyone?Unless you believe in god.

18 May 2016 12:35:30pmBecause some people have nothing else to be proud of apart from the purely coincidental location of their birth, as if being born in Australia somehow makes you different from being born in Lichtenstein.

18 May 2016 1:33:08pmAh I can see the problem we have. There's two ways of looking at this (it's more of a glass half full/half empty approach).Either:a) you can embrace your unbelievable good fortune of being born in a certain place, at a certain time, to certain people and in certain circumstances; orb) you consider that that good fortune somehow makes it all meaningless and makes you feel empty inside (and a little bit aggressive if you don't mind me saying so).I personally am a glass half full person (honestly). I actually am regularly blown away at how fortunate I am just to be. For no reason whatsoever I got my life. How fantastic is that?

18 May 2016 4:23:28pm"...the basic understanding that true Australians naturally possess."Nonsense. I teach high school. I have a law class. And so I have empirical evidence that there is no more "natural" understanding of our laws and legal process (our social framework for right and wrong) among white and Indigenous Australian kids than among migrant and first-gen Aussie kids.The only understanding anyone can be said to "naturally" possess is the one derived from the circumstances of their own upbringing. Not their society, mind you, which is what you seem to be getting at. Just their household. What sport to follow, what team to support. How parents speak to one another, if both are even present. What kind of food? Toilet paper: over or under?This kind of parochial understanding of what's "normal" is the only thing that could be said to be "naturally" acquired. Everything else, every that makes "community", is the product of being exposed to those who are different. And surprise surprise, migrants are just as capable of learning those lessons (or ignoring them and remaining parochial) as those born here.

18 May 2016 12:52:10pm'Claim' they were here first? We have carbon-dated evidence that our indigenous people were here first, scientifically verified and reproduced at sites across the country.As for the guilt, the fact that we have never acknowledged in law that they were the initial claimants to the land, that many still defend the concept of Terra Nullius, or claim that the lives of our Indigenous people were improved through European invasion (it is only colonisation on unclaimed land), despite massive mistreatment, numerous human rights violations, and turning their sacred sites into tourist attractions.As for making us all equal, that only works if we all have equal opportunities. We do not. They do not. We have a long way to go.

19 May 2016 9:13:24amYou missed the whole point of the article. It doesn't matter when your ancestors arrived. Nobody is more Australian than any other Australian, especially based on the heritage. That applies to aboriginals too.If someone wants to grow up holding a grudge because someone's great great grandad stole something from their great great grandad then that is on them. Others have not let their history dictate their future.If you become a citizen you are an Australian. If you were born here you are an indigenous Australian, simple.
Alert moderator
19 May 2016 12:41:39pmAs 'Indigenous Australians' is a term referring to a specific cultural-ethnic group, I would say that a better term for those born here would be 'natural-born australian.'Now, if you read my comment, you know that what I was taking issue with was not on the taking of the land itself, which can be seen as a product of societal norms at the time rather than strictly malicious. What is being taken issue with is the use of a false legal construct to excuse it, and the behaviour following it. We still have politicians who believe that the concept of Terra Nullius is valid, and politicians that fought against the apologies for more recent travesties, such as the stolen generation.The other conceit in your comment is saying that people are letting their history dictate their future. To that I would say that whilst some can ignore their history, for others, it is too much a defining factor due to the situation it has left them in. If you are born an Indigenous Australian in, for example, Alice Springs, then your prospects are nil. You have no firm educational infrastructure, no-one will hire you, and your scope for accomplishment is minimal. All because successive governments pushed Indigenous Australians out of more desirable areas and into the center of the country, and into a hellish situation.So I ask you, if the history of your culture is responsible for your life as a second class citizen, then how can you prevent that from dictating your future?
Alert moderator
19 May 2016 12:05:48pmOnieros,Name one major country or culture that has not ever been invaded or has never invaded another.History shows Europeans, Asians and Africans all used invasion to secure larger territories.  The only reason indigenous Australians never invaded anyone is because they had no real means to due to Australia's isolation.  But then again, Aboriginal tribes had territorial wars amongst themselves but did not use violence to subjugate other people but fought over resources, territory and women with one conflict killing 20% of the population of the tribes involved.You cannot impose todays morals and legalities on historical events.
Alert moderator
19 May 2016 12:47:09pmNo, but you CAN impose them on more recent atrocities, such as the stolen generation, the denial of land rights for sacred sites, the push to resettle Indigenous Australians in the center of the country, the constant discrimination both racial, economic, legal, and cultural that they face, numerous interventional measures that denied basic human rights such as autonomy, a sub-standard educational and health system, allowing people to literally climb up the side of one of their most sacred sites, and now pushes to further push them 'onto the reservation' through the removal of funding from communities our governments set up.By the way, I was taking issue with the continual referral to it as colonisation, a term which only works in concept if one accepts Terra Nullius.

You remind me of another Australian I met shortly after moving here.  He wanted to fight me because he overheard me conversing with his (English born) girlfriend where we both used the term "football", a term that many in Autralia believe only refers to either rubgy or AFL rather than the game to which it has a universal applciation. I later learned that his real issue was jealousy, because his girlfriend, a co-worker of mine at a work function where my own wife was present and part of the covnersation, was talking to another man.  It was a control thing, and he felt he didn't have control at the time, and fighting would give him control. (Actually it would have given him a lot of pain and regret at the time, but it never came to that, one of us had more sense). Do you have any of those feelings perhaps?

Then you will contemplate that yes, perhaps some of us ARE 100% Australian: born here, raised here, schooled here, built here, pure Australian.  That's nothing to brag about, but that's what Australians are, and if you're not born here, you're not Australian.  Your nationality is whichever country you were born, It's That Simple.

18 May 2016 12:58:30pmOnce again, you are using definitional language, when the article was one about cultural identity. There are many people who come to Australia and instantly gain the quintessential 'Australian-ness' and some that have had family here for generations but lack that quintessential espirit de Australis.As for the idea that being less multi-cultural makes us more Australian, I must scoff. As an example, in the gold rush of the 19th century, Australia got an influx of Chinese immigrants. They retained their culture for generations, building the groundwork for those to come, yet they were Australian. The culture of Australia is a multi-cultural one; there is no pure Australian.

18 May 2016 4:10:04pmCherry-picking? Perhaps. But I am trying to prove a point. Your definition is based purely on the idea that simply being born on this land changes ones identity. I disagree. What makes a man isn't where he is born, it is the values he adheres to, the experiences he has, and even his flaws. One can immigrate to a country and gain its national identity, and one can be born in a country and never quite gain one.As for your points, I was born in Australia, raised by Australian parents and grandparents. As per your requirements, I am 100% Australian. And I reject your definition. I reject it because it is anglo-centric, because it makes little logical sense, and because it denigrates many of my friends, and some of my family. I know what being an Australian is, and it has nothing to do with a genetic link to the land.Legally, logically, and morally, your definition is wrong.

18 May 2016 2:37:08pmAbsolute rubbish Big Ben. An Australian is someone who holds Australian citizenship. I was born and raised in Australia, as were my parents, all of my grandparents and great grandparents. And most of the generation before them.

18 May 2016 1:14:41pm"I think that continued segregation of peoples into nation-states will ultimately create division, mistrust and fear."A bit of a throwback from the pre-jet era perhaps?, when people generally DID stay around the locales where they were born, before all the mass-migration really began.  Now though, it is important that we don't go trying to take over the cultures of others, and just as important that we don't let other cultures take over ours either, but all gradually work together towards a more advanced society which keeps the good from different cultures and traditions, discarding the parts which conflict with the multicultural cohabitation on this ever-shrinking planet.The most important thing is to respect others, and keep our bulldust for the comedy clubs, Not here on The Drum, (although 2016 is turning into quite a laugh so far).  Open-heart surgery is about more than where - or who - you got your open-heart surgeons' ticket from, but you don't get to parade around in the streets carving up other innocent peoples' chests with a scalpel if you never went to medical school.Welcome to reality, Sunil.

18 May 2016 1:40:37pm"...but all gradually work together towards a more advanced society which keeps the good from different cultures and traditions, discarding the parts which conflict with the multicultural cohabitation on this ever-shrinking planet."I agree with this.But realistically, doesn't this mean that line-in-the-sand type categorisations of people as Australian that you advocate are counter-productive to achieving this goal?Don't these categorisations strongly imply an "us vs them" mind set to viewing the wider world and other cultures?Doesn't this create a perceived desirability of maintaining "purity" so that children have the "blessing" or "proper" Australian parentage to obtain "important" prerequisites for "qualification"?Those words I've put within quotations marks are so easily corruptible by those with extremist tendencies that could derail any social progress or harmony.

18 May 2016 1:02:42pmWe can all work together for the same human objectives, but being told that you are not a true member of the country you were born in because of your ancestry is counter-productive to that goal. You can categorise based on logical rules, but that in and of itself creates an infinite number of categories. So lets move to the point of the article: identity.Is it possible for someone not born here to identify as an Australian, to have an Australian identity? It depends what you define that identity as.
Alert moderator
18 May 2016 2:06:43pmYeah, we're getting somewhere it seems.  It comes back to Australian by degrees - a spectrum, firstly defined in a boolean manner by which country one is born in.  If you are not born in Vietnam, then you can never be Vietnamese, although you might somehow manage to get a work visa and learn the language.  You will still NEVER be Vietnamese if you are not born in Vietnam.So kid, the first prerequisite for being Australian is 'born in Australia', otherwise, you're not Australian Because You Are Something Else, okay?(forsooth)Next, your childhood is influenced by parents and extended family, so if you are born in Australia and spend your early life speaking Hindi at home and your mum never cooks beef for dinner, then you're officially Australian, but a fair part of you would be Indian, which means that you are less Australian than if you grew up speaking English and eating t-bone steak twice a week.  Okay?  Now are you all starting to understand how we can tell if someone is Australian or Indian or whatever?  It does not change at the arrivals lounge.  It is set when you are born, and that is what you get for this life.  Have a good think about it and get back to me tomorrow after you sleep on it, fellas.  This is not facebook.

18 May 2016 4:20:52pmOnce again, I have to disagree. I don't think being born in Australia confers some special identity. All it does is make you a natural-born citizen, and if we are only defining natural-born citizens as Australian, then we are discarding numerous Prime Ministers, Sports Stars, Scientists, Actors, Musicians, Writers and Comedians we like to claim as our own.Next up, you finally show a part of your argument that till this point was only implied: That the quintessential core of Australia is white, anglo-saxon and christian. It is a false argument for numerous reasons, including but not limited to the fact that:1- Anglo-Saxon culture was not the first culture to live in Australia,2- Saying that a particular diet makes one Australian is absurd,3- Very few families have the disposable income to afford T-Bone steak once a week,4- Lamb is more Australian anyway, and5- Your definition now comes across as anathema to most peoples understanding of the core values of Australia.Simply put, your idea of what is quintessentially Australian speaks to the view that culture is a zero-sum game.Yes, where you are born is part of your identity, but it is not what makes up one feeling of national identity, or belonging to a country.
Alert moderator
19 May 2016 12:21:25pmBit hard to claim that an Australian isn't a white anglo saxon Christian when 97% of Australians are white, around 74% with Anglo Celtic heritage and 60% identifying as Christian. (anglo-celtic is English, Scottish, Cornish, Welsh, Manx and Irish all combined or basically British heritage) Data from 2011 census.With Anglo and European descent being a dominant majority estimated to be between 85 and 92% it is a bit hard not to stereotype an average Australian as such, and statistically impossible to define as anything else.
Alert moderator
18 May 2016 1:18:44pmOr how about, provided they dont break any laws, anybody in this country can go about their own lives however they see fit? For example, if Australians with chinese heritage want to eat chinese food and speak mandarin and marry other chinese people living here, provided all those things are legal, they can do them? Naturally, you, big ben, wouldn't need to partake in those activities; you can continue to eat well done steak and veg, speak english (of sorts) and marry whatever "sheila" you want (provided she has consented of course).

18 May 2016 11:45:17amSo Big Ben, in your estimation, how far back to you have to go to be considered truly "Australian". If your grandparents are born here, great grandparents? This is a serious question, not a confrontational one, I'm interested in your mindset and the apparent contradiction in your post.I totally get your first paragraph. I'm an Australian citizen but not an Australian and although I've been here 27 years, I've never felt like one. I've lived in different parts of Australia and have aquired some of the colloquialisms, but as soon as I speakI'm "different" because of my accent.I do find it a bit strange that some sections of society expect new immigrants, no matter where from, to integrate/assimilate, absorb Aussie culture and become "True Blue".Yet if your thinking is commonplace, they're on a hiding to nothing because they'll never be considered as such, hence my question.ps. I don't mind "that time of the fortnight", headbutting all day, every day about politics, can get boring I think.

18 May 2016 12:32:01pmThank you for your sensible question, Angela.  If it's born in Australia then it's officially Australian by my reckoning, although Australian parents (2 of) are a very import factor because it takes a family to raise a child, and some might say even a community (I hate that word so let's say 'neighbourhood'), which covers other influences in a child's ontogical development.  I am very lucky to have had some quality time throughout my childhood with both my mother's parents, who were both Australian-born, and taught me a great deal of Australian history by their own personal experience, adding to my 'Australian-ness' towards 100% purity, but officially, if you want to be Australian, then you better ask your mum to give birth to you on Australian soil.  What you are depends most entirely on where in the World you took your first breath, and you can change your nationality, but you still live the life you were born with, and you can't change the country in which you were born, which determines your country of origin.  That is immutable.  I wish I was kon Thai but that is impossible unless I believe in reincarnation.I welcome you and others from overseas to my land, and wish you every success in assimilating and getting along with the natives, and just suggest that you try to encourage other newcomers to refrain from usurping the roles of others which are not theirs to take.  There is nothing wrong with many different nationalities all working together, as long as we are all honest, and don't try to steal the national identities of others when it's not ours to take.I hope that helps answer a very simple question that for some strange reason, takes an extraordinary degree of explanation to the typical Drum readers who lack education in the basics of the English language. (That was why the forsooth up there - this article should never have been published here; more total fiction from the Australian Bulldust Corporation.)

18 May 2016 1:17:14pmBig Ben, I can see and understand your point of view perfectly.I live (and will most likely die) in Australia and have had some good years here, but my "home" will always be the country I was born and grew up in.Thanks for answering my question with such a comprehensive reply.
Alert moderator
18 May 2016 1:31:32pmNow we get to the problem; the difference between national identity and country of origin. Specifically, whether the two are the same, or one is mutually exclusive of the other. Quite frankly, I would say that ones country of origin does not exclude one from adopting a national identity, as can be seen in the numerous people we call our own who weren't born here.As for taking roles which should only be held by Australians, I would as what roles those were. Is it the role of an Australian, which I have always linked to conduct more then origin, or is it that you are saying that immigrants should have a ceiling on their achievements?Finally, the fact is that the article was trying to define our national identity, what makes someone an Australian by identity, rather than defining what an 'Australian' is on a country of origin level.

18 May 2016 10:29:36pmThat is a different matter for a number of reasons.First, I'm talking about people who gain the national identity through living here and gaining citizenship, not those who simply self-describe whilst on vacation.Secondly, saying that you are a Thai person is different from saying you are Australian, as there is the added dimension of the ethnic group known by the term of 'Thai,' whilst there is no ethnic group associated with 'Australian,' it is a question of ethnic identity, not national identity, and if you can't tell the difference between the two then you have missed something of what is the Australian spirit.Third, what other nations and ethnic groups use as markers to define membership is not of concern in this discussion, as a) we are a different country and culture, and b) many of these cultures would not accept your definition.Fourth, my running abilities are finely tuned, thank you very much.Finally, if immigrants and the children of immigrants, and their grandchildren are not Australian, then neither are the things they built, like the Snowy Hydro Scheme, the Sydney Opera House, and the Harbour Bridge. The only landmarks we have that weren't built by immigrants were naturally occurring.

Unless you are 100% Aboriginal (by the category you outlined), you should not be assuming a position of welcoming people to 'your' land.

And I'm stumped by what you mean that newcomers should "refrain from usurping the roles of others which are not theirs to take" - I genuinely want to know what you're referring to.As a migrant who came here on a plane at the age of 10 with my parents, your post reads as extremely arrogant.

18 May 2016 12:44:53pmSo at what point, under your definition, does one become an 'authentic' Australian? The third generation? The fourth? Fifth? More? What if one parent was born in Australia and one wasn't? What if you were born in another country but raised by Australians? The definition you use is the definition one would use for cattle, and does not properly capture our national identity.Besides which, under your definition our last Prime Minister wasn't an Australian, and I didn't see you raising a stink about that.

18 May 2016 1:22:11pm"So at what point, under your definition, does one become an 'authentic' Australian? "When all your living relatives (ie. mum dad, grand parents, aunts, uncles, cousins) are Australian throughout your development.  Anything beyond the grave is not relevant because it must come second-hand to the living, so this is quite fundamental stuff.  What makes an Australian is 18 years of childhood in Australia amongst Australians.  It is not something anyone should necessarily aspire to, just like Aussie-made Magnas were crap cars with weak cylinder heads, but Australian cars is what they were at the time (even if it was a mixup between Chrysler/Valiant and Mitsubishi).This is how we communicate in the 21st century.

18 May 2016 2:13:46pmAh, but therein lies the issue, if you are raised by someone who was not raised in this manner, then can you raise someone as an 'Australian?' For example, is a child born to immigrant parents in Australia 50% Australian? Then what? If they marry and procreate with someone in their same condition, would that be 75% Australian offspring. Thus it continues ad infinitum.You can keep your definition, but I tend to think that people are cultural sponges. Some of us can walk from culture to culture and always seem like a native, whilst others cannot adapt. Thus, I would say that anyone emigrating to Australia could become an Australian, both in law and in national identity.

I can quite picture you, fresh from hand-scrubbing your laundry, gleefully rubbing your hands with delight at the response you know you're going to get from this sort of post. And then you got it. And you got to use lots of big words and put them together in all sorts of ways that sought by sheer weight of waffle, to batter (pardon the pun) your detractors into submission. So I won't bother rehashing others' points. I'd just like to ask about this category of new Australians, which I find fascinating. Its kind of like you've set out a ridiculous criterion to define 'Australian', then realised its logically inconsistent so had to invent a means around it. Of course, you wouldn't do that.  If, say, I was born in Australia but my parents were not, I would be a 'new' Australian. What if I'm born to one Australian-borne parent and one non-Australian borne parent? Am I half Australian? Mostly Australian? new old Australian? Does it matter which parent was Australian borne? Is Australian-ness like Jewish-ness, descending down the maternal line?Grateful for your advice. See, in fact, I was born to one non-Australian born parent and one that was Australian born (indeed - the parent born in Australia had parents and grandparents born in Australia). But, there's that pesky absence of inappropriate parentage so I'd just really like to understand my status as an Australian. Thanks!

18 May 2016 3:53:01pmMy pleasure, but don't thank me.  It's fact, so enjoy your new understanding of the true meaning of the word, 'Australian'.  It means, 'from Australia'.  It takes a lot of brains to work stuff like that out, doesn't it?

18 May 2016 8:54:10pmBenI'm still confused I'm sorry. I was born in Australia. This makes me, according to you, some type of Australian. According to you, there are various types of Australians depending on the length of their Australian-born lineage. I'm just trying to understand how an Australian born person with one Australian born parent and one non-Australian born fits into your schema. I'm not arguing with your definition - just asking you to explain what type of an Australian such a person would be. Also, I wonder if you'd mind outlining for me what you consider "Australia" for the purposes of being born in "Australia". Do you mean the main landmass? Do you include Tasmania? Torres Strait islands? Bass Strait islands? Whitsundays? Do you just consider the land, or would it be OK to be born on a boat inside the 12 nautical mile limit? How about the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone? Would the boat need to be Australian flagged?What about territories further afield - the Cocos Islands? Coral sea islands? Heard and McDonald Islands? What about the Australian Antarctic Territory? How about Norfolk Island?How about Macquarie Island and Lord Howe Island? They're administered by Australian states, not the Commonwealth. Do they count?As widely known, the Australian Constitution lists New Zealand as a state of Australia in the preamble. Are New Zealanders actually Australians?Just trying to figure out where I fit in this crazy world. As you note somewhere in this thread, words need to be used in accordance with their definition to be meaningful. I'd hate to confuse someone by calling myself "Australian" when I'm not, or permitting someone else not born to the correct parents and in the correct location to do the same.

I could be born in international waters, with, say, Perth as my next port of a call and I'd be as Australian as someone born in the shadow of Uluru? (assuming equivalent parentage, naturally.)Also, are you now saying its possible to choose to be Australian? Perhaps my next port of call could be Jakarta or Sydney or Wellington. Can I choose whether I'm Australian or Indonesian or New Zealander? Sure, if my parents weren't Australian I'd just be an untermensch-type 'new' Australian, but I could choose?

18 May 2016 7:33:55pmUtter rubbish from "Big Ben".You'll find few people who are more Australian than my maternal grandfather was. From the age of 13, when he was kicked out of home like his brothers with a horse, a watch and 5 bob, until his late 30's he didn't have a fixed address as he was working on properties on various jobs. A true stockman he spent more time over those years sleeping outside in his swag, under his horse when it rained, than under a roof. With all the money he'd saved he bought a property outright then built the first of three houses and got married. He didn't stop riding his pony until it died when he was in his 90's and the same with driving. He couldn't stop driving because he had to take "the old guy" down the road, who was only two years older, into town once a fortnight as well. He was in hospital only two times in his life. At birth and during the last week of his life. The only reason he didn't serve in the war was due to foot problems which also excluded his brother, despite being exceptional athletes. As kids they would chase down rabbits barefoot for fun and a good meal.His parents spoke English with a very heavy German accent. To hear anybody say that someone who couldn't have been more Australian if he tried is a "new Australian" is truly ridiculous. That's the sort of thing you'd expect from a person who thinks wearing an Aussie flag, or worse a Southern Cross Flag, and getting drunk and getting into fights is what makes someone Australian. Australians ARE mostly "mongrels" as you'd put it and that's what makes us such a great nation and especially on the sporting field. Real Australians don't care about the circumstances of another person's birth and don't think such things make one person better than another. Being Australian is about a state of mind not your DNA or where you were born. You might have been born here from parents who were as well but you're not a true Aussie no matter how many beers you can drink or how many times you've sung Waltzing Matilda in your Wallabies jersey at ANZAC Cove. However like anyone on this planet you could still become one.

19 May 2016 7:48:32am@Big BenYour 'theory' is logically inconsistent - if it requires two (or at least one) prior generations of 'real' Australians born here to produce an 'real' Australian then there cannot be any 'real' Australians at all. (o tempora o mores...)Think about it mate, at some point any lineage will have to trace back to having non-Australian parents, therefore they aren't Australian in your book (one with big, crudely scribbled letters drawn in crayon presumably) therefore there children aren't Aussies and so on all the way down to you.(oh slubberdegullion...)It's also pointlessly divisive and a long winded way of acting smugly superior to 'new' Australians or, presumably worse still, non-Australians. Face it - this is just a way to let you define 'true' Australians for yourself and ignore people who disagree with you as not being 'proper' Australians. Twist it around all you want but those are the facts.(oh the power and the passion...)In short stop trying to divide this nation up with pathetic theories about how Australian others are - instead try to respect our laws here mate; here in Australia we collectively define someone as being Australian if they have Australian citizenship.

They consider the Tamils, who came to Sri Lanka hundreds of years ago, as well as those brought by the Brits from India to work the tea plantations as intruders. They encouraged discrimination against non-Sinhalese. Politicians were encouraged to stand on that platform and it ended with organized massacres (with names and addresses from electoral lists to identify Tamils) of Tamils. This led to a massive civil war that lasted for decades as Tamil youth armed and created an army and declared a separate nation. A large number of Tamils became refugees in India and around the world. Their children no longer speak Tamil.The civil war led to dictatorial leaders and lots of corruption (massive military expenditures). I doubt the country will regain what it lost. I came to Australia for postgrad  study and remained behind because of the increasing anti-Tamil sentiment. As a result, when there was the August 1983 massacre I was able to get those of my family living there,  out of Sri Lanka.You are right - it takes a long time to absorb the culture of a place. But some things come naturally. Some others dont. For me, the manic sport obsession never took. On the other hand, that everyone is intrinsically equal, irrespective of what they do was SO welcome, because it had bugged me in Sri Lanka.And yes, it is happening in Myanmar.  I personally think any organized religion with a special caste of people who are in charge of it is dangerous, whatever the flavour. Religion requires you to suspend critical thinking and then having someone able tohave authrority over that mind? Dangerous stuff. A kind of zombie invasion.

18 May 2016 11:53:12amHPH, You suggest "There wasn't "so much comment about Muslims in the media" before 2001 and/or 2003 (when The USA attacked Afghanistan and Iraq.)"Indeed..... as Islamic terrorism in the 1970's, 1980's and 1990's was rarely reported in the western media beyond the regular attacks / hijackings etc in Europe.Perhaps folks have come to realise that there is more to Islamic terrorism than a desire to destroy the jewish state, or to establish 'just' a pan Arabian Islamic caliphate.But more importantly folks were more focused on nuclear Armageddon up until 1991.Not to mention developed nations had remarkably different migration and border control policies (in the 1970's - 1990's) and therefore lacked awareness about what the fundamental doctrines and cultural norms of some Islamic peoples really were.The Europeans got a huge dose of "cultural enrichment" last year....... though it appears they didn't enjoy it as much as they were lead to believe they would.

In your reply to me on Ben Wellings' page you said: "It is interesting that you believe that the people of Iraq, Syria and Libya were unable to anything other than choose to descend into a brutal sectarian civil war split along age on tribal/religious lines."Read my original post to see if I wrote anything remotely resembling your statement above.

One day you will come to realise that human beings make choice each and every day and their lives, and their nations are the collective effect of their collective personal choices. Right now they can put down their weapons and live in peace.... but they ...yes..... they... choose not to.

Alert moderator
18 May 2016 1:41:15pmNot really.During the cold war the west, specifically against the wishes of the majority of Muslims and of the local regimes, empowered jihadist groups to fight a proxy war with the USSR. Whilst this did keep Soviet influence in the region minimal, it also led to increasing incursions and attacks against those the groups opposed, usually members of different sects and moderate members of their own sect. Now after a while, these groups turned to America as a target so they could drum up recruitment with publicity. The result was the 9/11 attacks. Following that, the west, rather then going after those responsible, launched a war on a nebulous concept of 'terror' and George Bush Jr. used said war as an excuse to push his 'freedom agenda.' From there, the entire situation spiraled out of control, leading to the Arab Spring and the rise of ISIS.

19 May 2016 12:46:47pmAll the wests fault for encouraging jihadists.  Nothing about the numerous coups from 1973 when the King of Afghanistan was ousted by Sardar Khan, or the 1978 where he was assassinated and a pro Soviet Communist Government under Taraki was established followed by another coup in 79 which provoked a Soviet invasion and the installation of Babrak Karmal as president.  Nothing like an invasion by hostile military forces to get ones attention.  It was then that the US, China and Saudi Arabia supported the Mujahidin.  Who were Afghan resistance to up to 100000 Soviet troops who used bombing and depopulating rural areas in an effort to subdue the opposition. The reason the Soviets invaded was to secure an exemplar of the Brezhnev Doctrine which stated once a country became socialist, Moscow would never permit it to return to the capitalist camp.So yes the US did conduct a proxy war against the USSR, but only after the USSR invaded Afghanistan and only by supporting those fighting the Soviet troops in the same way the USSR supported the Viet Cong in Vietnam and the Chinese supported North Korea in the Korean War.

Don't forget that most racists don't even realise they are racist, and that most racist acts and statements are not easily discernible to the non-expert.In fact, by stating that Australia is not a racist nation, you have actually showed that you are a racist yourself.You should be ashamed of yourself.  Somebody may have been upset because you said that, and it is all your fault because you are an unconscious racist.

You might correct me if they play a role in yours. I've never met a follower of Islam who has violent outcomes. You've admitted you've never met any either. That would suggest only a minority do. Scientologists are pretty much confined to English speaking, western countries. They're not global and there aren't many of them.

18 May 2016 3:33:50pmHi Dove,Of course it is meant for you. But Desert Woman is of course free to add her (his?) worthy commentary if they so wish.Surely the angels that count all your good and bad deeds have an opinion on whether or not your compliance, or lack thereof, to sharia financial services represents a good or a bad deed?Clearly collective belief in a mythology plays some role in supporting the belief of adherents. After all if 2 billion people believe in a mythology they can't be wrong can they?I'm glad to hear you haven't personally met a follower of Islam who had violent outcomes as I understand that it generally a terminal event. The daily Islamic terrorist acts world wide being a clear example of this ("Je Suis Bagdad" again today). I wonder.... what doctrines and mythical ideologies imbued them with a desire for destructive actions and martyrdom?Scientologists have a global membership of around 15,000,000 (vastly more than both the Jedi faith and the Asatru combined). As what point does a 'critical mass' occur causing the adherents to begin to spontaneously combust I wonder? or could it be that 'vilification' and 'criticisms of a religion' really aren't the problem that they are made out to be by certain quarters? perhaps the problem is in fact the underlying doctrines of certain mythologies?

18 May 2016 5:06:50pmJoe, Old Red is right as far as I am concerned.Two people can refute an argument: one does it with respect and understanding of the other's perspective that led to their position in the debate. The other just goes in boots and all with no attempt to observe that the person on the other side is a human being with all that means.There is much more to a human life than being right/wrong/ or rich/poor or religious/atheist or agnostic. There is much more to a life and a culture than appears when we take one variable at a time. We are a conversational species and we enrich us all when we observe the complexity of the person in their context.  That is when conversation and real learning happens. Very little learning happens when one person simply tries to 'win' by assuming the high ground.

18 May 2016 8:45:42pm@JoeBloggsIf someone is wrong...... then they are wrong but it still doesn't excuse you from normal standards of human respectful interaction.Also there are differences between someone being wrong and someone disagreeing with you or between questioning someone's beliefs and flat out calling them mindless, brainwashed idiots.Furthermore Dawkins has often been wrong - even in his chosen field. Should we assume he's therefore mentally ill or deficient as Dawkins has stated about religious people repeatedly?I'd also ask you to consider whether your goal is simply to attack people or to change minds - if it's the former then what I said really does apply, it's simply an exercise in feeling smug and superior. If it's the latter then going about it by calling their beliefs "'eternal life insurance' scams" with a "vested interest in continuing to baffle, trick and indoctrinate humans" is probably not going to help you change things. Waffling about your "duty to at least attempt to protect children" from the beliefs of their parents is in all but the most of extreme of cases dangerous twaddle. It's the kind of excuse that used to be given to take children away from indigenous Australians.ps Do you not honestly see the difference between simple math tests where the answers are known and things as complex as entire cultures and beliefs about the vast universe and how it came to be - things that science is still trying to find the answers to? Also would you want children to be insulted and have their mental faculties questioned for getting wrong answers in their maths tests?pps People have a right to be wrong in any case. Without that right science couldn't exist or function. So try questioning their reasoning instead of treating them as fools and fraudsters maybe?

19 May 2016 10:16:32amHello Old Red,Indeed, I agree that normal standards of human respectful interaction is appropriate here... and elsewhere.If you feel I have overstep the bounds of normal human debate then please feel free to take umbrage with me and point out the exact moment I have allegedly done so, or failing that you have the ability to "alert moderator" is you feel I have taken insufficient heed and feel the need for some impartial judgement.I do not believe I have referred to anyone here as an idiot, but you can correct me if I am wrong. I have certainly at times pointed out that religious organisations do in fact undertake the indoctrination and brainwashing of young children in order to ensure they develop into adults whom are sufficiently indoctrinated into the mythology in question. That however is not a charge against the human in question, but the processes of the religious organisation as it seeks to ensure it has sufficient future (paying) members.I have little interest in deprogramming those heavily indoctrinated into religious beliefs as that is a huge process and generally needs to be driven by the person in question (best to ask 'survivors' who are no longer believers how to go about it).I however do feel it would be appropriate to highlight the clear inappropriateness of various religious doctrines (of various religions) and their consequences on society. Just as I feel it is appropriate to seek to encourage an awareness of the processes of indoctrination and the associated appropriateness of a legislative change that would preclude religious organisation and their representatives from being allowed to indoctrinate anyone person (child or adult) who does not have the mental capacity (a legal definition) to provide informed consent to the process of indoctrination.Like you say, you can't stop an adult from believing in whatever nonsense takes their fancy, nor should we. But certain orthodoxies and ideologies are inappropriate for children and the organisations promoting them should be prevented from indoctrinating children.Thanks for mentioning taking children off people, but I do not believe that anyone has suggested anything like that.Actually there is little difference between a math test and the veracity of any mythology, both can be defined as either true or false (in the case of mythologies they have consistently been found to be false and in error).Similarly you can judge the merits of certain doctrines of any mythology or orthodoxy by virtue of its cultural impact on society.Science isn't about being wrong, it is about a process whereby a theory can be judged (to put it very simply). Similarly mythologies are just theories.... which have been found to be poor theories and in error.Kind regards

Instead, they are brought in to rebalance the labour market in favour of employers - business and government, and to prop up the all important property market.The people who come here now are not coming here for our way of life - which may have been true of the Brits, Europeans and Kiwis who made up the majority of our immigration until recent times. Instead, they are fleeing the subcontinent, Middle East and China, which have been destroyed by overpopulation and environmental degradation. Indeed, all of the great mass migration of today is being driven by the same basic factors of overpopulation and the loss of opportunity that goes with it, and environmental degradation. This may lead to conflict, which may act as a trigger, but it is overpopulation and environmental destruction at root cause.We appear desperate to repeat their mistakes.

18 May 2016 10:32:13pmWell, putting aside the fact that that would violate our international agreements, would lead to a population decline that would trash our economy, and deny us a skilled migrant intake, it, quite frankly, wouldn't help. The reason being that the 'damage' you are referring to has already been done. We are a melting pot, and that can't be changed without mass deportations. But putting aside the stupendous intolerance you just showed, your problem also raises massive legal issues.Quite frankly, it is the worst kind of isolationism; the kind that doesn't even try to be viable.

18 May 2016 2:16:27pmHi Hairy Nosed Wombat,I see you have some mistaken beliefs.Those that are able to come here under our skilled migrant program are in fact highly skilled and they have to not only have a skill set that is actually in demand (as defined by the government) but they also have to have their skill set verified and deemed to be of an appropriately high standard by our very own Australian counterpart organisations. As such they are of equivalent to an Australian counterpart in terms of education and trained (and usually more so when it comes to experience). If their skill set/training/education is not to an equivalent Australian standard then they are rejected under that category.As for coming for our way of life, ... in fact they still are coming to Australia not only for the land/environment, the infrastructure but predominately for the lifestyle and culture of Australia that is world renowned.Remember these people are skilled, and therefore coveted by all/most developed nations. They have their pick of destinations and choose Australia because of what we are as a nation.I do agree with your statement that billions of people do covet coming to our nation (and other developed nations) as economic migrants as their own nations are ravaged by pollution, environmental destruction, over population, lack of opportunity, endemic corruption, cultural failure.As such we are right to select only those that will best assist our nation as a whole, and who will also be appreciative of the opportunity to join our nation and embrace our fundamental cultural norms.

18 May 2016 3:20:12pmBollocks. The government brought literally tens of thousands of people into the country to my job, simply to drive down our income to keep a lid on costs. I can tell you i have spoken to people in the Canberra who will tell you that was exactly what they did. Lots of people locally wanted the job, but the opportunity was given away to folks from overseas instead. It certainly wasn't due to lack of local demand. A few years down the track, many of the more recently locally trained people are unable to get work - the jobs are all gone by the time they have completed training. Many have been forced overseas for work opportunities. Yet bizarrely, if i have a look, my profession is still listed as "in demand" and a very high point scorer for immigration purposes. It isn't like this is unique to my profession, or even my sector of the economy (although it is particularly commonplace in this industry). Ask the guys in IT. Ask the nurses. Have a look at the list of in demand skills. It's a bad joke.This is about two things. Keeping wages down, and keeping property prices up. Because that makes the people who donate to the ALP and Liberal Party rich.
Alert moderator
18 May 2016 4:23:40pmI think you're right about the points you make HNW, but if we froze immigration we will also practically freeze population growth.Low to nil population growth hinders economic growth.As you point out, it would likely also mean higher wages and, correspondingly, a higher rate of inflation.I think this would put us on a perilous path to stagflation if there was a market shock.Further, while it would be nice for jobs to remain with Australian workers, globalisation and technology has made this a pipe dream.All the major banks, for example, outsource most of their document preparation services to Indian workers.Many major companies outsource their telephone marketing and customer helplines etc to the Philippines, India or Indonesia.Aluminium manufacturing, steel making etc is, more and more, being outsourced to Chinese mills.Frankly, I would really like to a see a strong Australian manufacturing sector. I reckon we could really well in the tech and pharmaceutical/biotech sectors - not unlike Germany (high cost, but high quality).But this won't happen because it is too expensive to invest here and we don't have the political leadership or will to do it.
Alert moderator
18 May 2016 5:08:24pmBut if you stop immigration, we'll start breeding again. We can't afford to breed because of property prices and job insecurity. Both of which largely come down to immigration.The problem is that our elites, our protected classes, have made a decision that it is cheaper and easier to bring people in from overseas than to invest in our kids.And we are just standing around accepting it, bound to accept it out of misplaced political correctness.Stuff political correctness. I'm not racist, but i do care for my kids more than i care for other peoples' kids. No more immigration. My kids are more important than some rich developers bank balance.
Alert moderator
19 May 2016 12:54:15pmYou are wrong on many points here.Job insecurity is not related to immigration. Rather, it is linked to an industrial relations landscape that is increasingly biased in favour of Employers, aided by internet application systems that all but ensure each new position has at least 40 applicants. As for property prices, that is partially related to population growth, but is much more linked to property investment, spurred by policies such as negative gearing.As for the idea that we'll 'start breeding again,' that is patently false. Essentially, the lower birth rate is not a result of migration or a lack of government assistance, but a result of changing gender politics. As more women access higher levels of education, and engage in the workforce more, the previous 'breadwinner/homemaker' balance has changed, and the birth rate has declined.Finally, when you use the term 'our kids,' are you referring only to 'Australian' kids, or do the kids of those who have immigrated factor into the equation to?P.S. How do you intend to deal with the family visa program?
Alert moderator
18 May 2016 12:23:47pmI understand what you're getting at, but I can't help but think that a large part of Australian culture is multiculturalism.We accept and tolerate anyone provided they contribute to society.Remember the hysteria about the Asian invasion and, more recently, the latest Islamic takeover?The Asian invasion didn't happen and it won't. Why? Because by the time the third and fourth generation roll around, they are more or less Australian. They even refer to themselves as 'bananas' (yellow on the outside, white on the inside). They inter-marry, work hard and, most importantly, consider themselves to be Australian. Yes, they have family ties to Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, wherever, but they consider 'home' to be Australia.The same will happen with the recent Middle Eastern and African immigrants. It will just take considerable time (at the very least 30 years). In the same you cannot expect an Australian to become (or be accepted as) a German, Iraqi or Chinese in 15 years, you cannot expect our most recent immigrants to do the same.This process is not going to dilute or warp what might be perceived as 'traditional' Australian culture. This is because of the simple fact that there aren't enough immigrants to have enough influence to radically change our culture and the traditional culture is far too entrenched. Accepting a bunch of Syrian refugees is not going to spell the end of lamb on Australia Day, football on the weekend and cricket in the summer, now or ever. It will only mean that the descendants of those refugees will share the lamb, watch the football and play cricket with our children and our grandchildren in the future.

My kids do not have the same freedom and opportunity i knew, and increasingly i find my opportunities and quality of life is diminished in comparison to my parents despite the fact i have studied and worked harder.

18 May 2016 3:20:57pmSo you're unhappy with your economic lot in life? How is that supposed to be the fault of multiculturalism or immigration? The world, as well as Australia, is more capitalism-driven, the economic divide between rich and poor has grown, the mass information age seems to appeal to the lowest common denominator. All very disappointing, but none of those are the fault of either a broadening of our culture or where immigrants come from."All that has happened is that a few rich people have made a lot more money out of "development"Possibly, but that's happened everywhere around the world regardless of multiculturalism.

18 May 2016 4:34:30pm"It isn't that i am old that has soured me. It is that i have kids. And i can see that their prospects suck."I think if your children are in traditional blue collar industries (except mining - another boom will come), then yeah I'd probably agree with you.My father was adamant that myself and my brothers went to university and got white collar jobs. At the time, I thought he was being arrogant. Now I think he was clairvoyant.But I don't think there are less opportunities out there, just different ones. Our children have to compete with the rest of the world, it seems. Not just the kid in the next classroom.
Alert moderator
18 May 2016 4:56:56pmI'll add that this competition for new jobs has already occurred in Europe.European students have to compete with the rest of the EU for university places as well as for new jobs.So if you're sitting your final high school exams in Italy, you need to do just as well or better than your German, French or Danish etc counterparts to get to university.
Alert moderator
18 May 2016 5:34:58pmYes, but if you are in the top 1% in Germany, you'll also be in the top 1% if you combine Italy, France and Germany.Academically, i 'spose i could say i have achieved in the top fraction of the top 1% percent. And there's the problem, because despite that, i still have no job security - it just means that my job ends up "targeted" by the government. Instead of pushing Australian kids to these higher levels, they'll just bring people in from overseas. I don't mind competition. I like competition. What immigration has done is to take the rewards of coming out at the top of the competition and then gone and split it between those who thought they had won, and a whole lot of new people they brought in from outside the game. Unless, of course you are able to hide in a industry where you have a "protected" status. My problem is that my profession got "targeted". I'll get my kids to go into finance instead, i 'spose. Slightly better than starving to death. Kinda like choosing to become a zombie rather than being eaten by them.
Alert moderator
18 May 2016 6:03:59pmIf your profession was targeted, it was probably because there was a shortage of qualified personnel to do the job.Overseas workers are brought it in to fill the gap.Then the uni students graduate and there is nowhere for them to go, leading to underemployment , retraining or moving overseas themselves.IT was a classic example of this.At the end of the day, it seems to me that immigration is a scapegoat for the new globalised economy and the openness of the modern labour market.

18 May 2016 7:24:12pmIt's got nothing to do with linguistic sophistication.You can shut the doors on immigration if you want, but that bubble will ultimately burst because our labour force will be uncompetitive and we'll struggle to get investment dollars in.Then we'll eventually stagnate with high wages and inflation and you can leave that legacy with your kids to clean up if you want.It would be nice to enjoy the world of the 60s that my parents and yourself enjoyed. But I can't and neither can my children.So I won't waste my time pining for a world that can simply not exist in the future. I'd rather adapt and teach my kids to adapt with it.

18 May 2016 9:58:00pmSo what you are saying is that the government should be allowed to bring new people in to the labour market to push wages down to benefit their preferred vested interests. Because, I'll point out, that's actually contrary to immigration law. Obviously, it's what they do, but do you really think it's right? Really? What happens when your daughter finally finishes university and postgraduate studies in engineering, and a few businessmen who donate a lot of money to the ALP says I'm paying much to much money to these engineers. Let us bring in a few hundred from overseas to get our wage costs down. You will just suggest she goes back to university and retrains in some new career? Most ridiculously, the opportunity of migrating to find work is now closed to us when we find our area of training, because increasingly foreign countries are closing their borders to us, so as to protect their own citizens employment opportunities. Once upon a time I could have gone to dozens of countries to get work. These days, that number is limited to just a few. 'Cause other countries wouldn't dare do what we are prepared to do to our own. We are actually quite unique in our attitude to immigration.

18 May 2016 5:49:13pmNo it isn't. You don't understand how Western governments have been using immigration. "Winning the competition" just means you'll get yourself "targeted". Have a talk to people in immigration - it's exactly what they do. What is 'sposed to happen is that kids are 'sposed to pick careers around future job opportunities and income - that's how the labour market should work. There will be a financial reward for going into an area with a shortage or where less people attain the required standards. Government and vested interests use immigration to disrupt this process - because then they'd end up having to pay those kids more money when they are finished training. If a career option is in shortage, they'll just flood the market with immigrants, to push wages and conditions down. By the time the locals complete their training, the job opportunities will be gone, and they'll be working for the new imports. That is, unless you are wise enough to go into a "protected" sector.

18 May 2016 10:52:42amXenophobia has never had much to do with what people look like, though in times before it's made an easy identifier. for outsiders It has to do with culture. Some cultures have terrible values our own culture abhors. To say the truth, certain cultures have particularly terrible records when it comes to certain things we Australians simply think is basic decency. Unfortunately, where the anger towards others is coming from is that certain elements shout out the criticism of these cultures with accusations of bigotry, all while declaring open season on criticizing the majority Australian culture. So no, it doesn't matter where we come from, but where we come from; what culture we come from, often matters most.

18 May 2016 10:53:04amLondoners voted for a Labor mayor. The Tories might well have run a Muslim candidate themselves for all it would matter. The world's biggest Muslim city has a Christian mayor, Basuki Purnama, aka Ahok. And he's not the first. He didn't get the job for his religious views and the sky hasn't fallen in. In the world's most populous Muslim countries one of the state governors is a Catholic. He's into his second term. In an age full of bigotry and anti-Semitism, Australia had a Jewish Governor General and we celebrated our greatest soldier, Monash.Australians don't care what their neighbours look like, what language they speak at home, what clothes they wear, what food they eat, how they vote- even how they pray. This is possibly the most tolerant and accepting place on earth. In fact, that's a drawcard. Australians do care about what people do, how people behave and how they treat others. In that we are rigid, inflexible and rightly so.Shame some are more influenced by the tellie-box than through their own experiences

18 May 2016 11:29:42amWell said Dove.I think you correctly identify a number of key elements of Australian culture that should be celebrated and kept to the fore of ones mind when discussing various issues.Aussies are wonderfully apathetic when it comes to caring about irrelevant differences between people.And they are at heart still crudely outspoken and prepared to call a spade a spade ..... even if that causes those imbued with a PC mind to suffer a shiver up their spines and become a quivering mess of self-righteousness.Countless British officers suffered the ire of a quick witted "uncouth" Aussie unprepared to suffer fools gladly or remain silent when something needed to be said about inappropriate behaviours. And that cultural trait, arguably, remains strong today within the population .......which has given rise to, arguably, inappropriately levelled allegations of national racism/bigotry.Some folk it seems need to realise that ideologies and doctrines are not people.

18 May 2016 12:28:53pmFor mine being Australian is more about accepting basic cultural values, showing an interest in and a knowledge of the new country.  Dress is a part of that.  A burqa comes over as a sign that people are not interested in committing to a new identity, indeed it is a rejection of Australia and its values, a sign of a determination to keep a distance.  As an older white Australian, and a somewhat standoffish one at that, a brown face is still often a minor speed hump in relating to a new person.  There is an initial impression that this person is different, wonder where they come from, are they friendly or unfriendly, will they know what I am talking about?  A quick conversation can get around those first impressions.  Cricket!  We all know we can't tell a book by its cover but we still read the blurb on the cover and often base our decisions on that.I have a friend that came to Australia from Vietnam almost 40 years ago.  Still has a very noticeable accent but has what I see as Australian values though quite happy in an Asian environment.  Gets upset when people still ask her where she comes from, having spent more than two-thirds of her lifetime here.  Wonders what she has to do to be considered Australian.  Just talk to people I suppose.  Sadly she's not in a good place at the moment.

18 May 2016 2:44:18pmOUB,I have noticed that Australians love to ask people "where do you come from". Many new migrants tend to feel that this simple question has some inappropriate undertones....yet what the don't perhaps immediately realise is that the Australian is actually interested in the migrant as a person, and would (if they could) regale them with a tale or two about visiting said nation in order to create a common bond, and have a good old fashioned yarn.It isn't about distinguishing between 'Australians' and 'others', it is a way in which people go about establishing a relationship (albeit a brief one in passing at times).Many of our cultural behaviours are misinterpreted by new migrants not familiar with them.Note too that this question of "where do you come from" is a very common one world wide.People are simply curious.... it is human nature after all.

18 May 2016 4:00:54pmI agree, where do you come from is not an obnoxious question, it is curiosity, and also politeness. It is something we ask others as well, as it is interesting to know why and how we all ended up in Australia. At present I also live in France, in a little town that has people from other parts of the world living here. We all want to know where the other is from, and it gives us a great feeling of living somewhere chosen by so many people.Political correctness, instead of natural courtesy,  is not a great exchange.

18 May 2016 10:53:46amWhile Australia is indeed an immigrant nation; assertions that imply Australia should some how jettison its Anglo Celtic backbone, for a new-found multicultural identity, are the very  assertions which are causing annoyance among many Australians. These assertions are often followed (online) by derogatory remarks about being "convict scum" or "genocidal murderers". Remarks that are unhelpful when new immigrants should be trying to assimilate.

18 May 2016 11:07:14am"for a new-found multicultural identity"There is no such thing.How does getting around in a full burqa display any inkling of the acceptance of multiculturalism?It is quite the opposite - a rejection of other cultures in preference to there own.
Alert moderator
18 May 2016 1:50:58pmWell first off, what you are seeing is unlikely to actually be a burqa. More likely, you are referring to the Niqab. It is a cultural garment, much like a Sikhs turban, or even a humble Hijab. What this comes down to is that you do not understand the custom, nor what it means for a society to be multicultural.A multicultural society is one where the population belongs to the greater society whilst retaining their own individual customs, languages, etc. What you are trying to refer to as multiculturalism is in fact the idea of cultural assimilation.As for the 'burqa,' it does not interfere with our culture, except that you find it confronting. Big deal. Its freedom of expression. If you want to be able to have it yourself, you can't deny it in others.
Alert moderator
18 May 2016 4:40:40pm@OnierosDid you say wearing a niqab is a freedom of expression?  So I got some questions:1) what sort of freedom are you talking about?2) how does somebody express themselves while wearing a big bag head to foot with little eye slits?Let's ask the women that are made to wear them If you cannot give a good answer then your comments are junkI've been told if women don't wear the big black ghost dress they run the risk of Severe Punishment. Maybe you could tell me if this is true
Alert moderator
18 May 2016 5:34:40pmWell first off, I don't know who's told you this, because they are, strictly speaking, wrong. But lets go through this, with the understanding that the overwhelming majority of women in Australia (the case is different in the Middle East) who wear the Niqab are doing it of their own volition.1) Freedom to express oneself through dress, speech, and adherence to religious belief where such adherence does not contradict Australian Law.2) The 'big bag' IS the expression. It is the expression of the most strict interpretation of the teachings of the Prophet. In essence, it is increasing the value of ones relationship with god by only showing ones face to him and to those one is related to. Besides which, a person can express themselves without showing their face. Look at this comments section.As for women being made to wear them, in Australia, the majority who wear them do so to adhere to a specific interpretation, a way to demonstrate ones holiness, in much the same way that walking around in bike leathers is a way to show people you own a motorcycle.In regards to punishment, the answer is not in Australia. In some areas of the Middle East a full burqa is expected, with those who deny it being considered somehow less pious, but severe punishment is not inherently related to failure to wear the Niqab.In all honesty, I do understand the suspicion of the Niqab. It is quite confronting, and very difficult to understand from our cultural perspective. But if you read, talk, and listen, you can quite easily learn to understand it, and numerous other cultural customs.

18 May 2016 2:47:26pmIndeed.Multiculturalism is more about cultural isolationism within a larger diverse society. You see it in many places around the world where certain cultural groups band together in localities and isolate themselves from the larger society.Diversity on the other hand has been an utter success story for Australia and many other nations because it is where people mix together in one huge melting pot of a society.ie. London suffers from Multiculturalism, whereas Edinburgh is incredibly diverse.

18 May 2016 2:50:38pmIt's difficult to measure but there's an estimated 300 women in Australia who wear a full veil. They're not all burqas but you're not the kind of person to be bothered with facts. There's probably some more who quickly fling one on to duck down the shops if they hadn't done their hair, couldn't be bothered putting make up on or are just having a fat day. Regardless of the reason, they aren't bothering you any more than your uncovered face might be bothering others of a more delicate nature.This is Australia and they can wear what they like...until such time as you raise, train and lead your fashion police. Don't forget to put some trendy tears in your jeans

19 May 2016 10:14:50amOnly the royal family can wear nazi uniforms. No-one said women in face coverings aren't being judged. No-one is saying that that they aren't doing themselves a colossal disservice by further distancing and alienating themselves from the general population. I've not heard anyone make a case that it is a good thing, a sensible thing, a wise thing or a harmonius thing. Women wear them for a wide variety of reasons, but the main one is that they feel naked without it. They feel uncomfortable and exposed without it. That's sad. I'm only glad that their daughters don't. In the meantime, like designer-torn jeans, tattoos, those big round ear rings that stretch the lobes and high heels with combat pants, I'll put it down to things that I think are stupid. But I wont condemn or belittle. They bear the social cost of such clothes. Not me

19 May 2016 12:16:18pmThe increasing level of polution in Sydney is so serious that many people are wearing a wide varity of face coverings in order to protect them selves from the dangerously noxious atmosphere. Wearing a full veil may offer a measure of protection against  the dangerous atmospheric enviroment.

19 May 2016 12:34:54pmYou need to ask the woman who wears the burka (or niqab or hijab) why she wears it. If she tells you that she wears it because she wants to reject other cultures in preference to her own, then your statement is correct. Otherwise it is an assumption.

18 May 2016 10:57:09amI agree entirely.We are what we are: a mix of "races" and cultures that have ended up in something we call "Australian".Who on earth would think that one ancestor, one "race", one tiny part of who we are, would define us?  What sort of racist would try to claim that one "race" was dominant and must be used to define a person and how they were treated by their fellow citizens?Who would seek to claim that there were two sorts of Australians, and even want to embed such a vision in the Constitution?Were I to claim that I was Irish, I would be laughed at and rightly so.  That my grandparents on one side were born in Ireland has little to do with who I am.  I have no need to wear a shamrock and insist that I be referred to as "of Irish descent".Thank heavens that such a ridiculous idea would never get traction in today's modern world, where we know that we cannot deny our full heritage, not even if we want to.

18 May 2016 1:23:47pmTabanus The Australian Constitution  drafted in 1901 and passed by the  British parliament set out the legal framework to unite the states and territories into a federation which did indeed establish our united identity to be known as Australians. However one group of Australians were excluded having no participation or say in the new nation being established on their land. They were  not included in the  final agreement. You really do have a nasty sting in your bite don't you, to muddy the waters in this way.
Alert moderator
18 May 2016 2:18:30pmDear marx spots the xI am not muddying the waters.I am stating quite clearly that to select one tiny fraction of one's genetic background and to state that determines how you must be treated is not only irrational but dangerous.  It is, beyond doubt racist to insist that because of a tenuous and often impossible to prove genetic link that a group must be treated differently by their fellow citizens.Don't we look at horror at the Nazi rules about "contamination with Jewish blood" through the generations?  Or the South African laws that decreed that "Blackness" was passed on, even if not visible to the naked eye?I say horror, but also with bemusement.  How could anyone believe something so stupid?  And then we have people proposing to incorporate something similar in our own society.I realise that when the Australian Constitution was debated and drafted it was felt that some "races" had to be treated differently.  I regret it was done that way, but it was long ago, and as someone else said, "Forgive them, they know not what they do".Today, we do know.  And I find it obnoxious and racist to try to insert clauses into our Constitution to promote the view that Australians can and should be divided by race.That you find this hard to accept is not my issue, but yours.

18 May 2016 7:06:57pmDear DoveWere that the case, people would not be delving further and further back into their genealogy liking for a ancestor to prove their aboriginality.I am quite aware of the difference between culture and "race", but many are not.For many, a single ancestor five generations ago is what defines them, not the culture in which they grew up.It is a bit like Pres. Obama identifying more with the father who had nothing to do with the child he fathered, and virtually ignoring the mother who bore him and the grandparents who raised him.I find it very odd, to pick something in your genetic material that has really nothing to do with who you are, and pronounce that those bits of DNA define you.

19 May 2016 11:11:03amTabanus, I find it equally bemusing that people will wear kilts to a wedding when they have but a distant ancestor from the glens. But people today can choose their identity. They can choose which aspect of their heritage that they wish to be a part of. I guess it's liberating for them. We don't rate people on a scale of pure blood or racial purity. People are no longer to termed half caste, quadroons or the like. People can choose which way they'll swing, and I'm not going to get in their way
Alert moderator
18 May 2016 3:54:46pmMarx, another way to look at constitutional recognition is as an acknowledgement of historical facts. The Australian continent was not unoccupied territory when it was claimed by Britain, but it took a few hundred years for the courts to arrive at a final view on the legal status of the land that was occupied by Britain. The constitution was written many years before that view was worked out, so it presupposes the old view, ie, that the land was terra nullius. It makes sense to incorporate in the constitution words that validate the chain of ownership from original inhabitants to British colonists and then the Australian people.Some people are fixated on the idea that constitutional recognition will divide Australians. Of course, that's absurd and, as you remarked, their views are often expressed in particularly nasty ways. Its really about having an explicit and clear statement about the basis on which we have built Australian society, without any doubts about how we came to possess the continent. That necessarily involves an acknowledgement that the British government took possession from the indigenous inhabitants. If the British government had concluded treaties with those inhabitants it would not be necessary, but that didn't happen. It really has very little to do with race.
Alert moderator
18 May 2016 1:53:09pmPutting Indigenous Australians in the constitution serves to act as a healing measure. By acknowledging that their culture was the one that was here first, we disown the concept of Terra Nullius in totality. It won't give them any new rights, except potentially codifying their land rights, it will just be closure, proof that their connection to the land really mattered.

19 May 2016 12:56:48pmI will concede the point. By the time that the Platypus was recognisable as such, it was likely in the Australian landmass. But I still contend that if you trace it back far enough, the ancestor of that ancestor would have come from other areas of the planet. I was trying to make a point about the essential unity of life.

18 May 2016 11:08:00amThank you for a well written, thoughtful article.Not to take away from anything the writer has said but could this article be summarised in 3 words: "It's all nonsense"?This is it really, isn't it?Our "identity", "nationality" or "who we are" is all nonsense. It's mildly interesting from a historical perspective but that's about it. All that happens is you get these gross generalisations that say because you are X you must be Y (and nobody really is sure what X or Y really is).At best it's some base human survival instinct where it's safer to identify with one's tribe but you'd think we could get beyond that now that we have Google. The problem is this base survival instinct has thrown up quite a few problems even in the past 100 years. It has resulted in the deaths of millions of people of all cultures, religions, ethnicities or whatever in every pocket of the world. There were at least 4 Genocides in the 20th century: the Armenian Genocide, the Holocaust, Rwanda and Bosnia. There were crimes against humanity in Cambodia, Sierra Leone and Darfur.Various South American dictators murdered and disappeared people.In South Africa we had apartheid.In the US black people were lynched. In Australia indigenous were persecuted and discriminated against and had their children stolen from them. In Ireland, the Protestants and the Catholics (who read the same book for god sake) killed each other. There's even a terrorist group in Wales (I don't think they've ever done anything).In Saudi Arabia today to be a woman is to be a second class citizen.And back in Australia today we treat refugees coming by boat as if they are not the same type of human being as the rest of us. Bad things happen when we divide people up into groups which is why we should avoid it. So if you're tempted to do it - stop and think of the consequences. History shows that it only ends in one way.

Subsequent border changes were then made by the national leaders.But even supposing local leaders did play a role in the borders, that would likely not have helped, as the smaller sects like the kurds would still be the minority, and ignored, whilst those with more immediate power would have dominate discussions, and carved out territory they had no claim to.If I am wrong, give me a credible citation to the contrary.

18 May 2016 2:49:54pmas a note on history the borders in that region have little relationship to the 'line in the sand' drawn by Sykes and Picot as the national borders were in fact a result of many years of negotiations between the actual nations concerned after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.

It's mildly interesting from a historical perspective but that's about it."I think this is going too far the other way.Even if the concept of nation-states was eroded to dust (which I think is a worthy goal for the future), tribal identities would still exist and have meaning for many people.It is similar to religion: people refer to their ancestors to explain why they act or think certain things. Some derive a considerable amount of pride and self-esteem from that knowledge. For them, this isn't mildly interesting, it is quite important. Good for them, I say.I see no real harm in people celebrating and acknowledging their heritage. The danger is when they take it too far so that the different and the new becomes 'wrong' or 'bad' while the traditional and the old becomes 'correct' or 'good'. That's where the trouble begins and the various atrocities you list happen.The reality is that the middle ground of simultaneously celebrating our differences and our shared humanity is hard and complex.There was a time when we did some things not because they were easy, but because they were hard.I fear those times are gone and may not come back because of:1. A dearth of political leadership;2. A 24 hour news cycle;3. A pace of life that is fast and getting faster so that we focus more and more on the day to day, rather than planning for the future.

18 May 2016 1:52:06pmI don't think it's going too far. I think we need to accept it for what it is or else we cannot properly embrace it (and deal with the much bigger problems down the line). It's nonsense. I like football (real football). Football is nonsense. A group of people came up with arbitrary rules that said you could only have 11 players on each team, 10 of which couldn't use their hands and one could within a certain area. How is that not total nonsense?Does it stop me from enjoying or appreciating it?No. I don't need to have meaning to enjoy something. Things just are. Does it really need to be more complicated than that?Now there is a slightly more interesting thing going on here. There is of course the issue of the allocation of resources which will almost certainly involve "me first".This is my big concern. What we are seeing with the refugee crisis could be the start of something pretty bad. Things are not going to get easier with climate change and so we better start putting our collective thinking caps on.The starting point when there is less land and more people will need to be how are we going to manage this process?Will we huddle together in tribes?Or will we co-operate? Because when we are dealing with a global crisis on that scale quaint ideas of nationality and identity are not going to be much use.

18 May 2016 3:40:28pm"Will we huddle together in tribes?Or will we co-operate?"Global co-operation is hard.Huddling together in self-interested tribes is easy. May only the strong survive.I think attempting to solve global issues by asking people to set aside their parochial concerns will, ironically, make it harder for a global response to be achieved.That's not to say that nationalistic concerns should trump the global concerns. But it would be counter productive to attempt to ignore them altogether.I think they would have to be factored in to any global solution.

Some people can't because of their mental state (depression), others because they lack a sense of humor, or at leas a good one.6-I don't think many people get offended easily, but often when one brushes off enough things that are slightly offensive, it piles up and becomes an issue.7-I can't think of a single culture that doesn't at least preach respect for truth and honesty. But once again, a canny leader can find loopholes in anything.

18 May 2016 3:34:32pmTaqiyya? Are you serious? Taqiyya is a Shi'ite concept whereby it is better to lie about being a Shi'ite than it is to be killed. Sinister stuff. Some Sunni schools have rulings on it but it's about as obscure as quoting the writings of Aquinas and claiming all Christians believe in them. The only use of the idea that I have ever come across is that it's better to break tenants of Islam than die. For example, it's better to eat a ham sandwich than starve to death.What do you think it means, and who told you that?
Alert moderator
18 May 2016 3:54:35pmMuslim scholars teach that Muslims should generally be truthful to each other, unless the purpose of lying is to "smooth over differences."There are several forms of lying to non-believers that are permitted under certain circumstances, the best known being taqiyya. These circumstances are typically those that advance the cause of Islam - in some cases by gaining the trust of non-believers in order to draw out their vulnerability and defeat them.

18 May 2016 4:17:52pmCamL, you didn't tell me where you're getting this from? I've heard a lot of sermons, I've spoken to a lot of scholars and I'm a moderately well read person myself, and until the anti-Muslim bridge brought this up about five or so years ago, and it became a frequent topic on the hate sites, I had never heard of that context or meaning. Up until 9/11 I had never, ever heard of the so-called virgins in heaven. And I've never met another Muslim who had either. There are vast reams of scripture in every ancient religion. In the last 15yrs people with a motive to denigrate and even incite have gone out of their way to find and distort anything and everything that they can. It would be like St Peter at the Pearly Gates, Angels dancing on the heads of pins or Noah's Ark and claiming that these were firmly held views. Whilst I'm typing, the Qur'an describes wars. It doesn't advocate them. I details executions, it doesn't command them. Best check some of these findings with actual Muslims. If you tell me you think that they're lying then I guess we're at an impasse

19 May 2016 1:02:01pmIf you picked up a Quran you would know it.The essential statements on lying indicate that it is wrong, but can be utilised to prevent a greater wrong. Its a less absolutist and more relativistic view on the act, that it can be used for good.The quintessential example of this use for good is to deny belonging to a sect to preserve ones life, or even break tenets of Islam if that is required, to preserve the lives of many. On the other hand, hateful lying, such as gossip, slander, libel, rumour, and spiteful words, are all condemned most strongly.Of course, the actual interpretation of this varies from cleric to cleric. Some impose more absolutist views of lying, whilst others are much more relativistic, but the core tenets are the same.

18 May 2016 4:41:59pm1-Entirely dependent on what one considers an Australian to be.2-I never said it was. I said that if they left nations under non-democratic systems, then the appeal of democracy was a likely factor. By the way, Sharia law is not an explicit set of rules, and its interpretation is down to individual clerics.4-Actually, many passages of the Quran speak of respectful behaviour, and denounce violence, gossip, lying, as well as respecting the right of one not to hold the Islamic faith. However, like all holy books, there is room for interpretation, and other passages that can be used to contradict.7-Someone else gave a much better answer then I could have.

18 May 2016 12:49:29pm@CamLThere aren't many Australians by your definition then since the last four on your list are rare as hen's teeth in modern Australia - particularly all four in one individual.I'm not sure the first is a good judgement call either - are you honestly saying that non-English speaking indigenous Australians aren't really Australian? That's just one example of the flaw in that logic, there are plenty of others.Not sure the second one applies either - we've had communists, fascists and others who I'd consider Australian (though I don't share their views in the least) and in fact we're a constitutional monarchy not a direct democracy so the point is debatable at the very least.The third one is kind of difficult too since modern Australia sprung mostly from convict settlements and it seems to mean that anyone with a criminal conviction is no longer Australian. It also rules out all those people who claim that speeding fines are revenue raising - so quite a lot of Australians there.Respect for your fellow man (not for women too?) is not a universal Australian trait by any stretch of the imagination given Australian's history in terms of non-British migrants and indigenous Australians. Or for that matter our current treatment of refugees.Being able to laugh at yourself isn't a particularly Australian trait either - just watch the outrage if you make fun of the absurd latter day ritual of Anzac day and the way it's become commercialized and politicized beyond all recognition.Not being offended easily is definitely off the list too - large numbers of Australians of all kinds seem to go out looking to be offended and outraged. Just look at the number of viewers of Today Tonight or A Current Affairs.Finally being honest and truthful is definitely not what being Australian is about - we've always respected those who can spin a good yarn or talk BS well. Not only that but we've long been a nation of many frauds and tax cheats.Why don't we just keep it simple and say Australians are people who have (or are at least entitled to) Australian citizenship?

18 May 2016 2:00:00pmThe only points I take issue with are numbers 1 and 6.In regards to number one, there are many Australians who can't speak English through disability. As such, this needs qualifiers. I would say that for someone to be Australian, they must, where able, try to learn to speak English.In regards to number six, I would say that what offends one person may not offend another. It is a very personal metric. Rather, how one responds to being offended is more important. I would say that the most Australian response is to take the piss out of the one doing the offending, or otherwise dispute or debate them. But once again, that's just me.

18 May 2016 2:59:20pmDo we start retracting citizenship for people in a coma?Any set of supposed character traits required to qualify for national identity quickly become ludicrous when you look at them carefully. Usually they are just some extension of personal vanity. How is some brand of a sense of humour supposed to be a sign of Australianness? Have some of you never talked to an Irishman? Never been to Scotland? Most of the world's best stand up comedians are English or American, not Aussies.And as for some Australian-type of response to being offended, we get as easily offended as anyone else. The triggers may be different but the responses are pretty much the same as in another hundred other countries. Just go visit an emergency ward on a Saturday night, those people in their seeking treatment weren't hit by a cutting witticism.

18 May 2016 5:16:23pmI agree with you. But my experience has always been that it is best to humor people like this and use that to guide them into better modes of thinking, rather then issue them a complete rebuttal. Really, I think national identity is too complex an issue to be put in simple categories or boxes; but if I can get someone to start changing their mind, I classify that as a good result.

18 May 2016 12:06:03pmAll you can say is, if you are born here, you are an Australian, we are an immigration nation.   On a lot of occasions, the establishment, is the entrenched wealthy set, business, politicians, law people who control society.   When they get comfortable, they fail to see the new kids on the block,  and dismiss them if they wont adhere to their way of thinking.   History is littered with these situations, that are moments that have changed history, business, nations, trade, law, when someone finds a new way of doing something and they sweep away the old norm, such as the internet has done.   People in society do not like change, but change is always going on around us, we have to be aware of it.   And that is life you have to expect change is always happening, it is how you read change, and how you accept change, that defines you as, a person who adapts and moves on, or you rail against change.    You only have to look at established religion, how it has faded when modern politics took over the role, of making laws for society to abide by, that control how we live, learn, our relationships, our workplace.  Really the song American Pie, sums it up so well, I went do the sacred store, the music was no more,  the church bells, all were broken, the Father - Son, and Holy Ghost caught the last train to the coast, a generation had lost it's faith in the church.  The same applies to royalty who a bit over 100 years ago, ruled most of Europe, were all related, but set the continent ablaze, and people could not accept the outcome, and had a second go at it, and made a real mess.If you want to look at Nations of similar beginnings, you only have to look at Canada, and the U.S. as ourselves former colonies of the U.K.   And as the world becomes more connected, borders become harder to define people, as business now can be done on a Global scale, from an office anywhere in the world selling goods and services into any number of countries.   The only countries who can really afford a strong military army, are a few countries as they are so big, they have the capacity to stay at the forefront of military technology, even NATO would struggle with a small war, given, they have tried to combine many countries with one treaty, however each Government is responsible for it's own military spending.   These are issues Governments are not talking about,   as individuals set up businesses that are not constrained by borders.   Even Governments cannot handle the pace of change, and they choose to ignore the fact they cannot control those companies to pay taxes.   The challenge for our political people, is that they want to stay where they are, as they feel comfortable with that way of life, however they are blind to changes even in society such as same sex relationships, which they can't stop, but wont allow to marry.   You have to open your eyes and your mind.

18 May 2016 3:30:08pmNo, not my intention at all.   Your story is what I was saying, because this is an immigration nation, most families are made up of mixed nationalities, such as my own family.    The way of the world, is that people now move around so much, in the connected world we live in, it is hard to say what makes us Australian, is it someone who has generations of family here, is it new arrived citizens, is it defined by the landmass we live on ?    When you arrived does not worry me.   My family arrived as you did from other countries.   My point is, though it is getter harder to say who is a TYPICAL Australian, as that is ever changing.   So I went for a broader answer, and the answer is, it is broader then that I have said. It is easy for people to misunderstand, someone would ask you, where did you come from, before you made Australia your home, then once you tell them your story, it does not worry most people it is more a conversation piece,   Australians will accept you, and be glad you chose to live here.   My point is life does not stop,  at borders of countries any more, which not all that long ago, did happen.     Which makes it hard not from my personal perspective, but from the broader sense of defining what it means to be an Australian.   That is how I read the original piece.

19 May 2016 12:20:57pmOk, cool. I'm coming from the point that the writer was getting at, that you and only you can define who you are and it is not based on any concrete thing like where you were born or where your parents came from. So one's identity is self-constructed. The problem becomes when others come across your self-construction and say 'no, you cannot identify as this or that, because you have not fulfilled some random criteria'.

Lets start by removing all race from our legal documents and removing all multicultural grants.  Lets put assistance to where it is needed, regardless of someones defined heritage.

Who we are is inexorably tied up with our parents and we desire to know about our ancestry.The sad part is that some people think so little of themselves that their claim to superiority is "how rich my dad is" or "How powerful my dad is" or "My father was nobility" and if you lack any outstanding feature in your lineage ... how my race and ancestry s better than yours.

19 May 2016 6:33:29amA "true" Australian is a white Australian, as simple as that. Everyone else is just a resident in Australia.There is a reason why Australia is a first world country and not a third world hellhole. It is because our country was established by WASPs and has a European (predominantly British) culture and institutions. Nobody wants to emmigrate to to non-Caucasian country. (Political) Refugees are supposed to head to the nearest safe country, but in reality these leeches all make a beeline for the Caucasian country with the most welfare benefits. When I went to primary school in the late 70s and ealry 80s, all of the kids in  my class were Caucasian, and very few were of non-British ancestry.  People knew what an Australian was back then; we had a well defined national identity because we ethnically homogenous. In order for a state to be strong and stable , it must have a large, powerful ethnic majority that is proud of itself, and isn't afraid to assert it's values.But was 45 years of indiscriminate immigration, Australia no longer has a concrete identity. The lefty elite are constantly belittling Caucasians and their European derived culture, values and traditions.

18 May 2016 1:21:58pmIf your ancestors have been here for 40,000 years you are an indigenous Australian.If your ancestors arrived here from 1788 and after, to  about the mid 20th century, you are a native Australian.If your only parents were born here you are a new Australian.If you were born overseas you are an immigrant Australian.All have the same rights and freedoms.However, only the first 2 groups can actually say they have ancestors that have  built the institutions and infrastructure, defended the nation in times of crisis and determined the ideals that define the nation. These are the things that made Australia such an outstanding country, one that all the others wanted to come to and be part of.The next 2 groups now have the opportunity to help the country become even better. If they remain her for generations, their descendants will be native Australians.

18 May 2016 2:13:58pmInteresting comments - I would say the first group didnt exactly build the institutions and infrastructure, but rather were excluded and continue to be victims of second.  The second group are descended from people who came here after 1788.  A lot of them probably helped build the infrastructure but very few of them would have had a hand in building the institutions (more of a top down ruling class approach for that).  But does give their descendants bragging rights and a special place here? I mean, YOU didn't fight in Galipoli, or build the Snowy River or start the Union movement, so why are you any more special than somebody fresh off the boat?

18 May 2016 1:44:44pm"What does it mean to be Australian?"A question that can never have anything more than a vague answer, but a good start would be to assume it means tolerance, the 'fair go', respect for our institutions and equality of the sexes. To the extent anyone (newcomer or not) holds these values, they're Australian.The problem arises when generalisations about those coming from non-Anglo cultures are used to presume one's adherence to the definition of an Australian. As an example, the strict Muslim, taking the Koran and hadiths literally with concepts like the dissimulation of taqiyaa, support for Sharia (even in its milder forms) and the treatment of women as chattels is unlikely to support 'Australian' values, or ever be considered 'Australian'. The moderate Muslim, who rejects these ideas (to the extent it can be done while still calling oneself a Muslim) is as Australian as anybody else. Debating these definitions in a calm, rational manner is what's required - but we rarely see this today with the arguments on both sides hijacked by those with more extreme views. So no, where you're born has nothing to do with your ability to be 'Australian'. Rather, the values you display in your daily life will dictate how you're perceived. Avoidance behaviour when it comes to discussing what it means to be a Muslim in Australia is rife, and merely creates a vacuum into which divisive, extreme points of view dominate. Both sides have a responsibility to discuss these things, unencumbered by polarising advocates on either side. The media have a role to play here, and thus far, haven't really stepped up to the mark - instead, people like Andrew Bolt and Sheikh Hilaly get more airtime.

18 May 2016 1:51:03pmToo easy - it's like families - you are the son or daughter of your parents, the ones who made you.  You can change parents through adoption and become an adopted child.  Likewise you are the son or daughter of the country you were born into but you can change this by adopting another, providing the adoptive country, like adoptive parents, wants to adopt you.  You can't just appear from wherever and claim to be the adopted child of people who don't know you or want you, or whose family values and customs you do not honour or respect.  Australians are the people born here before or after the country known as Australia came into existence with Federation in 1901, OR who want to become Australians AND have been adopted as Australians by other Australians.  Everyone else is something else.As far as being "a country of immigrants" goes this is pure rubbish - every country on earth except the one part of Africa our descendants all came from is just as much a country of immigrants.  It's just that some people's descendants have changed countries more than others.

18 May 2016 1:51:58pm"Who am I" ? and "Who are you" ? "Where did you come from" ? "How did you end up here" ? So many questions...I guess I can answer just about all the questions about race, origin, etc., with one word: "Africa". Interestingly, I often wonder what happened to the Neanderthals? They can't just simply vanished without a trace. Given the fact that the Homo Sapiens and the Neanderthals actually co-extisted for quite some time, surely a young amigo from either side, with hormone running out of control, would have had a bit of "Inter-racial" encounter? It is proven that we have traces of the Neanderthals in us. No really surprising.SO the modern humans that we are, are finding it hard to co-exist, just like the days when the two very primitive branches of humanities roaming the earth. Ideologies, economic interests, national interests, etc. formed the core for conflicts. Then of course there are the sh*t stirrer who make it their life ambitions to cause trouble for everyone.Tracing back to one's ancestry will probably dig up some interesting facts, some of us welcome the surprises with open arms, some would reject the new found facts because they don't fit their narratives, like Pauline Hanson claiming a violent sex act a long time ago !There was a very wild man by the name of Jack Van Tongeren in WA. He belonged to an extreme right wing mob who thrived on causing troubles to Asians. What was interesting, as some enterprising journalists managed to dig out, was that his ancestry actually came from Indonesia ! So there you go !

18 May 2016 2:19:50pmSo now we have a former clown, jack of all traders and adult shop "sex shop?" worker defining "Australian" by claiming it has no real definition? Really?The only reason diverse culture people have received awards recently is mere fashion and the activism by the social engineering and artistic sectors. Waleed Ali?, a fashionable choice. A white anglo australian with a similar of level of skill would not even get near the short list.I couldn't see you searching for traces of alien DNA in other cultural blocs. White countries fair game? Evidently. Cultural Marxism social justice warriorism rears it's zealous head again.It has to be stated clearly: Multiculturalism is a policy that strives to unite people by the fact they have nothing in common. Think about that for a moment. Even Josef Goebbels couldn't conceive or sell such an inherently contradictory notion.Mixing the lower cultures with the white western capitalist patriarchy is basically a waste of time and money for the dominant world culture.Sunil, if you're so proud of your Indian heritage why not mount an expeditionary force to India to solve it's embarrassing cultural and structural problems? I had high hopes for India's future prospects, then I realised the corruption, rape culture and general filth and dysfunction rules it out.BTW, I've employed Indians and have had good Indian friend, with no real problems. But they are fully anglicized, and basically see their fellow countrymen as embarrassing, parasitic and backward.

18 May 2016 2:50:51pmI assume that by not being a former clown (interpretations vary as to whether I currently moonlight as one, but that's another matter), a jack of all traders (Huh?) or an adult shop worker, that I can intercede at this point and take up where Sunil was going before he disqualified himself. Putting an authentic, Western, legitimate sheen to the argument if you like.Australia and Australians. Well, really, where to begin.It's uniquely a continent and also a country, and struggles to make a decent fist of doing either well.It's a nation which proudly displays another country's symbol on its own, and then goes off in a completely different direction and relies on yet another for all its defence needs.It's less a nation of the world and more a useful piece of counterbalancing rock that stops the whole planet from tipping over. In days of yore it was not so much a destination as a welcome piece of land for brave and adventurous explorers to get off rolling and pitching decks of three-masted sailing ships and stretch their legs and have a wee. It was (and remains) a conveniently-situated roadhouse with some great beaches.It's the natural home for the entire world's irony. Nowhere else could you create people who prized being "bronzed Aussies" at the same time they were actively pursuing a White Australia Policy.I also have little doubt that the first Aboriginals who ended up here about 40,000 years (or whatever) ago were industrious and cutting-edge people on the cusp of inventing everything from the wheel to space travel, and in a few short generations decided it was all too much bother. I suspect that because in only a few short generations the white people here have evolved to the stage where defining yourself as a nomad is now about the highest honour you can achieve, and wandering the traditional paths telling stories and rabbiting-on is the pinnacle of a life well lived. In the end this is a place where the land moulds the people; not the other way around.Not so much a nation of people as such, it's a homeland for the intangibles. It's where stupidity can dwell safely and have a place it can call home. It's where human ambition and curious thought goes to die. It's a valuable theme park where other peoples of the world can come and marvel at folk who care not a jot about important things, but will happily work themselves into a lather about trivialities. It's an important and salient reminder to them of what can happen when you let your standards slip.

19 May 2016 7:29:45am@jack III'll say it:The White Australia policy was a terrible and bloody stupid thing - it crippled our economy and society as well as putting us in the same category that most of the civilized world put South Africa in under Apartheid.Worse still it became not only a White Australia policy but a British Australia policy since for many decades most Europeans were considered not to be white by it.As for healthy tans - no such thing really, a tan is a response to too much UV and regular tanning leads to skin cancer.You want a return to the White Australia days? Fine. Wave goodbye to your standard of living, to Australia having any growth whatsoever and start to enjoy the short slide back towards being an insular and xenophobic nation that celebrates mediocrity and small minded thinking.ps Criticizing your country isn't "Cultural Marxism" mate, if anything it's more Australian than your BS nationalist sentiment of "My country, right or wrong" that is all too European or American.

18 May 2016 3:47:17pmI have always been on my guard when reading an article like this, which tries to deny our history, our individual past and heritage of true Australians.You wonder what is the true motive of this author when he tries to trivialize our past, our national origin, or the origin of our parents and ancestors. Why is it so hard for some "immigrant nationalities" to accept their past, their heritage, and their origin? Instead they appear just too eager to wrap themselves in Australian flag?First of all, the very notion of "an immigrant nation" is an artificial construct of recent times. In a way it can be deemed as an oxymoron to state publicly that there is a such thing an "immigrant nation". If Nation means anything it means stability, a foundation, an identity that had evolved over a very long time, a very long time living together in a close community.So a nation cannot be created by governments in a manner of setting different kinds of people on the same territory in a state of perpetual economic competition among each other.He says: "our Australianness isn't and shouldn't be determined by any one aspect of our identity, least of all where we or our parents "really" came from."He should also have added: "our Australianness is determined by what or who our fellow Australians think we are .... not only by what we think of ourselves to be!"

18 May 2016 4:09:54pmThe definition of being Australian given here is one that is so broad that being Australian can mean anything and everything, so therefore it means nothing. This I disagree with.I reject the idea that there are no significant differences between countries and cultures. I find it to be braindead. We are a western nation, with our own particular history, character and culture and i think to be Australian is to identify with that.Its funny, many people seem to think its "racist" to be concerned about our national identity and culture dissolving until you mention American influence...then the same people are suddenly on your side.
Alert moderator
18 May 2016 5:39:47pm"...then the same people are suddenly on your side"Really?I'd put it to you that if you can't identify the clear and obvious distinction between people from outside this nation influencing it with their transmitted ideas and customs, and people already legitimately resident within this country influencing it by their very presence, then I doubt very much you know a great deal about anything that's occurring around you at present.And for the record (just to give one brief, tangential example - I won't waste undue time on lost causes), the existing Federal Parliament currently has one openly homosexual Liberal Party member already in it, and a second due after the upcoming election. If I may be so bold as to speak on behalf of your parents and grandparents and their respective generations, you - and others like you - already live in a place where their "culture" and their "character" have been effectively trashed. Whatever "culture" and "character" you think you're defending is in reality a moving feast which has managed to overrun previous versions whilst you stood around watching, so I wouldn't place any great store in whatever current definition you might happen to think you're taking up arms to protect.

18 May 2016 4:30:33pmIt was discovered today that owing to an oversight in the wording of the constitution, only people granted citizenship by the Department of Immigration are legally Australian citizens, as well as aboriginals who were granted citizenship by the 1968 referendum.Everyone else will be removed from Australian soil until the government can make other arrangements. Immigration Minister Dutton said that everyone would have the opportunity to apply for citizenship through the proper channels and ultimately it was at the Ministers discretion as to whether a person was of good character.The shadow minister for immigration was unavailable for comment as he is in detention.

18 May 2016 7:25:49pmI would agree with the author.Being called an Australian means absolutely nothing.There is no culture or soul any longer in this country, and Australia is now a mishmash of nothingness.A total lack of identity is now the epitome of an Australian.Although most people in Australia are simply human cattle that are born and breed (or imported in as immigrants) to act as consumers, workers and mortgage fodder for the banks.Worse still is when so many immigrants are highly (or completely) urbanized, and have no connection to nature or connection to the Australian countryside at all.And as more immigrants are brought in, there is less and less nature and Australian countryside left.

18 May 2016 9:45:48pmMigrants arriving in Australia over the past 60 years have brought Australia into the 21st century as a technologically advanced modern nation. Australia has been very selective of its migrants over the past decades, allowing mainly well-qualified professional or skilled people into the country. Therefore the average migrant was more sjkilled and intelligent than the average Australian who had been here for several generations. It is not a fluke that two of the three of our last PMs were born out side of Australia. Also, the current opposition leader's father was born outdide Australia. Many of our top spoertsmen and women today, eg Kyrgios and Tomic and Gadilova are from migrant families.  Before the 1960s, Australia was a relatively backward country dependent on coal, iron-ore and wool exports for its wealth. Fortunately that wealth tempted migrants with talent and qualifications. So today, Australia is a great country. Instead of treating 'new Australians' as second class citizens, perhaps it is the Australians who have been here a long time who should be treated as freeloaders and be shipped off to the countries their ancestors came from (mainly the UK). The migrants are the true Australians who have made this ciountry what it is today.

19 May 2016 12:15:00amI think in our minds we each imagine 'Australian' as something different. I'd say the main point of this article is that we should accept those that label themselves as Australian, as Australian, and not use some form of exclusive criteria to argue that they are in fact not. It is also meant to challenge our thinking at those times when we make assumptions that someone is or is not Australian based on how they look, talk, dress and behave. We all have a right to our own identity and how we label that identity. We all carry many labels, and these, including our national identities, may change over the course of our lifetimes.Every person, each with their own unique personality and beliefs, has the right to live somewhere on this earth. To me this does not imply the need to assimilate all of the values and beliefs dominant in a particular place. Disagreement with certain laws or the popular policies of a place does not mean that a person must disassociate themself from that place. If you went back in time before women and people indigenous to the Austraian continent could vote, and communicated your beliefs that women and indigenous people should have the right to vote in Australia, many people may have considered you to be un-Australian then. Change happens when people express opinions and beliefs that differ from the mainstream, and when those opinions gain popular traction. To aspire to assimilation is to reject change.Australia and Australian identity is not static. It is ever changing. When people say that someone, their practices, or the beliefs they hold are not Australian, I think they are also saying or feeling (perhaps on a subconscious level): 'I don't want that person to be considered and accepted as Australian', 'that person does not represent the Australia I know', 'this person represents a changed Australia that I don't want to happen'. But Australia is a very young country - especially dwarfed by the long history of the indigenous people who are the traditional owners of this land. Relatively speaking, Australia as a country is only at the beginning of its journey. Its identity is rapidly changing. We are shaping change every day. In the context of this relatively short history, during which time Australia has changed so much I would think that there is room to accept many different identities as Australian.

19 May 2016 12:19:36pmBeing "Australian" to me, a fourth generation Australian, means accepting Australia as your home and contributing to the social fabric of the country. I would prefer, however, that we dropped the labels altogether and just rremember we are all on this small rock spinning in space among many other rocks doing the same thing. We should call ourselves simply human beings if we need a label and we should also accept that everyone has the ability and the capacity to fit in anywhere given time and experience.There is no real "Aussie type" there are many types of people who make up the richness of our social and cultural existence and none of them are any better or worse than any other. My own background is a mongrel mixture of German, Irish, English, Scottish and Danish, and might parents were born here in Australia as were three of my grandparents, but before them there are a mix of countries of origin from Ireland, Germany and England. I would suggest my experience and my background is probably mirrored by a great many Australian residents.What makes an Australian? Someone who lives in Australia is my answer. It is a bit like the attitude we get from small country towns, like the one I live outside, "are you a local?" they ask, and I say, "Yes I am." Then it's the same old ridiculous, "But you came here six years ago." And I answer, "That's true, but I now live here so I am a local, just like everyone else who chooses to live here." (Incidentally I was actually born locally but my family left here when I was a child.)I then wonder if the person from Delhi or Athens or London goes back for a visit whether they are treated as foreigners or just returned locals. In my experience they are treated like returning locals. Even my wife, who was born in England, was treated as a returning local in England even though she left there before the age of two.So let's forget the idea that we are Australian because we were born here and think about something told to me when I was a teenager when I scoffed at an older man who told me in his strong Dutch accent he was an Australian. I told him, "But you're Dutch, not Australian." He simply said, "I am Dutch by an accident of birth, I am an Australian by choice, I have the document to prove it."
