With one week left in the federal election campaign, Prime Minister John Howard has ramped up his media commitments - but not without some prodding.Mr Howard has been accused of running a slow-paced campaign - often having just one media event a day, compared to a handful attended by Labor leader Kevin Rudd.After one quick media opportunity in outer Sydney this morning, Mr Howard again copped a grilling from journalists about his limited campaigning."I've got plenty of other things to do today," he said.And so the Prime Minister made a hasty change of plans, letting the travelling media tag along to a couple of afternoon events which he had hoped to attend away from the media glare.Both events targeted the strong Chinese Australian presence in his Sydney seat of Bennelong.First he visited a Chinese shopping centre, then he handed out awards at a ceremony at a local Chinese language school.
