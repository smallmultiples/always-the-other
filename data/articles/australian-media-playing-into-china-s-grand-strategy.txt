China's leadership clearly has a desire to extend its soft power in the West through co-operation deals with local media organisations. And Australia is right in the thick of it, writes Bill Birtles.Six years ago, as a foreign editor working inside the belly of China's state-run media behemoth Xinhua, I was asked to attend a meeting.On the upper floors of the company's distinctive pencil-shaped tower in south-west Beijing, I was greeted by a boardroom-style table and a group of middle-management types.They noted that I had previously worked at the ABC, and that Aunty now had multiple digital television channels to fill with content.So they asked me whether it might be possible for Xinhua's new television service to air in Australia on one of those channels.Aside from the unlikeliness of the proposition, what struck me at the time was how amateur their approach was.Getting a young foreign editor from the newsroom to be their intermediary to contact Australia's national broadcaster reflected how little experience these state-media managers had dealing with foreign companies.Yet six years on, like so many things in China, the progress of the government's overseas media push is rapid.In the past week, a senior Chinese propaganda official Liu Qibao capped off a successful two-day visit to Australia that included meeting the Governor-General and signing agreements or MOUs with several media organisations.The most significant achievement was the announcement that Fairfax's main newspapers - The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and The Australian Financial Review, would distribute China Watch - a fully paid monthly eight-page supplement straight from the China Daily, its state-PR machine.Fairfax has defended the deal as a "commercial printing arrangement", and points out that papers around the world, such as the Washington Post, also distribute China Watch.But China's colossal PR machine doesn't just have struggling newspapers in its sights.The ABC's 2014 deal with provincial-level Shanghai Media Group (SMG) paved the way for a rare coup - the establishment of a China-based website for the ABC's international Australia Plus service.The difficulty of obtaining a .cn portal underlines the significance of a Chinese-language service that potentially reaches tens, if not hundreds of millions of people.But as Media Watch recently pointed out, the site had been caught self-censoring ABC news stories, and the ABC maintains it isn't supposed to carry news at all.More questionable is that the Australia Plus Chinese portal replaced the online Radio Australia Chinese service, which routinely published stories that wouldn't make the cut under China's tight censorship regime.These types of co-operation agreements are just a taste of what's to come.Recently, Australian journalists in Beijing were asked to a meeting with officials from the State Council Information Office.The meeting was off-the-record, but it was clear that finding further ways to push media co-operation with Australian outlets is a priority.For China, there has long been a great insecurity about a deficiency of soft power on the global stage, and changing the "negative" tone of how China is covered in the Western media is a goal.In the past, propaganda officials have suggested a UN-style body to regulate the world's media organisations so they promote "fairness" in their reporting.And just this week, China's Premier Li Keqiang told an alliance of 30 news editors from across Asia to promote "an optimal environment for peace and prosperity", according to the China Daily.For Australia, the way news organisations engage with state-run counterparts from a country with media values that are anathema to Australian notions of freedom of speech, is just one of the tricky aspects of the Australia-China relationship.For China, the hope is that increasing co-operation deals will eventually lead to influence that can reshape the way Australian journalists report on China, in a way more agreeable to the leaders in Beijing.The question Australian news companies must ask themselves is whether they are willing to play a part in that.Bill Birtles is the ABC's China correspondent.

Comments for this story are closed.03 Jun 2016 8:23:29amAh, but in corporate Australia what matters is profits. So a successful China plan to use one (or more) of the ABC digital TV channels may be possible if the Neolibs have their way with decreasing funding for the ABC, and push the corporation into getting revenues from China through digital TV.... I can see Rupert salivating at the potential prospect of him getting the ABC first and then striking the deals with the Chinese, thus finally opening the Chinese markets to his empire.... something that has eluded him so far.All of the above is plausible if the Liberals are returned, it's far less likely if the ALP wins government.

03 Jun 2016 9:27:22amI'm salivating at the prospect of Rupert getting hold of the ABC too.  He could easily cut its budget by 50% and achieve the same output.  He'd also implement editorial balance.  So rather than:- having so-called panels where a bunch of lefties agree with each other, he might insist on having a conservative viewpoint presented- catholics excoriated at every opportunity, perhaps say, muslims might receive the same treatment- allowing ABC journals to indulge in their obsessions with climate change, CSG and same sex marriage, the cost of living might get a run occasionally

03 Jun 2016 10:24:05amIs this satire?Rupert would implement editorial balance?  Hahahaha... like on Fox News perhaps?Have you watched Q&A?  My view is that the panel is always quite well balanced.As for climate change, CSG and SSM, these are all issues important to the Australian public.  Sure, have a robust debate about the cost of living in Australia as well, but I have a good idea who would lose out in such a debate.

We did get TV for free and had to put up with advertisements. Now many pay for it and have to put up with advertisements.The telephone system worked well but now the privately run NBN is causing all soughts of problems. (TEs i know Tax payer funded)The workers were paid a good salary with bonuses and now the world  economy is slowing due to private and public debt. The only organisations growing are those that have lobbied governments and now the governments are in huge amounts of debt.TO have debt you must have an equal in credit. So where is that credit.

03 Jun 2016 2:23:23pmQ: "TO have debt you must have an equal in credit."A: A banks balance sheet. And in turn the perceived worth of a share in the said bank which in part determines the price of the said share.Though keep in mind that the assets of the bank can evaporate as quickly as fractional reserve banking can create the perceived wealth of the bank in the first instance.Never forget "price is what you pay, value is what you get."Which is why I would be withdrawing money from any bank/property investments in China and moving them into safe haven investments.

03 Jun 2016 11:38:31amOMG.  If this is a serious post you have been completely hoodwinked in believing that the ABC has less balance than Uncle Rupert's outlets.  Obviously facts are something you disregard unless they support your views and beliefs. If you think the cost of living does not get a mention then you do not watch (or pay attention) to most of the news or current affairs programs on the ABC.  But, in your defence, you are entitled to your opinion and even get the opportunity to post it on an ABC website.

03 Jun 2016 2:55:12pmApologies oz in hk.  You actually have a point.  Communism, in its intent, was actually all about wealth distribution.  Sadly, it has never been implemented as intended anywhere because it is easily corrupted by human tendencies for individual power seeking.  Ironically, this is a large part of the reason top-down economics doesn't work.  It relies too much on those at the top who to do their civic duty which is counter to the psychology of those most likely to find themselves at the "top" in the first place.  Ipso-facto, wealth concentration rather than dissemination. QED: Top-down economics doesn't work.  So why are we going to elect a government that uses this failed theory?

03 Jun 2016 2:11:17pmJoeBloggs, to illustrate the nature of your work is your statement:"... .the US State Dept spokesperson got annoyed with a RT reporters badgering?"I referred simply to "a journalist". Have you evidence that the journalist I referred to was from RT? If so, please provide it. As to what the US is doing when it breaches Syrian airspace, it requires Syrian government approval to do so.

03 Jun 2016 2:39:40pm"As to what the US is doing when it breaches Syrian airspace, it requires Syrian government approval to do so."If the US can fly planes in Syrian airspace without Syrian approval, then this approval clearly isn't needed.By contrast, the Russians can't fly planes in Turkish airspace without the risk of those planes being blown into pieces by Turkish missiles. So the approval of the Turkish government seems to be quite important.

It is fortunate for these nations that Syria hasn't done so. And even more fortunate for Syria.

03 Jun 2016 4:34:24pmZing, if an aircraft is shot down while breaching a sovereign state's airspace it does not legally entitle the state to which that aircraft belonged to respond in kind.Given that the US thinks it is above international law I think it possible that the US would use one of its aircraft being shot down while in breach of international law as justification to respond in kind. Illegally.That Syria has so far not attempted to shoot down US aircraft breaching its sovereignty is possibly because they have their hands full dealing with US illegal covert action to overthrow its government and they would not want to give it an excuse to take illegal overt action.

I suspect some of us already belong in some kind of a camp. Really, what is this you're on about? Increased wealth will only flow to the usual suspects and our environment will be destroyed by their rapacious farming methods. Just look at what they're doing to their own country! I suppose for those who would like to live under their system that they should try living under it first before encouraging it here. Be mindful of what Stalin did to the eastern European communists who emigrated, comrade. They were under suspicion of being foreign spies and shot.

We fought wars and proxy wars with little effect- except to the dead and maimed.Now since most of the dreaded communists are gone we are fighting wars with dreaded Islamic peoples with similar fatal results.However the dreaded Communist Chinese are still there so government and the media want to keep that fear alive.But as I look around me most everything I now own is made in China. This computer, those speakers, the printer, my torches, etcI am still free here in Australia but my future wealth is based on trade with China - and no-one dies. They might be buying our assets and manipulating our press but they are not killing us to do it.I think we need to keep some perspective with China. We forgave the Germans for WW1 and 2, the Japanese for their part in WW2.So what have the Chinese done to us by comparison?

03 Jun 2016 9:49:36amMartinSo What have Chinese done to us by comparison?Capitalism (The type where we have a massive poor working class and an obscenely rich ruling class) is a terribly flawed system BUT the Red Peril is even worse (according to Hollywood, Murdoch, and co), just Maybe the Chinese could show us that our system is not perfect and if we were allowed to know this maybe we would want change? maybe the idea of High speed trains being built in 3 years rather than taking 40 years to "research" is the right way? maybe a system of national co-ordination rather than individuals Moguls deciding our fate is better?The "Western" world and it's capitalist system has been hijacked from it's people and the power rests with a few, it's not really a bad system but it could be a lot better (for us the people, not so much for the elites).The "Eastern" world and it's communist system has also been hijacked and it to is not really a bad system, but it to could be a lot better.But if we are put in fear of anything but the status Quo, if we dread uncertainty, if we are lambasted for thinking different, if we are bombarded with media propaganda we might settle for what we have.Maybe the sin of the Chinese is to hold a mirror up to ourselves.
Alert moderator
03 Jun 2016 10:18:42amHbtm,you raise an interesting point when you suggest that perhaps the Chinese system of "national co-ordination", aka. State Control is better.For example, the Chinse state owned steel mills have been intentionally producing vast quantities of steel in order to dump it below cost on international markets which has resulted in the complete destruction of the UK steel industry (as it can not compete) along with various other steel industries being destroyed or being put under such extraordinary economic / financial pressure from cheap / dumped Chinese steel exports that government have turned to old fashioned protectionist policies to protect their steel industries.We have seen USA tariffs on a number of Chinese steel products increase by 500%+ recently as they seek to protect their steel industry (which is of national security importance).The Chinese aim is one with a clearly defined long term objective of destroying the steel industries in other nations (predominately the west) in order to create market dominance and to have a degree of control over particular resources with a national security significance.Though... you don't need 'state control' to do the above.As seen by the actions of Tata Steel (India) which purchased the UK steel industry, then gave itself billions in free carbon credits (due to its 'negotiations' with UK/EU representative), it then sold the billions of dollars worth of (freely obtained) excess carbon credits, it used the money obtained from UK/EU taxpayers to fund the building of brand new steel industries in India and other low wage/cost nations in Asia, which enabled them to produce steel at a vastly lower price and flood the global steel market, which has enabled them (and the Chinese) to cause the collapse of the UK steel industry. Tata then sort to sell off the assets of the UK steel industry piece meal to prevent a 'management/worker buy out' that could potentially threaten Tata Steels market share in the future.The entire western leadership has been an absolute lame duck throughout these ongoing strategic moves to destroy western steel industrial infrastructure and the entire industry by being complicit in enabling and allowing foreign nations and companies to undertake their strategic plans unhindered (or worse by enabling them) while they pursue the mantra of 'globalised free markets' without regard to the activities and behaviours of other nation states and their leading companies.

03 Jun 2016 11:43:58amAmusing to read about TATA giving the Brits a haircut re steel. I am sure the Indians remember what Britain did to them industrially during their period of colonization..Britain during this period decimated or transferred local Indian industries and in the process left India, which had been one of the worlds richest nations, one of the poorest when they left.AS for China acting like Western Capitalists in gaining market share I thought that its a great example of " democracy " in action.

Obama went and followed his advice)?

Already they own farms here, the logistics to get their produce produced by their workers on our soil, and the lease of major ports. Chinese Australian business groups are attempting to exert political influence on our government. We're being subverted by the communist Chinese, and they're not wanting us to buy Coca-Cola, eat hamburgers, dress in Levi jeans and listen to rock and roll. They want us well behaved, orderly and manageable. Remember this evil regime executes political prisoners and trades in their organs. I have no problems with Chinese people  - I've lived with some of them - but we shoild always remember the Chinese communists are incredibly arrogant and racist.

It was part of the bargain for peace after their failed grab for world domination.As for China? They objected to UN presence in Korea, so they fought a United Nations peacekeeping force. When a nation is willing to declare war on all humanity for half a peninsula, it's a sign people should keep an eye on them.

03 Jun 2016 9:17:44amThe truth is that many Australians underestimate the importance of China in the world today and lack understanding of its history, culture and power. We are too focused on Washington and London and many still regard Asia as a strange place we fly over to get to somewhere we feel more comfortable.Of course China will seek to use soft power to spread its influence, but there's nothing unusual about that. After all, we are daily bombarded with propaganda, official and unofficial, from Western media including the BBC, CNN and Fox. That's why the modestly alternative approach of Al Jazerra has often been so interesting.Instead of fearing China, we should try harder to understand it. If we did, we would discover a culturally rich and very interesting environment with many opportunities for Australia to exploit.The Chinese obviously see us as worth courting. Could it be because Australia is the best-placed nation in the world to bring together the Asian and European traditions and societies into a forward-looking and dynamic approach to the world?Rather than hiding behind powerful Western friends, we should get out there and make our own way as a nation.

The CCP have put a lid on the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution, the 1989 TS massacre and the invasion of Tibet and are trying to use "soft power" to achieve their aims. China was humiliated by the colonial powers and the Japanese and they aim to redress that by economic supremacy over the USA and expansion of their homeland into the South China Sea and eventually the incorporation of Taiwan.Just like the far from perfect USA, they want to rule the world economically but unlike the USA they do not have freedom of the press, civil liberties, rule of law and the right to vote.

This isn't the 20th century where Westerners look down on the Chinese as a matter of course.And whilst many may appreciate their history, culture, and people, that doesn't mean we shouldn't be worried about the actions of an increasingly belligerent and influential government which doesn't have a good track record with respect to both its neighbours nor its own people.You seem to be suggesting that our national broadcaster should censor itself to appease the CCP as a recognition of China's importance.

03 Jun 2016 9:28:44amSo the fear seems to be the possible undesirable  influence Chinese media might have over the broader Australian population.    Its a fear I share every time I make a mistake and watch some of what the USA News machines pump out. Jingoistic rhetoric full of self righteousness, arrogance, elitism and in a lot of instances, blatant deceptions.   We allow or even invite people of other cultures to visit, work and in some cases, become permanent residents of this country.  Is it right that we should deny those people access to their homeland news?   Fine lets restrict the BBC, CNN, Fox and best of all Fairfax, from being allowed to publish articles or have majority ownership of Australian media.  Lets emasculate them. Bill O'Reilly would be a great start. Meanwhile we should stop acting as the USA's Asian "minder" by babbling on about undue influence on behalf of the party responsible for more undue influence than the rest of the world combined.

It would be easier if they just leaned over and spoke to each other considering they share adjoining desks (but that would defeat the purpose).They prefer not to get involved in debates as that keeps the 'debate' focused on an area they don't want to discuss. Instead they will try to steer the theme of the forum into a particular 'safe' theme by talking amongst themselves (ie. criticism of western policy keeps the 'debate' about west and not China or its policies).

03 Jun 2016 10:48:09amIt mightn't hurt us to reflect upon why Al Jazeera (AJ+) and Russia Today (RT) are becoming increasingly mainstream among cyber natives while the traditional MSM, like News Ltd in general, and FOX News in particular are somewhat locked into an older demographic.If we're going to argue, not without justification, that China's "media values [are] anathema Australian notions of free speech, then it would be remiss to omit that the independence of both our ABC and the BBC is a price in distorting market competition worth paying for upholding the best traditions of the fourth estate. Even while the fifth estate beckons.If knowledge is power (notwithstanding that not all information leads to knowledge), then clearly there are, and have always been, power struggles that exert pressure on the independence of media. It has become just as important to counter coercive commercial influence in Western media as it has always been to resist the imposition of government controlled news in China. To ignore one at the expense of the other will inevitably produce distortions, the hard part is always identifying them and therefore knowing what to believe.

You can see exactly this occurring to the entire UK steel industry.The only other way in which they will invest is to buy up the entire supply chain in order to ensure any profits realised by each component of the supply change become profits to the foreign nation (and not Australia) to reduce total cost, whilst at the same time realising complete monopolistic control over key infrastructure to prevent competition.And.... like you point out .... that has not only been allowed to occur.... but has been actively encouraged.While our politicians and only think (of themselves) from one election cycle to another the Chinese are playing the long game.

03 Jun 2016 10:53:52amDeutsche Welle (DW) is an arm of the German government using soft power. On the rare occasion that I caught it I found it does not represent German issues which I read on German websites. Call it promotion or propaganda, everyone wants only their positive stuff in the media.

03 Jun 2016 11:36:46amThere should be serious concerns about this kind of cooperation of Australian media with China.China is a totalitarian state where the media is an extension of government and no independent media exists. We don't want this culture having effect in Australia.

03 Jun 2016 12:10:23pmSimon Says, 'fear the competition'. lolOur home runs on German and China manufactured solar arrays plus American made wind generators. If not for the competition I'd not have excess current and not be helping to rebuild locally what the law creators have taken away over recent decades.The we I know are working toward converting our collective excess current into a local health system so the unwell can actually get back to work. To develop our own manufacturing base is next on the hit list. Who cares how many channels of propaganda the idiot box has to choose from? It's all just piss 'nd wind in any case.If you are so paralyzed with fear of competition like the do nothing useful idiots at canberra, at least get out of the way.

03 Jun 2016 12:30:17pmHow unusual it is for an indoctrinated western journalist claiming that the Chinese government is 'amateur' and lacking 'international experience'. Its got such a familiar, 70 year ring to it, being similar to the derogatory comments frequently stated about Putin/other communist governments. These are precisely the sort of propaganda that the Chinese government is objecting to and trying to counter.It is unlikely the government was interested in the author for little more than extracting information about the Australian Governments media organization having been 'an insider'. Yes, the proposition was 'unlikely', so obviously this wasn't the object of the meeting, and by the sounds of it, the journalist took the bait.Clearly, the Chinese Government is 'evil' and so don't believe a word they are saying/buyer beware.A bit of substance rather than the cold war/containment propaganda of the 'stupid, evil communist regime restricting freedoms' routine please.Is the Chinese governments restrictions on 'Free Speech' any different from the biased reporting of western 'Capitalist' governments/ commercial media/journalists? The results are the same. Facts are withheld and truth distorted.

03 Jun 2016 12:31:41pmSpot on!All cashed up and looking for overseas assets and power! Just like the smiling assassin, the Chinese are scooping up anything of value that they can get their sticky little fingers in to. We sit idly by letting it happen because we need the enormous cash injection to keep our economy afloat. The quiet infiltration of our media is a way of creating 'feel good' stories that mask their  intentions. One day we will wake up too late. They will own the place and Aussies will be nothing more than the playthings of a powerful foreign juggernaut.As they say: "Australia;  beautiful one day.....Chinese the next." Agree?

03 Jun 2016 12:32:28pmChina is vital to the Australian economy and the USA is embedded in our defence strategy.Some how we are currently left straddling the barbed wire fence.A very clever country would find advantage from this.What must be avoided is the danger of becoming collateral damage if/when the two elephants engage.

03 Jun 2016 3:00:57pmI just read in a very respected journal that Jacob Zuma from South Africa was bribed by the Chinese to close down SA's textile industry thereby putting 100,000 locals out of work, just so China could get its economic foot in the door.I think that fence has long ago had its wire removed.

03 Jun 2016 12:54:26pmIt is hardly surprising that China is trying to get its own messages across, judging by the kind of one-sided and often predictable news and non-news posted by Western journalists.When China built that railway into Tibet, Western media had a ball. It was suggested that China is taking another "Great leap forward" to further its strangulation of Tibet. As a consequence, the local cultures will suffer from the Hans Chinese's dominance. Well, I thought it is the role of a government to provide essential services to the outback. However, Western media found a way to twist the positives into negative, and almost spruiked that railway project into a "foreign invasion". I wonder if the remote communities in the far North will view a railway to service them as an invasion or a service that is long overdue?Then the recent Chinese involvement in the Pacific regions are viewed as a "intrusion" by media. The Chinese had been active in that region for a very long time. They were the traders mostly. They even intermarried with the locals. Remember Sir Julius Chan of the PNG?There is one big difference between the Chinese and the Western powers. The Western powers brought in money and expected immediate returns. Most of the money in the form of foreign aids ended up employing advisors from the donor nations anyway. The Chinese takes a long term view of their involvement. They are into "relationships". Sure, money, and a lot of it changed hands, but would you prefer money rather than guns? So which style or approach is preferable? It depends on whether you are the receivers of the aid, or a competitor. Regarding the Chinese wanting to have their own news spreads in a Western newspapers, one could hardly blame them when often negative news are the norms than the exception.By the way, the Chinese expansion in the South China Seas is not a very desirable event in terms of world stability. However, the West's meddling in the world, especially in the Middle East, has caused more instability than all the troubles the Chinese created, in multiples of 100 !

03 Jun 2016 3:38:52pmTibet isn't China province. Tibetans are different to all other ethnics who called themselve Chinese. Tibet was an independent country and was invaded by Mao's red China.China should return Inner Mongolia to Mongolia. Uyghur to its lawful owner too.Julius Chan was born in 1939 by a Chinese father who emigrated to Papua New Guinea. Don't make out that he is a descendent of Chinese traders of the 15th century.

03 Jun 2016 4:55:42pm"...Tibet was an independent country and was invaded by Mao's red China."How about we all turn history back by decades and even centuries? The troublesome religious nutters will bugger off back to Europe and leave American to the indigenous Indians to their own device? How about back home in Australia, the Aborigines ought to get their own land back after all the immigrants, and not just the white settlers, leave ? As I understand, Australia isn't part of England ?Perhaps your comprehension is not as good as you believe you are capable of. I didn't link Sir Julius Chan's ancestor to any Chinese trader in the 15th century, but mentioned the fact that his old man was a Chinese who migrated to PNG. I hope that clears up the confusion a bit for you ?

03 Jun 2016 2:35:07pmAustralian media is an obvious joke, but we're all still waiting for the punch line.Our national broadcaster has sunk so low it's even getting flamed by the denizens of -would you believe- Rendezview:"Spare us your faux outrage, why don't you take your insipid Political Correctness off to the ABC where the mindless drones of Group-Think might appreciate it."Awks.

03 Jun 2016 3:12:47pmHow come Western journalists are so afraid of the officials and leaderships of Communist China?I dare the ABC and other Australian journos to ask Chinese officials about their human rights violation in China, Tibet and Uyghur.Ask China if India should claim the whole Indian Ocean too as that vast ocean also bears the name of India.

03 Jun 2016 4:17:01pm Good Point PN, I suggest that we change the name of Australia to "Southern Pacific" Imagine how many man made Islands just off the beaches of other countries we could build!

03 Jun 2016 4:49:17pmPN;How come? Is it because Australia should beef up it's scrutiny of what could be seen as propaganda and the corporate world doesn't like the sound of that. Corruption doesn't care what political party or business you are in.
