The Federal Government will release its long-overdue white paper setting out its Defence Force strategic priorities and reform agenda for the next 20 years tomorrow (Saturday).Defence Minister Joel Fitzgibbon, who is keen to make savings through efficiency improvements, commissioned the white paper in February last year.There has been speculation the paper will outline a naval and air force build up in response to the growing power of China in the region.The white paper's formulation has been led by Deputy Secretary of Strategy, Coordination and Governance Michael Pezzullo who has travelled to China to discuss the paper with authorities ahead of its release.It has also been reported that the Navy's submarine fleet will be doubled to 12 and up to 100 Joint Strike Fighters will be ordered.It is also expected that the Government will continue a 3 per cent real increase each year in Defence spending, despite the tight economic conditions.It was originally set for release by the end of last year.Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has defended the Government's focus on China."It follows very plainly that here in the Asia Pacific region there are uncertain parts of the region," he told Melbourne ABC Local Radio."We simply need to take a calm, measured, responsible approach for the future to make sure that our Army, Navy and Air Force have the resources they need for the future.""We've got to make sure we're taking decisions now which means that those who come after us can look to the men and women of the Australian Defence Force."Tensions between the minister and the department have been frought during the final months of the paper's completion in the wake of the SAS pay bungle and revelations that the department spied on Mr Fitzgibbon over his relationship with a Chinese-Australian businesswoman.But Mr Fitzgibbon has been determined to implement his reforms to the forces, hinting when the spying claims were revealed that the incident may have been motivated by those disgruntled by his agenda.
