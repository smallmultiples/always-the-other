The Prime Minister's comments in praise of Japanese soldiers during World War II have angered China. This isn't just shaky diplomacy - it's also poor history, writes Kerry Brown.While the one golden rule of diplomacy is that there are no golden rules, a pretty good rule of thumb is that when engaging with other countries, you become involved in their internal affairs at your peril, and only when you have to.War, internal instability with international ramifications, flagrant government abuses - all these, when the evidence is there, are valid things to express a view on. But when two countries like Japan and China are having a long-term, highly acrimonious spat that partly involves the present (disputed maritime borders) and partly involves the past (World War II), it best for countries like Australia to steer as far clear as possible of the latter. Being dragged in on one side or another, particularly on historic issues, is usually a losing wicket.Tony Abbott may learn this the hard way after he made comments during prime minister Shinzo Abe's visit to Australia which seemed to praise Japan's World War II soldiers.Abe's visit has seen the signing of a significant free trade deal, and the cementing of a stronger bilateral relationship with a country which is, after all, Australia's second largest economic partner, and one which is emerging into healthier growth and offering stronger potential for co-operation. This should have been more than enough to celebrate during the visit, particularly in view of Abbott's chagrin late last year when his comment about Japan being Australia's biggest friend in Asia went down so badly in Beijing.The relationship with China is a tricky one. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop spoke this week about the need to assert our values and not just focus on the money when we deal with Beijing. At the same time former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton seemed to criticise what she saw as Australia's slavish attitude to China in an interview promoting her recent book.The current strategy in Canberra however seems sensible enough: diversify, seek friends wherever you can, build the core economic links, and have these as the main thrust of what you are doing. But as Abbott's remarks to Abe make clear, underlying all of this is a very emotional commitment by current Australian leaders to being as visibly faithful and strongly connected to the US, and older allies like Japan, as possible. This urge seems to be pushing Abbott into making unnecessarily forceful remarks about issues that he need not express any opinion on.The residue of ill-feeling about World War II stains Japan's relations across the region. It is not just China that has an issue with some of Abe's statements, and his moves to review judgements made in the past about the issue of comfort women. However well this might play domestically (and many in Japan don't agree with his more assertive stance on these issues), it is not just China that has responded angrily. South Korea in particular has issued statements expressing worry and dissent.Japanese inability to deal with the past is an ongoing issue. And expressing any opinion on something so raw and alive today is hazardous.The point is that it is not just shaky diplomacy that Abbott is practicing when he opines on these things - it is also poor history.Oxford Professor Rana Mitter's superb study China's War with Japan, issued last year, sets out eloquently and authoritatively just why many in China now might still have strong feelings about this history. Twenty million of their compatriots died in this struggle, and large parts of the country were decimated. Fifty million were made homeless. Cities like Shanghai became bloody war fronts, with terrible human suffering. The pitting of a modernised, industrial nation against one still largely rural and undeveloped was, Mitter argues, something that almost fundamentally destroyed China. It only just survived as a country.Mitter's book makes one more salient point that Mr Abbott might pay attention to before he speaks up about this matter in the future. China was our ally in that conflict, and its battle fronts were ones that were crucially important for the global struggle against fascism. Australians fought in those battles and made heroic sacrifices.This is too often forgotten. At that time, it was Japan that posed the threat, managing to attack as far south as Darwin. Praising the Japanese war effort therefore doesn't just cause offence in China - it denigrates Australia's own history.It is great that Japan is now a strong ally - as a democracy, a liberal trading partner, and a supporter of the international systems of norms and regulations. Building a good relationship between Australia and Japan is logical, and utterly defensible.These are the things that will matter most, rather than ad hominem views on arguments between two important countries that Australia has no reason to get involved in. That is the reason why it is unlikely we will hear current US secretary of state John Kerry make comments like these in his tour through the region this week. It is not necessary and it does not help.Professor Kerry Brown is executive director of the China Studies Centre and Professor of Chinese Politics at the University of Sydney.

Comments for this story are closed.10 Jul 2014 3:47:55pmThe Prime Minister's comments in praise of Japanese soldiers during World War II  has to be the most offensive thing he has done in a long time.Is he totally unaware of the utter brutality of the Japanese? If any of you out there know an Australian soldier that fought in WWII against the Japanese ask them. I've heard some horrific stories about the Japanese. And the Chinese and Koreans have even worse stories to tell. There is a very good reason why those two counties hate Japan and for our PM to praise their soldiers is a total insult. He should hide his head in shame.

10 Jul 2014 7:43:45pmTA commented on the bravery of those who (possibly) wanted to and tried to invade us. I don't try to defend much cruelty that happened, though I understand it's historical roots. I do however disagree that those who were prepared for the ultimate sacrifice and, in many cases, saw honourable death preferable to surrender, were not courageous. If you can explain how his comments had anything to do with treatment in concentration camps (which was wrong) then please post it articulately and in detail. If you have any other basis, for the individual soldier, for why they lacked courage, then please post it.

11 Jul 2014 9:33:05amAt the start of the war the Japanese opened hostilities with a cowardly surprise attack.During the war the Japanese soldiers cowardly murdered civilians and prisoners with great gusto.In the closing stages of the war the Japanese leadership cowardly refused to lose face and surrender when it was clear that they had lost the war thus lengthening the horrific conflict.Overall, I would say that cowardice and not bravery characterized the activities of the Japanese military during WWII irrespective of the deeds of individual soldiers.It looks like Tony Abbott has been caught out, once again, speaking conveniently rather than truthfully.

11 Jul 2014 11:30:39amDo we also say that suicide bombers now and before in WW2 are brave people?Japanese Unit 731 was set up to wage biological warfare and it did. It cut many Chinese, Russians and Pacific Islanders WITHOUT Anesthetic as the evil scientists were worried that anesthetic could mask the effectiveness of their biological agents. Towards the end of the WW2 there were plans to send suicide bombers to US with biological agents.

11 Jul 2014 2:36:01pmJapan attacked Pearl Harbour Hawaii without declaration of war and thus cheated. Japan bombed its own railway in NE  China in 1937 and used it as a pretext to wage war in China. On11 Sept 2012 Abe made a phony purchase of the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands and claimed them for Japan. Oboma in Tokyo recently said he had no comments on the sovereignty of these Islands disputed between China and Japan.

11 Jul 2014 1:11:25amHarvey,It's worth noting that Abbott seems to relish in 'stirring the ants up' and doesn't seem to care also about our relationship with Indonesia, any other nation in the Pacific or South-East asia, using war rhetoric with ease and when it suits him without a care in the world.The horrors you speak of defy comprehension, but unfortunately they would be almost nothing compared to the horrors that we could inflict on people in today's world. All it takes is a slide into xenophobia and protectionism and Abbott is all happy to push us in this direction, into the abyss.

Chances are that contemporary Japanese people are very sorry about what happened in WW2.  So, by all means, let's trade with them, talk with them,now that so much time has passed but, lest we forget, praising the Japanese army is something else. It is as brutal as the Japanese soldiers were in WW2. Before calling people a Hypocrite, think things out a bit, 'Damage.'Apt name you've chosen for yourself there.

11 Jul 2014 9:49:36amActually contemporary Japanese people know almost nothing about WW2. It isn't a topic most tourists bring up but in my time there I was fortunate to meet three elderly veterans who were well aware of what Imperial Japan did. They were not proud of their part in it but we were able to tell me of their experiences. Young Japanese have no idea.

11 Jul 2014 1:57:19pmActually, with respect, you are wrong on that score.  Many of the current generation are perfectly well aware of their country's history.  It is the previous generation who are reluctant to discuss this history, but it is not actively suppressed anymore. Abe is motivated to suppress debate/information about WW2 simply because his own father was in the Wartime government.  In my view, this should disqualify him to be their PM, but this is only MY view.  People of his country are grown up enough to make their own decisions.

The war is long over, and most people have gotten on with their lives.It simply was not necessary for Abbott to make any comment whatsoever to appease Japanese feelings. It was virtually grovelling, and inappropriate.  The fact that we buy Japanese cars should be enough to convince their makers that Australians are willing to live and let live.It was certainly an affront to the RSL, and if you have read the very telling account of our war in the pacific in books like "Coastwatchers" you could easily understand why.Gratuitous comment in diplomatic circles surely is not a must. It is unlikely that will cement friendships, but has the possibility of offending others.And " The adults are in charge"!!!

10 Jul 2014 9:32:07pmAs a young child, riding on my bike past a concentration camp in Bandung, I saw three Dutch prisoners of war who had been bayoneted in the stomach, with the bayonets left in their stomachs, leaning against a barbed wire fence and left to die slowly. I can still hear their screams. My father, another POW, drowned while a captive on a troop transport ship heading for the mines in Japan The Japanese did not let anyone know that there were POWs aboard, so the boat was torpedoed by an ally of the Dutch. Was my fathereaten by a shark, did he drift in the water for long?How uninformed and unthinking our PM is. To praise Japanesesoldiers is not only a disgrace it is an outrage.
Alert moderator
11 Jul 2014 7:51:52amThe PM was talking about the submariners who attacked Sydney Harbour. They were given a burial with full military honours at the time. The "praise" you are attacking was a direct quote from the words spoken by Admiral Muirhead at that ceremony. So now, apparently our top ranking WW2 admiral is a disgrace.

11 Jul 2014 9:30:27amHarry and others the article was about the wisdom (or lack thereof) of being seen to praise a bitter WW2 enemy in a diplomatic setting...Abbott did not have to say anything.

It goes to his judgement as our "leader"...Also there seems to be just a little revisionist history creeping in around the world at the moment...Nationalist sentiment rising does not lead to good places.
Alert moderator
11 Jul 2014 10:10:53amIn case you hadn't noticed, WW2 represented the most significant prior interaction between Australia and Japan. Ignoring it would like have provoked a different faux outrage from the cretinous left.Addressing it, and pointing out that from a bitter conflict we can emerge as partners isn't exactly a bad plan.A writer deliberately concealing the words said, and verballing the PM is absolutely reprehensible. The number of commenters here who have expressed extreme outrage and haven't even bothered to find out what was said shows just how bereft of any moral basis the loony left is.
Alert moderator
11 Jul 2014 10:48:46amXinhua wasn't thrilled either. Maybe they can't be bothered to dissect whatever it is that Abbott actually meant. He's the one communicating - if it's so open to misinterpretation, better he just shut his mouth. As the author suggests.What good could have possibly come from such comments?Of course there were acts of both bravery and bastardry committed by the IJA. Those submariners were indeed brave men. And yes, we shouldn't hold to historical grievances. But some of the outrage from Australians posting here is not "faux" - show some respect.And the Chinese copped it far worse than us.
Alert moderator
11 Jul 2014 12:40:46pmIndeed - even if we did not harbour any ill will against the Japanese for things they did to us, China and Korea both hate Japan still.Giving Japan a friendly handshake on the issue of their war soldiers is a slap in the face to China.

11 Jul 2014 10:28:04amThe Japanese in WWII were truly effective soldiers. Arguably they were more effective than the invading Australian troops at Gallipoli in WWI. No one seems offended when the Turks are generous enough to praise the Australian forces. Abbot's comments are not a matter of faulty history or the expression of offensive views. Their acceptability is a matter of personal opinion and preference.
Alert moderator
11 Jul 2014 11:28:21amWhile i'm not a huge fan of all the adoration heaped on the Australian troops at Gallipoli, to suggest that they were guilty of anything even close to the barbarism of the Japanese troops of WW2 is pretty galling. I'd suggest you might want to do a bit of research into what the Japanese did and then you might understand why the parallels you've drawn aren't really relevant

10 Jul 2014 4:42:19pmI suppose that dropping atomic bombs on Japan was the most brutal and horrific action in the history of warfare. Nothing else comes close.
Alert moderator
10 Jul 2014 5:00:35pmThey were asked twice to surrender unconditionally, or face annihilation. These people were so arrogant it took two bombs to convince them.
Alert moderator
10 Jul 2014 5:51:27pmMy understanding of the situation was that in Japan there existed a face-preserving cultural requirement to deliberate over their surrender. This final formality in the teeth of unprecedented weaponry took long enough even though it was the inevitable outcome, for the Americans to drop a second bomb. Lost tragically in translation, the unfolding of these events is still horrible to recall, even more than a half century later.
Alert moderator
10 Jul 2014 6:34:54pmYour understanding is wrong, Bahbet. The Japanese refused to accept an unconditional surrender and resolved to treat it with a cultural approach we would refer to as "silent contempt".When the first bomb fell, the Japanese war cabinet got worried and met to discuss surrender. When the second bomb fell, the cabinet ended the meeting and moved to an immediate vote. Even after two bombs, cabinet was tied and the Emperor had to make a deciding vote to opt for surrender. The pro-war ministers argued that they could wait America out. After all, they argued, how many nuclear bombs could America possibly make?
Alert moderator
10 Jul 2014 7:29:27pmThe Japanese cabinet did not consider the atomic bombs to be sufficiently threatening while they maintained a standing army on mainland Asia (China) and were able to secure resources through that continent. The routing of the much-vaunted Kwantung Army by the Russians in August 1945 was the trigger for the surrender.
Alert moderator
10 Jul 2014 11:33:58pmTo put it further into context, the emperor's nephew needed to intervene on the day of the signing of the surrender to stop a renegade bunch of soldiers from attacking the allied fleet that had gathered in Tokyo bay.
Alert moderator
11 Jul 2014 9:20:49amZing,Quite right, some members of the Japanese military even attempted a coup over the Emperor and attempted to capture him. He however managed to hide until the coup failed, and then announced the surrender of Japan.
Alert moderator
11 Jul 2014 1:09:02pmYou just need to look at the dates of the second bomb Aug 9 and the date of the actual surrender Aug 15.  The Japanese did not surrender the next day after Nagasaki.  There was even a failed coup.  They had to be dragged kicking and screaming.It is also my understanding that as the war drew to an end the Emperor's mother was also a major influence in not wanting to surrender due to the loss of face that would result.  I guess it is easy if you are not the one at risk or do not have any skin in the game.  Is she a feminist icon?
Alert moderator
10 Jul 2014 9:14:26pmActually most historians tend to agree that it was the invasion of Manchuria by Russia and it's annihilation of the Japanese armies there that forced the Japanese into surrender. However, I think your comment rather misses the pony of the article: It's not a debate about who was the "nastiest" in WW2, it's commenting on the necessity and usefulness of our PM referring to the war at all.

11 Jul 2014 8:58:47amHe definitely needs to shut his mouth, the trouble with this mob and I call them a mob as they flap away with nothing coming out that makes sense, to praise the japs for there war is disgraceful, they didn't fight with honour, and for all the imports out there, I would rather have my family alive and with me then lying dead somewhere we don't know about, Abbott is a disgrace to the Australians who fought and died for this island.

10 Jul 2014 5:22:41pmBurke, the use of atomic weapons by the US to end the Pacific war was small potatoes compare with some of the atrocities committed by the Japanese, suggested reading for you would be the Rape of Nanking for starters. As to whether or not the average Japanese soldier was "brave", this is quite true, he was a superb light infantryman, well equipped and well trained and motivated for the time, he was more than a match for the average Chinese soldier and in the earlier parts of the Pacific conflict was more than a match for the average Australian/British/American soldier, it was only after the allies developed overwhelming firepower did his individual qualities become obsolete., I once read somewhere that someone who does such things worked out that it took 7,000 tons of explosive to kill each Japanese soldier.   The fact that he used brutal methods which were alien to western thinking actually increased his effectiveness as a soldier as it spread terror and sapped his opponents will to fight which was exactly what it was intended to do.
Alert moderator
10 Jul 2014 6:36:19pm150-170,000 casualties in the atomic bomb explosions - Japan surrendered 2 days after the Nagasaki bomb. Estimates of casualties for a conventional invasion of Japan based on figures from previous island invasions - 1,000,000 Allied soldiers, 2,000,000 Japanese soldiers and up to 5-10,000,000 Japanese civilians. The bombs were terrible but far less than the potential death toll. Japan in a soldier to soldier fight would have fought to the last corpse - being obliterated by bombs with no chance of the 'honorable' death finally convinced them to stop - millions of lives saved.

10 Jul 2014 7:14:06pmDresden firebombing killed 200,000 in one night. War is hell for all and the first casualty, as we know, is the truth.Another damn fine reason for TA not to mention it.

10 Jul 2014 8:55:57pmCasualties in Dresden in 1945 were nowhere near 200,000. That claim is from Holocaust denier David Irving in the early 1960s, based on Goebel's statements immediately after the attacks. Current estimates are, at most, 25,000 dead. It was also two days of raids, RAF and USAAF, on a city where the Nazi administrator had built himself a wonderful bomb shelter but done incredibly little for the populace.

11 Jul 2014 9:24:24amBrett,The figures for casualties in the Dresden bombing / firestorm remain contentious with David Irvings figure being the utter maximum and the current estimates of 25,000 being currently politically acceptable to the EU member nations.The problem is that vast numbers of refugees had fled to Dresden whom had not been counted and as such no one will ever really know the full toll.Such is the price of Total War, ....lest we forget.

10 Jul 2014 9:11:07pmAs did firebombing in most other cities in Japan. Killed more people in a slighlty slower rate than the atomic weapons but still of the order of 100000 a night. What did Abbot say about the japanese anyway? The article didn't mention a quote and a blanket all jap soldiers are bad is a little backward. There are many praiseworthy things to say about the japanese soldier.  Courage, Discipline to name a few.
Alert moderator
11 Jul 2014 8:16:14amThe reason the article didn't mention the quote was because it is just another ABC beatup. The "quote" was in fact Abbott quoting the words of Admiral Muirhead during the burial of Japanese submariners who attacked Sydney Harbour. They were buried with full military honours and Abbott's statements were directed at the courage of those submariners.

11 Jul 2014 9:58:19amAh, that makes more sense. I though I had missed something entirely as I had not heard about this alleged faux pas anywhere else.

11 Jul 2014 12:46:52pmNo, Dad, it is not appropriate to talk about that in a meeting with the Japanese PM, because China is going to take any sentence that includes "Japan" and "WWII" in it the wrong way if they possibly can.Do you realise they are currently both posturing at each other in acts of passive aggression?

11 Jul 2014 1:11:13amHi SPM, Zing and chriss,Debate about the decision to drop the A-bombs in August, 1945 has been heated, and likely to continue as long as US Defense Dept records remain secret. However, we are now well aware that, before the US choice to drop the bombs was made, Japan had been in serious negotiations with Soviet Russia to seek peace. The ante was suddenly 'upped' when the USSR, quite expediently desiring to extend hegemony over Japan and its territories, declared war on her. Now the US would need a rapid means to counter this .  The bombs, totally unknown to most of the world, were ready.  Russia had to be shown what the US possessed, and was prepared to do.... Despite eloquent pleas from Manhattan Project scientists like Einstein and our own Sir Mark Oliphant, Truman gave the go-ahead.As for 'unconditional  surrender' - well, no, it wasn't. Japan extracted several concessions from the US, not least being allowed to retain the Emperor. All this said, it is sad that Japanese schoolchildren are taught little about Nanking, the Tol Plantation massacre, Comfort Women, etc. The 'party line' is held rigorously by the government, and PM Abe still visits the Yasukini  Shrine. As for Mr Abbott's latest ' effluxion'..... There is nothing one can add, except to reflect that (fortunately!) the man is unique....!Cass

10 Jul 2014 6:31:56pmPlenty does unfortunately. The fire bombing of Dresden,a civilian city with no war industry, killed more than either nuclear bombs in Japan. Burning phosphorus is a devastating weapon and, like the nuclear bombs, was aimed at destroying the will of the people rather than the war effort.

10 Jul 2014 6:43:38pmNo it wasn't.....letting thousands of Japanese war criminals escape punishment was... all thanks to General Douglas MacArthur and the USA that saw profit before justice.
Alert moderator
10 Jul 2014 10:27:28pmI don't think it was that simple, Ross. I think MacArthur and others genuinely respected Japanese culture and did not want the society to fall apart. Certainly the older Japanese I have discussed this with had that opinion.
Alert moderator
10 Jul 2014 11:44:17pmI think Ross, that what McArthur and the Americans saw was not so much profit as a rampant Russia, and a great need to establish a bulwark against communism in the Asian region. Many of Japan's early political leaders were "forgiven" war criminals, and the "spiritual ancestors" of Abe and his current warmongering government. Abe's mother was the daughter of Nobusuke Kishi, a minister in General Tojo's wartime cabinet, and convicted war criminal. He was released in the name of potential anti-communism and became part of the foundations of the current LDP.  Abbott is obviously entirely ignorant of a very significant period of troubled Japan/Asian history and would have been far better off keeping his stupid mouth shut.
Alert moderator
11 Jul 2014 7:19:59amGreg, you should read Antony Beevor's Second World War. He suggests in fact that the atrocities on soldiers went unpunished because the US government had no taste for telling its citizens what had happened ie the horror was too great. The Japanese certainly were treated very lightly compared to Germany in war crimes and consequently the nation is utterly unware of them at grass roots. Abe prays at a shrine to them.
Alert moderator
11 Jul 2014 2:22:33pmSchmoozing with Japan has more to do with sending a message to China.   As of 2013, Japan currently has the fifth largest defence budget in the world.  That is a nice buffer between us and China.
Alert moderator
11 Jul 2014 2:29:16pmYes, and he could also read William Manchester's wonderful biography of MacArthur, "American Caesar": it goes into all aspects of the pre history of the war in the Pacific, the war itself and it's aftermath. A long read but totally worth it.

10 Jul 2014 4:44:15pmAgreed.Praising the Japanese mini sub attack that sank HMAS Kuttabul, killing 21 sailors in Sydney harbour as "skillful & honourable" is disgraceful, so utterly contemptuous and so self serving that it shows there is nothing that Tony Abbott will not say or do to curry favour with who he chooses. I wonder if he will say that the Japanese soldiers who murdered civilian nurses were skillful, brave and heroic? Or the ones who committed the war crimes on the tens of thousands of allied prisoners from 1942-45, were they noble, upstanding human beings just doing their duty?Tony Abbott has pissed on the memory of the men who lost their lives in that attack and as such should be banned from any ANZAC commemorations in the future .

10 Jul 2014 5:34:05pmAG, actually to enter a hostile enemy harbour in a midget submarine and sink an enemy vessel is both a very courageous and skilful thing to do and considering that the crews of those submarines paid with their lives they are worthy of some respect, they were given proper military funerals by the Australian authorities at the time and great respect was shown. Later in the war the British did much the same thing when they attempted to sink the German battleship Tirpitz which was anchored in a Norwegian fiord , they were partially successful and the Tirpitz sustained heavy damage but did not sink. The brave men who carried out that raid are rightfully looked upon as heroes.

10 Jul 2014 6:09:03pmtraveller,But do the Germans now congratulate the British for their attack on the Tirpitz  that killed German sailors? BTW the Japanese attack in Sydney Harbor also killed many civilians.Abbott is indeed a fool on this matter. All he had to say was - NOTHING.

10 Jul 2014 7:05:44pmActually Rusty they held the British Royal Marine Commandoes and Naval personnel who participated in the Tirpitz raid in high regard just as allied servicemen had a lot of respect for some of the elite units of the  German army.  A bit of research would have revealed to you that the 21 people killed in the Sydney Harbour raid were members of the Australian Navy and as such were legitimate war targets, there weren't many civilian casualties as the Japanese were after military targets in particular a USN Heavy Cruiser which was anchored in Sydney Harbour at the time.

10 Jul 2014 7:49:33pmFor a much vaunted Rhodes Scholar Prime Minister Abbott is an embarrassment to Australia every time he opens his mouth and puts his foot squarely in it.  His praise of Japans expertise in military matters was better left unsaid and every returned man or woman who served in the Pacific region during the second world war should let him know how wrong it was to express such views.  Mr. Abe must be laughing up his kimono sleeve today.

10 Jul 2014 11:50:36pmThe Prime Minister appears either uninformed or still a Britisher, since most of Australia's forces were busy in Europe serving Britain, plus some sent to save Ceylon, when the Japanese subs got inside Sydney Harbour. It's not like there was a lot of defence against the Japanese at the time.

11 Jul 2014 8:16:37amDt3, Please read some history before posting, at the start of the Pacific war the bulk of the Australian Army was in the Middle East not Europe, there was however about 300,000 partially trained militia in Australia available for it's defence.  It is true that some RAAF units were in Britain so I'll grant you that but at no time were Australian ground forces employed in Europe nor were any sent to Ceylon as you state.  Actually at the time of the submarine attack on Sydney Harbour it was very well defended but due to a series of unfortunate events and a certain degree of laxity on the part of those tasked with manning those defences they were caught napping.

11 Jul 2014 9:48:36amPerhaps you are very well read on all the battles Australian forces were involved in, and why Ceylon isn't mentioned. but Curtin was very frustrated that troops were sent there, by British command, fearing an invasion which never eventuated.Meanwhile, a poorly defended Australia was easy prey but not something to be widely advertised.They even praised the subs who entered a poorly protected Harbour, for fear of giving the game away.

I know a Kokoda veteran: it took sixty years for his nightmares to stop. The Japanese were also pursued for 50 years for compensation for POW's, before they begrudgingly paid up.If you want to learn more about the "War Skills" of the WW2 Japanese soldier that Abbott so admires, Google "Bangka Island Massacre".  You may also read about the Sandakan Death March. There are plenty more.If Abbott sees the Japanese submariners as skilled, what does he think about the Special Forces Z Force guys who sailed an old fishing vessel through enemy waters then paddled kayaks into Singapore Harbour sinking about 50000 tons of shipping. And the Japanese response was to slaughter thousands of innocent civilians.Read about the Rape of Nanking to see how the Chinese fared under Japanese occupation.Abbott is a complete and utter disgrace to this country. And I have advised my local member (Lib) of that in no uncertain terms.

10 Jul 2014 5:09:23pmClearly another ill-considered rant. Not by the PM, but by the yank. For many years, historians and military experts have praised the bravery and skill of, for example, the Japanese sailors who manned the midget submarines that attacked Sydney. The bodies of the four Japanese crewmen were cremated with full military honours at Sydney's Eastern Suburbs Crematorium on 9 June 1942 (the day after the shelling of Sydney and Newcastle by two of the mother submarines). Their ashes were returned to Japan during the war. You clearly have no understanding of how these things work.For once we have a PM prepared to acknowledge history and not run form it, and tell the truth, rather than trying to hide from it. Nothing in his comments detract from the horrors of the war at all, just as Mr Abe openly acknowledged Japan's guilt. So much for the left being 'progressive'. Just stick your head back in the sand for a few more decades mate.

10 Jul 2014 5:16:06pmAbbott didn't praise the deeds or crimes that Japanese soldiers committed.

I suspect that you problem is not what Abbott said, but with Abbott himself.Furthermore, Japan's actions might have been monstrous. But they didn't do anything to China that China hasn't done themselves (in some cases, to their own citizens). I'm not going to lose any sleep over China's sense of outrage. Being the world's largest dictatorship, they've earned every outrage they're given.

10 Jul 2014 7:57:36pmI don't believe China deserved the atrocities which occurred to it during WW2. But until they become a democracy, I don't care whether their government is offended or why it might choose to take offence.If China's government doesn't care about whether it's actions offend the Chinese people, why should we care whether our actions offend the Chinese government? Besides, what is an offended Chinese government going to do? Produce obscenely cheap goods? Unfairly modify it's currency values? Start drilling in the East China sea? Veto the west's proposals in the security council? Cancel business deals which are "no longer in the national interest"?They already do these things even when we don't offend them. So if they are offended, they'll have to wrack their brains to figure out a way to become more obstructive than they already are.

10 Jul 2014 11:33:41pmA key point is that Japan has never shown any real contrition for their wartime behaviour, or adequately apologised to the Asian neighbours they brutalised. Their education system has expunged all details from text books, and young Japanese are largely unaware of the history of China, Manchuria and WW2. A couple of generations of very good liberal scholars has fought to change this, but the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, led by people like the warmongering Abe (and his smug, leering sidekick Aso, whose family profited during WW2 through the brutal exploitation of POW slave labourers - including many Australians) have always blocked their efforts. Abbott's totally insensitive comments (obviously not drafted within DFAT) show total ignorance of regional sensitivities, and can only serve to drive a wedge between Australia and its other Asian neighbours, and put a stake through years of efforts to maintain a balanced and respected position in our region.

Yasukuni is a shrine and war memorial to all those who fought and died in wars, just as war memorials in Australia are. Australian soldiers also commtited atrocities in wartime, but being victors, they get to write the history. Shooting of Japanese soldiers who had surrendered or been captured was well hidden for decades, but it happened anyway.Many Australians do not see Ned Kelly in the same way as you might.

Japan & Germany were righting found guilty for the past, but here is a fact for the 2 countries that history only looks upon for evil, since 1945 both the counties have not used their military to accidently of deliberately kill civilians, they have not engaged in aggressive wars, and here is the thing, Australia, American, and England can not make this claim.As this situation will continue, it is getting hard to continually look into that window of 1935-45 as the only bad things done when it comes to wars and deaths of civilians. But keeping this focus is the equivalent of turning a blind eye to the past and present.Abbott himself, what can you say, simply this, there are some things best left unsaid for the purpose of not offending so called good friends, and more than that, important friends, and this clown said them.  I think it is a case of when he goes off his leash he becomes dangerous with what emanates from his mouth. Just a very very stupid thing to say when you know what China feels.

Asia.I later saw a French documentary which explained how Japan was forced into the war through embargoes, it had to fight or slowly starve.

11 Jul 2014 1:13:10pmPedro this isn't about Japan's continuing culpability to Australians.It is solely about the political foolishness of praising Japan's WWII soldiers in any capacity, when that is an issue that is guaranteed to raise China's ire.
Alert moderator
11 Jul 2014 3:02:43pmOr the ire of diggers at the local RSL. Very poor political judgement if you ask me. Abbott's comments have gone down very badly with both domestic and foreign audiences. Even ordinary Japanese are wary of any attempt to glorify their own military before 1945.
Alert moderator
11 Jul 2014 12:25:45pmBut what did he say which is contentious? The article doesn't say and neither does your post. A latter post mentions something about Japanese soldiers being brave. If that is all then the comment is going to be correct - at least to an extent. After all bravery isn't the sole domain of those who fight on the side of right. And the side of right isn't always clear either (although in this case I would argue it is).

11 Jul 2014 2:04:50pmWhy mention the war?Why because I suspect that was part of the deal with Japan's trade agreement.Abe is trying to get his country to be more aggressive in building up its war machine to do battle against China. He can now point to comments like Abbott's for international support for that build up.We get cheaper cars, no car industry and Japan gets pats on the back for their WWII bravery. Is that really smart?

10 Jul 2014 4:25:45pm'Tony Abbott may learn this the hard way after he made comments during prime minister Shinzo Abe's visit to Australia which seemed to praise Japan's World War II soldiers.'Abe's moral position on the inhuman treatment of opposing forces in the Second World War is clear. He visited the Yasukuni Shrine to honour around 1000 war criminals, including 14 of the worst offenders in history.Abe is fiercely nationalistic, and is working on changing the Japanese constitution by stealth, to allow Japan to engage in foreign war.It is unsurprising that Abbott knows nothing about Australian history, and his diplomatic efforts to date have been ham-fisted to say the least.However, even Abbott ought to understand the implications of Abe's actions, and want to stop them. As usual though, his own self-interest, his lack of morals, his obsession with neoliberalism, and his short-term thinking override Australia's national interest.

10 Jul 2014 5:18:10pmOf course, it is equally possible that the Japanese will be more inclined to listen to someone in relation to the Yasukuni Shrine issue who is not always just screaming at them or is megaphone diplomacy the only thing you understand? Your comment on changes to the Japanese constitution is also wrong. The amendments are designed to only Japan to support allies and/or the UN on operations. Is this a bad thing?

10 Jul 2014 5:54:16pmAMF,Perhaps you should read my post, especially the bit that says 'to allow Japan to engage in foreign war'. How does that conflict with the notion of supporting allies or the UN?Incidentally, opponents of the change point out that Abe is saying 'We won't abuse this change even though it's open to interpretation - just trust us.' In case you're an Abbott supporter, let's clarify that this is a politician saying 'trust us - we won't change our minds.'Where is there 'screaming' or 'megaphone diplomacy'?

10 Jul 2014 8:12:59pmSo, Alpha, would the train engine from the Burma railway that they brought back from Thailand to celebrate the accomplishment of the building of the Burma Railway during the Great East Asian War, and which is now in the museum at the Yasukuni Shrine not indicate that some, I repeat, some Japanese are not interested in listening.  And I did not hear any screaming diplomacy.  You clearly do not understand the deep significance of the Yasukuni Shrine, nor the history of WWII, and the aftermath that Japan has refused to ever really face as the Germans have done.  Macarthur was a disaster for the post war reconciliation and facing the truth that Japan needed.Abe's attitudes show that this is still a living issue, and Abbott's lack of recognition of that fact and his cringe-worthy speeches while Abe was here were a disgrace and will do us no favours in Asia and China.  Talk about megaphone diplomacy.  We can be friends with Japan without buying into their re-writing history, and poking China in the eye.  But this crowd has no concept of nuance.

He continues to travel round the globe, cowtowing to all and sundry.  How many nations have now been called "Australia's best friend".  Does he think they are stupid?  The lies and deceit that worked on the Australian public won't work on the international front. It is one thing to encourage trade, but another to praise their war effort.

10 Jul 2014 4:29:36pmThe PM's comments, taken in the context of the Japanese PM's visit, were not that outrageous. I think they were ill-informed; but before the usual suspects vent mock outrage, they should remember that Robert McNamara also said that the US were war criminals in that conflict, too. It's just that winners don't get tried.China has to scream from the rooftops any chance they can get; and who can blame them? They are being encircled by those who would like to stymie their growing power and influence. And they do it purely for domestic media consumption.The latest coupling with Japan is part of that plan, but it's not the first time Australia has had close military links with Japan. Our ANZACS were escorted across the Indian Ocean by the Japanese Imperial Navy during WW1.

10 Jul 2014 5:23:56pmPhillip, my outrage is not 'mock' it is real and sincerely held.As for the US, any war historian finds it easy to identify US war crimes in any and all conflicts they have engaged in. Consider My Lai, Abu Graib, carpet bombing and poisoning of Vietnam and so on.Saying that 'both sides do it' should not be a justification, nor should it stop people from opposing it at every opportunity.In any case, wars are not nationalistic underneath - they are capitalist. The poor of one country are set against the poor of another country, for the profit of the rich who stay at home and get richer.

10 Jul 2014 5:49:19pmTrue, war crimes are not restricted to just the losing side but it is not true that "winners don't get tried" - look up the My Lai massacre Vietnam 1968 carried out by US troops - but wait they "lost" didn't they?The Japan that existed as our ally and escorted our troop ships in WWI was very different to the Japan that existed in WWII. The military faction that led their government in WWII distorted the traditions and functions of the Japanese military to turn "honour" into murder.

10 Jul 2014 8:24:20pmForgiveness depends on accepting the truth, not rewriting history.  Nobody is saying we should not be friends with Japan.  I love the place, and have good friends there, but as a nation there has never been a full acceptance of what they did, an open and honest education of their children about what they did in WWII, and an ongoing element, including Abe, who attempts to rewrite history whenever they have the chance.China has every right to resent this.  China's own abysmal human rights record does not mean it is OK to pretend the rape of Nanking did not happen nor the millions of others who suffered and died on Japan's failed war of conquest.  That is a separate issue.  It does not let Japan off the hook for what they did, and refusal to admit it and apologise.  That apology may bring some level of forgiveness.

10 Jul 2014 4:40:38pmAbbott's comments were incredibly idiotic, even if they were just a slip of the tongue.  About the only more offensive thing he could do would have been to praise the Einsatzgruppen for their brave work in maintaining social order in occupied Europe.  And the thing is, he hasn't just managed to needlessly antagonise China over this, he's managed to offend a lot of Australian war veterans who haven't forgotten the atrocities that Japan's "brave" soldiers inflicted on their mates during the war.

10 Jul 2014 8:33:05pmSorry Traveller.  Don't believe you.  And whatever abuses were committed by the Allies, there was no match for the Bushido led disregard for a defeated enemy the Japanese army had during WWII.There is no "We all did it" get out of gaol card for Japan on this one.  Slave labour and brutalisation was institutionalised by the Imperial Japanese Army.   No one-off here and there by a soldier/s in the heat of battle who has just seen his friend killed.
Alert moderator
11 Jul 2014 7:04:33amFredn,  You don't believe what?  Yes there is abundant evidence to prove that the Japanese committed some horrible atrocities but that does not mean that we did not respond in kind, the only difference being that with the Japanese most of their atrocities were done up close and personal, brutalising civilians, POW's and mass killings.  We committed our atrocities using more modern methods such as massive fire bombing raids on defenceless Japanese cities where the stated aim was to break the will of the civilian population as most of the cities targeted had little military value. I ask you this, what is more evocative of an atrocity, the image of a baby impaled on a bayonet or the image of a baby burning to death in a firestorm. Like I said no one side comes out of a total war smelling of roses. The reality is that the victor gets to write the history of the conflict.

10 Jul 2014 11:18:14pmIt doesn't matter if "both sides did it". Yes, they did. It was still a stupid thing to say in political and diplomatic terms. Locally, he just stirred up a section of traditional Liberal voters (returned service people of that age). Internationally, he just poked China and most other nations of the Asian region with a stick. He didn't have to say it. He didn't have to mention the war. He could have signed the trade agreement and made with the pleasantries and it would have been done. Instead he chose to forgo Basil Fawlty's advice.
Alert moderator
10 Jul 2014 4:55:08pmWithout in any way trying to excuse the behaviour in the second world war, I think it should be noted that the war ended nearly 7 decades ago, and as a rule any Japanese under the age of around 85 - i.e. the vast majority - could reasonably be considered blameless.I don't think it is helpful for Chinese citizens born after the war to feel that 20 million of their "compatriots" were killed by the Japanese. I'm not sure the definition of compatriot should encompass people who died before you were born.  I agree histories should be as honest as possible, but I strongly feel people and nations shouldn't seek to punish, or take revenge on other peoples or nations for the sins of their fathers.But apart from that, yes it probably was a dumb thing for Mr Abbot to say.

11 Jul 2014 10:18:07amHi Erik,  In response to your "you don't really get it", I guess I have to suggest that you didn't really read it did you?  Nothing I wrote implied we should forget, indeed the statement "histories should be as honest as possible" means I think the full story should be recorded. The single point I am making is to question the wisdom of acting angrily towards people because of things that happened before they were born.  I'm not, by the way, defending, Abbot's statements - they were foolish in my opinion. I am however pointing out that in the article above the author talks about the anger of the Chinese about atrocities against their "compatriots" without any acknowledgement that the vast majority of those feeling angry, and the people they are feeling angry towards, were born after the event.
Alert moderator
10 Jul 2014 8:40:08pmNot quite sure how it is up to you, MFK, when the Chinese should forgive and forget the rape of Nanking, and the millions of other deaths, not to mention destruction.  For a start, maybe after Japan says sorry, we did it and we are sorry.After the Burma Railway POW deaths, you would think Australians would be more understanding of the Chinese on this one.  Maybe the Pacific war seems a little distant to a PM who's British parents would have been more focused on Hitler.  Maybe that accounts for his tin ear on this subject.

There were plenty of other ways he could have praised Japan, because they have had countless achievements before and after the war. Picking the war was incredibly foolish.

10 Jul 2014 5:01:14pmAfter Shinzo Abe said at the press conference that Japan intended to restart their whaling operations in the Southern Ocean, Abbott said "friends can disagree, but they remain friends". What Japan is actually saying to Australia is "we don't care what you think, we don't care about your territorial waters , we'll just do what we want and kill the fauna that you hold dearly"! Friends don't do that to one another, unless they are faking it. Friends resolve their differences. Abbott has lost the plot with this relationship and has been led up the garden path.

10 Jul 2014 5:01:42pmI was born towards the end of WWII.  Relatives of mine fought in the Pacific. My mother who was a nurse knew some of the nurses executed by the Japanese.  As I grew older I worked with men who had fought the Japanese and who had been prisoners of war in places like Changi.  An aircraft of the RAAF squadron of which I was a member was the last out of Ambon when the Japanese invaded.  They summarily executed those who could not be evacuated including its CO. The memories of these things are relatively fresh in my mind and, I suspect, in the minds of many others of my generation. When the Japanese sincerely acknowledge their atrocities and make some amends then I might start to accept them as a "good friend". Instead they seem to be trying to rewrite the history of their part in the war
Alert moderator
10 Jul 2014 5:09:42pmTony Abbott is becoming an embarrassment. Is anyone in the Prime Minister's Office, his Cabinet or even in his own party vetting what comes out when he opens his mouth? The Japanese army did not fight WWII with honour. The mass murder of civilians and POWs is not honourable. When I heard of our PM's latest gaffe, I initially thought that maybe he meant "fought with bravery or courage" but where is the bravery in attacking those who are unarmed and defenceless?It is true that attacks by Japanese soldiers against armed allied soldiers often displayed a suicidal disregard for their own safety but was that "bravery" or simply the actions of brainwashed fanatics. Should we regard the current spate of attacks by suicide bombers (or "murder bombers" as some call them) in the Middle East to be acts of bravery? Perhaps our PM will be prepared to re-interpret those actions as well, particularly if there is a photo opportunity with a future leader from one of those Middle Eastern factions, such as "The Caliphate".It is bad enough that successive Japanese governments have constantly re-interpreted the history or WWII for their domestic audiences without our politicians doing the same for sake of a few friendly headlines overseas - after all, he can't seem to get them here!

10 Jul 2014 5:19:34pmI wouldn't think Mr. Abbott's views carry too much weight. He is, unfortunately, unable to be subtle. Perhaps he carries his boxing and rugby playing attitudes, crash through first and then think later. Remember what he said about Climate Change? To his bunch of like-minded Climate Change skeptics, he reckoned it is all crap. He was as ready to turn around to declare that he is not a skeptic when pressed. My point ? He will tell the Japanese that he just found Australia's best friend while he was in the process of sealing the free-trade deal. I bet he would be equally quick to announce China is Australia's best friend ever when it is time to flog off the free-trade deal.The trouble is, Abbott and Julie Bishop as well, went just that extra bit deeper than necessary. Unless Abbott never bother to dig into a bit of our history, Japan actually invaded Darwin and killed quite a lot of people in the bombing raids. The legendary stories about "Weary Dunlop" in the POW camps, when the brutal Japanese soldiers took much delights in dishing out sadistic treatments to the POW. The POW were reduced to near skeletal walking dead. If he was to cast his sights further North, the brutal killings of Asian neighbours, especially the Chinese peasants, said much about the Japanese soldiers' attitudes to human rights and human lives. What about forcing Korean and Chinese ladies into "Comfort Women"? To date, Japan still haven't fully acknowledged its responsibilities. The visits to the war shrine by Abe is just a clear demonstration of his attitude to Japan's "proud" war efforts? Perhaps trades will wipe the slate clean?

I don't have anything against the Japanese people at least not any more so than I do against those of China or Great Britain or, for that matter, Canada? But to go out there and to praise Japanese military history and its deeds during those decades has got to be one of the most despicable things I have ever seen anyone do.Next thing you know he'll be in Germany praising the honor and skill the German people (glancing of course over historical subtleties like how Nazi does not imply German and neither vice versa) displayed during the holocaust.Once again, another day passes where I and every Australian should be disgusted by this government, but today quite a bit more so than usual.

To truly seek Australia's advantage and our peoples respect.The cultural excuse of japanse military beliefs of no respect do not ring true to me because the men allowed themselves to be captured I do not buy as most of the Japanese went into goverment and business  they did not die with shame!This denial must be challenged families still lve with the consequences as we seek to understand our fathers.Trade yes buth truth about history! with formal respect to our soldiers!

10 Jul 2014 5:52:48pmMay I also add that Japan has still not fully apologised for the crimes of its military during World War 2 including mass rape and murder. Even some of their contemporary politicians have defended such actions. I certainly wont want my sons (or daughters) defending Japan against China when they are remorseless for their actions and China has the opportunity to rectify injustices and inequities of the past.

He reckoned they scuttled DOZENS of Japanese subs, that would try to enter the harbour under convoys of civilian ships. Unfortunately he has passed away, and was only willing to discuss this on a couple of very rare occasions.

But he felt inclined to make silly promises - to make sure? And here we have him again over-egging the pudding where this is not required.This man lacks political acumen and sensitivity to the sensitivity of others. I don't know if he is a 'political psychopath' or not. Perhaps not. But he really comes across as a 24 carat, triple A refined clutz.

10 Jul 2014 6:25:04pmGentlemen, the way I read the article it was not as a lesson in history but in diplomacy - Tony Abbot is not strategic in his comments. Too often he makes an off-the cuff statement with no regard to strategic intent and that nations find offensive. And I really don't think Ms Bishop is much better. This is not an isolated incident. As a nation we should find it extremely embarrassing that our Prime Minister is considered less than adequate in the global arena.

How dare our PM say such things. He does  not speak form me and never will. Never mind upsetting China and South Korea he has offended me and millions of Australians.

I don't agree with your view at all but that's OK because we are still free in the Australia both of our Dads fought for, to agree to disagree. For me, It's not a matter of the PM "speaking for me" or not. I simply think his comments are reasonable and also reflect our own government's recognition of Japanese bravery during WW II. Recognising such bravery does not mean ignoring or forgetting the atrocities and terrible suffering for many people caused by Japanese soldiers.Have a good one.

(pentagon, CIA, whoever).Read up about the history of this in detail. You will find that what I am saying is true.Japan was demilitarised, following its defeat in WWII. But that was a great loss of face. The powerful, warlike people in Japan, like America, turned to the development of nuclear power in a country subject to earthquakes (as we have seen - a disaster) because this kept them supplied with military plutonium for when they could make a comeback.Stage 1: And this is what Abe wants. Those like-minded in Japan are claiming the right to have an army to "protect" others. How noble. How principled. How worthy of Abbott's praise.Stage 2: Japan claims the right to develop nuclear weapons.Stage 3: Here come the War Lords. That surrender. That ignominious defeat. That VJ Day loss of face. Atari!

10 Jul 2014 9:57:14pm500,000 thousand Chinese killed by the Japanese. Terrible and wrong. Unfortunately many more Chinese were killed by communism in fact millions more. How many of your relatives were killed and do hold the Chinese people, communism and the supporters of communist philosophy responsible for their deaths? Or  if you had relatives in China at that time were they ones they doing the killing because many must have been involved? Or is your anger only directed at the Japanese for what they did and you have no issue with millions being killed in China by the Chinese people themselves in far greater numbers and by their own countrymen which is far worse? Perhaps China and the Chinese should start looking at their behaviour and start to accept responsibility for the millions killed for political reasons.

11 Jul 2014 11:10:52amIt's true that democide (death by government) was the leading cause of non-natural death last century and that we should all be aware, upset by, and critical of any government that murders civilians.What Stephen has said is not in any way inconsistent with that sentiment Michael.  What would be inconsistent with that sentiment would be lauding the bravery of particular Japanese soldiers without also describing the atrocities that their countrymen so cruelly perpetrated on civilians and prisoners at the same time - as Tony Abbott so recently did.Stephen is perfectly justified in being upset with Tony Abbott for his omission and I reckon most Australians would agree.

11 Jul 2014 12:40:32pmBut Abbott didn't laud the bravery of soldiers he repeated the words spoken by Admiral Muir-Head Gould who gave the Japanese sailors who manned the mini sub that attacked Sydney Harbour a full military funeral. If Abbott should have mentioned the atrocities that Japan committed in relation to the sailors shouldn't Simon have also mentioned or acknowledged the millions killed in China for political purposes? If those sailors are to blame for the atrocities their countrymen committed is Stephen also responsible for what his countrymen did to their fellow Chinese and at his funeral should it be said that Simon was a nice man for example but it should be remembered that his fellow countrymen killed millions?

If not I will be putting in a complaint to ACMA. The actual quote is this:"Even at the height of World War II, Australia gave the Japanese submariners killed in the attack on Sydney full military honours. Admiral Muirhead-Gould said of them: ?theirs was a courage which is not the property or the tradition or the heritage of any one nation?but was patriotism of a very high order?.We admired the skill and the sense of honour that they brought to their task although we disagreed with what they did. Perhaps we grasped, even then, that with a change of heart the fiercest of opponents could be the best of friends."The quote can clearly be heard on the video on Youtube that the author has obviously not watched.  It was a reference to the military honors given to Japanese submariners during the second world war and the Prime Minister did not once mention Japanese soldiers.

10 Jul 2014 8:35:33pmWhoever wrote tony abbots speech is obviously deficient in history. The Japanese treated china as an Abattoir . The Kempeitai committed atrocities on an industrial scale. They conducted chemical and biological experiments on the general populace and at the end of ww2 their research was confiscated by the US and none of the Kempeitai were charged.The praising of Japanese ww2 service people wasn't just thought it was totally irrational.There comments about the atomic bombs. Brutal yes, but short and sharp. Heard about the Rape of Nanking? Over 5 days of debauchery by these honourable soldiers. More than 300,000 people slaughtered. I could go on but you should by get the point. The irony is that China was our ally. Without China's action the Japanese would have inflicted more damage on Australia and others. So when the war ended did we help our allies! All the countries of Asia that had been occupied by the Japanese? No we ignored them. Kept them as colonies and rebuilt japan as quick as possible. Yes we are a good friend to the Japanese.

10 Jul 2014 8:38:02pmI don't agree with the author. China was our ally in WW II but it's government has more recently committed appalling crimes against its own people. We should mind our "P's & Q's" so as not to upset them? No, I don't think so. Not only that, but because of its support for a North Korean Orwellian state, China indirectly continues to condone terrible "crimes against humanity'. Japan was responsible for many atrocities against the Chinese 70+ years ago, but is now a very different country. As the son of a POW of the Japanese I am supportive of Abbott's position and statements. I accept that some Chinese people may disagree, but my own father also suffered greatly under the Japanese military as a starved, slave labourer building the death railway. We have to move on, and I think it is rubbish not to acknowledge the bravery of many Japanese soldiers while not at all condoning their acts of brutality. Have a good one.

Nevermind China & Korea's justified outrage, one can only imagine how these misguided and offensive comments will play in the USA.Abbott's diplomacy skills on the world stage are pathetic.

In war terrible things happen, this is the nature of war and it is done because you want to win, some of it is extremely cruel but it is done top demoralize the country and its people to help you win.

10 Jul 2014 9:31:09pmI noticed this story didn't bother to provide the original quote or the context and instantly knew it was just another bulldust story trying to manufacture outrage. Here it is for those of you that didn't bother to look it up:In his address to the parliamentary sitting attended by Mr Abe, Mr Abbott cited the bravery of Japanese submariners killed in the 1942 raid on Sydney harbour. "We admired the skill and the sense of honour that they brought to their task although we disagreed with what they did. Perhaps we grasped, even then, that with a change of heart the fiercest of opponents could be the best of friends," Mr Abbott said.So there you go, the comments were specifically about the submariners and it had NOTHING to do with all of the other atrocities committed by the Japanese.Storm in a teacup.

10 Jul 2014 9:38:13pmI note that the author of this article doesn't even use the words that Abbott used. Why not if it as so bad and offensive unless it wasn't.

But of course the Abbott haters are out in force as usual.

10 Jul 2014 9:42:20pmHe shouldn't have said it. Who's he going to praise next, the SS?   The Taliban? There was also a factual error in what he said when he described the Jap submariners as "patriotic'. If they were really patriotic they would have been fighting to overthrow the evil military  dictyatorship that was running their country (Japan) at the time. I ask you, who were the patriots in Germany - those who fought in the Wehrmacht, the Luftwaffe and the SS, or the July plotters like Stauffenberg  who tried unsuccessfully (and paid for it with their lives) to assassinate Hitler. Obviously the  July plotters were the true patriots. Tony Abbott should read a book called Three Came Home by Agnes Newton Keith who spent part of the war in a Jap prison camp in Borneo (with her three year old son) when the Japs invaded.  Some of the Jap guards treated them very badly, and some not so badly. When the camps  were liberated, the female prisoners, (it may have been the male prisoners too) got hold of one of the guards that had been particularly cruel to them and simply beat him to death with their own hands! That was what they thought of Japanese "patriotism".As long as men continue to fight blindly for criminal regimes under the guise of "patriotism" we will always have brutal wars.

10 Jul 2014 9:56:44pmUnfortunately our current PM Tony Abbott is very loose with facts and truth at times. He is also very inept at diplomacy and has not realised the need for tact at times. Maybe if his father or grandfather served in the Pacific war theatre during WW2 and told him some real life experiences he might have been a bit more circumspect. My grandfather served in New Guinea and a next door neighbour while i was growing up was a Changi POW so I understand the sensitivities of many Australians on this issue.In respect of Japan and its PM I can also understand the need to respect their war dead. However, the experiences of China particularly who is a trading partner too would be worthy of some respect by our PM. We do not need to kowtow to Beijing or Tokyo but we do need to balance our relationships carefully.Many comments are being made about PUP Senators and Clive Palmer's suitability for the office they hold at present but if Tony Abbott is not up to international diplomacy then how can he do deal with a hostile Senate?

At one point my grandmother had three sons missing, fate unknown. My mother's brother also served in the Pacific theatre as did many of her cousins and some were killed. That was 70 years ago and people need to move on. As far as I am concerned the PM's comments were entirely reasonable.

10 Jul 2014 9:59:42pmThe memory of WWII and our involvement with the Japanese is still too fresh in our collective memories for Abbott to be making statements like these.   My uncle was beheaded by the Japanese, and my father fought them in the jungles of New Guinea and shared his experiences with us over the years.  Australians have come a long way in fostering contemporary relationships with the Japanese people, which is as it should be. However in the interests of decency, there are some things that are best left unsaid between the countries until time eases the distress.  This is one of them.

10 Jul 2014 10:28:19pmMy Grandfather fought the Japanese in New Guinea and he came home a decimated human being.

It's one thing to let bygones be bygones, another to praise the practices of an evil enemy.

10 Jul 2014 10:36:53pmClearly the Japanese exhibited some sadistic cruelty that one associates with the dark ages. No doubt the Japanese also exhibited bravery and pluck from time to time. Abbott's was an insensitive blunder but not one to get your you-know-whats in a knot. War by definition is a barbarous, criminal, degrading act of bestial cruelty. We only quibble by degree (chopping the head of POWs being lesser than or greater than carpet bombing civilians) and we quibble over perspective, in that only our diggers performed heroic acts of gallantry.

I presume our PM will also praise the Sicherheitsdienst when he next visits Germany.He is worse than an embarrassment, not only to our nation, but to the human race.

Psychopathy lies just below the surface in a 'civilised society' as a rule with blasts into consciousness featuring in the media when significant injustices and abuses are declared.  In today's ghastly world of human affairs such a mind-set (itself unalterable) exists in all social formats in all time zones.I praise our leaders here in Australia even though I might be older than most of them now.  Mr Abbott is no doubt doing his best which is not bad by a long stroke.  Give the man credit.  Dealing with extant awful human realities that carry woeful histories would leave anyone vulnerable to a slip-up especially as a political leader.  Not all things can be said or done at once.

Will we see another article here on the Drum on the disgraceful behaviour of wharfies during the same conflict?This article is little more than a political "beat up", hence my comparison to Jones.Have a good one.

11 Jul 2014 8:05:46amThe outrage aimed at Japan is a tad hypocritical; this outrage is also real to all the original land owners that were within the boundaries of the British Empire as well so why condemn one and not the other. Imagine being move from your country against your will for the service needs of the British Empire, Japan's crimes are still in living memory, the British Empire?s are not and also not backed with film & photographs, point is, why the outrage over Japan and not of British world conquests? I would certainly like to hear a full Japanese apology for the past so long as Britain can stand alongside and give a similar speech. China also remembers gunboat diplomacy; remember England?s love of getting the Chinese hooked on opium, if China resisted the gunboats would go in. Japan herself faced a situation of arming herself or being subjected to a European takeover, they were about the only Asian nation resisting this realism of European greed. They had a belief that Asian should be ruled by Asians and not by European nations and the strange twist is that when war finally did come it was that war with America and a great deal of American presence that did indeed create an Asia free of European dominance and this has suited both Japan & America in terms of free trade. Living in a country that had indeed committed crimes in taking control of it from the original owners is a little hypocritical when condemning Japan for her past one might suggest. Beyond that too, Britain was heavily involved in the slave trade, and to me, that is right up there with anything that Japan or for that matter, Germany did that we eagerly condemn them for. Seems we have forgiven those who had their fingers in this slave trade, or do we just ignore it? I guess we must hate someone, and Japan will always be the fall guy.

11 Jul 2014 8:55:54amThe facts before the acts of Abbott:1. Japanese soildiers could never set their boots on Australian soil (again, after WW2)by law, in any manner or under any pretext.2. Australian's naval defense capabilities were not depending on any country in the Western Asian Pacific neighbouring region where a future military conflict (in any unexpected form of allies) could put Asutralian defence capabilities in jeopody.3. China, Commmunist, red or blue, could never think of targeting their massive land-based contigency tactical missiles towards Australian soil, not even in their wet dream, simply because Australia is and will be irrelevent in whatever wargame plan they'll have in the future other than a popular tourist and investment destination.Facts after the acts of Abbott: (BTW, Thank you, Abbott!)1. By law, Japanese soilders can now, and very possiblely will in the future, set their boots on Australian soil LEGALLY due to "military execises", "mutural port visits",  or "humanitarian assistance"... whatever pretext.2. By buying Japanese subs ( and possiblely many other sensitive  military gears in the future), Japan's military now starts to have (and will have more) critical military info on, hence in full control of, some of Australia's most important defence weaponaries and systems.  -Why not import them from Germany or France?3. Inevitable "joint military execises" and many other whatever "initiatives" between Japanese and Australian navy in sensitive waters such as East China Sea and South China Sea in the near future will be forced to start to make Australian soil a automatic potential target for China's missile troops in case of a serious conflict in the unforseeable future - now Australia is on PLA's radar. Congrads, Abbott!God you have to put a thumb up for the South Koreans. Even already inside a US-Japan-Korea military alliance agreement for decades, they start to smell something very wrong with Abe and want out now, at least preferring sitting on the wall...and Abbott is shaping his head volunteering being the cannon folder of the Yanks, oh no, the Yanks and the Chinese will never have all-out hot war.  Superpowers won't do that. The Japanese were the cannon folders of the Yanks in case of conflicts with China.  Now many thanks to Abbott, Australians will become willing cannon folders of Abe in that case.  It's  magical, isn't it? And China must also be happy to keep sending Australia billions of dollars as if nothing happened... Abbott must be a even more spetacularly gifted individual than you first thought. It's oke to sign such as a deal though, from Abbott's angle at least, but it should have been for Abe to sing the "Admiring" song to show some thanks to his newly-employeed Australian pawns .

11 Jul 2014 9:53:50amFor me the issue is that there was no real need for Abbott to make mention of Japanese soldiers or WW2. The Japanese Government has made an apology on behalf of it's citizens and no more needs to be said except a simple acknowledement of and acceptance of the apology.

11 Jul 2014 10:24:37amDid anyone posting on here actually here what Tony Abbott said? judging by the comments no. He was not praising the whole Japanese army or their exploits he was quoting admiral Murihaed Goulds comments on the Japaneses submarines killed in their midget subs in attacking Sydney harbor. What Tony was trying to say was that even after all the atrocities committed by the Japanese we are willing to forgive and move on and work together. The ABC other media outlets and the people commenting on here are just twisting his words and beating up the story to suite their own anti tony Abbott hatred. The people commenting against his comments have show a complete lack of understanding of what he meant and are just pushing their own anti tony Abbott bloody minded agendas. Very small petty minded people indeed.

The leftist journalists continue to willfully misrepresent everything that is said and they are all trumpeted by a compliant and damaged public broadcaster.

11 Jul 2014 10:44:17amThere was an article right here on The Drum just a few days ago around indigenous massacres in Australia. The overwhelming tenor of the posts was that it was a long time ago and that they should just get over it. There a regular articles on China, to which the majority of blogs say that they are basically an expansionist, warmongering, aggressive, cruel nation of war criminals. Victim and villain, it would seem, are rubbery and interchangeable concepts. Just no-one mention our unprovoked invasions otherwise I won't know what to think.

Not sure whether he said this little speech off his own bat or whether his entourage arranged it for him. Either way he really does need to exercise some tact. He must have known that this was going to offend some sensibilities. It's still not that long ago and the memories are still raw. And of course it doesn't help when you have a Japanese Government that won't formally acknowledge the atrocities, a Japanese people that are largely ignorant of their ignoble past, and Japanese history that completely sanitises it

11 Jul 2014 11:49:48amMany of the comments here display a lack of objectivity.  While crimes were committed by some, Japanese service personnel fought bravely and skilfully.  Who knows if the shabby treatment of the Japanese led by Billy Hughes resulted in them walking away from western norms in treating prisoners. The story is a complex one but let us not deny respect to those Japanese who served their country with honour.

11 Jul 2014 12:02:25pmMy grandfather was killed by the Japanese Army on the Thai-Burma Railway in 1943. He is buried in Kanchanaburi War Cemetery in Thailand.The Japanese starved him and worked him to death in October 1943. No notification of his death was ever made to the Australian Government - it could have been done through the Swiss government as the Germans did. My poor grandmother went down to the Sydney docks in September 1945 hoping to be re-united with her husband after 6 long years only to be told by other survivors that he had died nearly two years before.I have letters from my grandfather dated before the fall of Singapore and then from his CO and fellow soldiers after the return in late 1945. I could write so much more about the Japanese but it was a long time ago now and it serves no purpose to maintain the hate. My father went on to work with Japanese technicians in the 70's. He had to overcome his own anger to do so. I will never accept that the Japanese soldiers of 1934 to 1945 acted honourably. Some may have done so, but we know that the level of cruelty and indifference to human life was callous and heartless. It was systematic and came from the Japanese high command. Their orders were obeyed with a determined obedience by lesser men. The PM got this terribly, terribly wrong.

11 Jul 2014 12:07:06pmMy question is why do any of you think that Japan would want another war?  It took them numerous years to rebuilt after WW2.  I am struggling to understand the justification for people's view that Japan wants to start another war.
Alert moderator
11 Jul 2014 12:29:32pmreason 1:  to save japan's laggard economy with a decades-long cronic deflation and stagnation. The good & old best way is to start a  war. that's what Abe tries.  But they needs a scapegoat, so red-herring "China threat" invented by the US is taken also by Japan's Abe as the excuse to dump Japan's peaceful constitution and rearm its defence complex.reason 2: japan's inability to admit that they won't settle for the top shot in Asia. Earlier industrialization gave japan a leg up against China which was in a prolonged civil wars in the late 19th and early 20th century. This made japan technologically superior to China for the 1st time in Japan's entire history.  This gave japan's elites a false impression that japan is more capable than china, purely for their bloated ego, in spite of the historical fact that japan was a backwater for most of its history compared to china before the arrival of British Industrialization.reason 3: young people in modern japan by and large don't know about their own ww2 history and crimes japan commited across Asia, due to a complete sanitization of their testbook done by a series of japanese govts particularly this Abe regime,  unlike the Germans who have been forced to confront their ww2 past.  So this generation of japnese youths never have had the need to do so, nor realize the true horror of wars,  as they thought they were "heros" - also partly due to the fact that overseas chinese were not strong enough to control wallstreet and the US mainsteam media unlike the jewish do.

11 Jul 2014 1:02:34pmReason 1 - I do not understand why that would be a justification for starting a war.  If your premise about starting a war is credible and given the Japanese economy has been stagnating after the crash in 1989, why wold they choose to start a war now, why would they not have started it before then.  Also, I suggest you have a think about what the general Japanese citizens think about going to war, instead of relying on western media reports?   They do not think about it as they remember terrible WW2 and they do not want another war.Reason 2 - I think you do not understand that Japanese mentality.  The Japanese are always searching for a way to make things better and they will continue to do this, regardless of whether China continues to develop and surpass them as the number 1 economy in Asia (and the world).  You might want to have a look at the fact that Japan is also passing on its technology to China as well.  Japan knows its role in Asia as a peaceful, democratic, advanced nation.  Maybe you might want to pay a visit to Japan to see it with your own eyes.Reason 3 - have you ever seen a Japanese school history textbook or spoken to the younger generation of Japanese about the war?  I would guess the Japanese would know the horrors of war, at least the damage caused by nuclear weapons.  I won't even comment on the conspiracy theories about wall street and the newspapers.

11 Jul 2014 12:10:00pmIt is beyond belief that the appalling behaviour of Japanese soldiers during ww2 could be praised. They may have shown incredible loyalty to their culture and emperor, they certainly showed courage and tenacity but the bottom line is their culturally driven mentality and thus behaviour to fellow humans throughout the East deserves condemnation, not praise.

11 Jul 2014 12:10:24pmIt amazes me that Australians cannot see Japanese aggression during world war 2 in an Asian context.  It was the event that freed Asia from the grip of European Colonialism.  For this the people of Asia are very thankful.But Japan tried to replace this European Colonialism with their own form of colonialism which was just as brutal, if not more so in some cases.  For this the people of Asia are disappointed.  And for those who experienced the worst atrocities of the Japanese, namely China and Korea, there is still lingering anger and distrust.For Australia's part I don't think we can hold any grudge or ill feeling towards the Japanese, who after all thought they were fighting for their very survival and if they failed in their endeavour to create an Asian co-prosperity sphere they expected the worst exemplar of European type colonialism to befall them.  The only Australians we should give the space to hold some resentment are those who experienced atrocities themselves.

11 Jul 2014 12:12:29pmVery disappointing to view & read Mr Abbott's comments regards a past aggressor.  Japan invaded China & then Pearl Harbour by aiming at their heart & vulnerabilities. China was raped, the landscape, their people, China does not forget.  The original fault lies with the aggressor, which was neither China nor USA.USA suffered great loss of life & naval capacity & was catapulted into WW2.Yes, all `soldiers' in war time can be cruel, but the reality for Japanese captives, be they man, woman or child (in huge numbers) was often death or extreme torture or both. Certainly the responsibility lies with the regime, the soldiers like all undoubtedly brain-washed & themselves brutalised by the `powers that be'.   The `world' has moved on from those times(WW2) but we should never forget what occurred & what can occur in future if plunged into war.  Let us not go lightly towards war.Evidence for what occurs is readily available presently in the Middle East, a hell on earth for many.  Let us not `go there' .Australians should not be subjected to our PM making abrasive comments to offend another, mighty nation, to appease present `friends' large or small.  Wrong, insensitive to another `friend' & unnecessary - keep one's mouth sealed when in doubt.I agree with Mr Frazer (previous PM) Australia should remain neutral, we should enter conflict after much reflection & deliberation, neither should we engage in dangerous comment on our sovereign land with `friends' in difficult positions, because to do so may cost us heaps in the decades to come.We have, sadly, turned to Asia for manufacturing as has most of the world, our previous `leaders' thus have made Australia less self-reliant. We are now in a pickle...now is the time to get out of the pickle.The best outcome to present world unrest would be for Australia to reclaim their manufacturing base & become largely self-reliant & thus more secure.  Then our `leaders' will not be placed in a situation where they feel the need to let their tongues loose..I believe Indonesia intends to become self-sufficient...well, if Indonesia can do it, so can we.  We need wealthy Australians to invest in Australia...don't sell off the farm, don't sell off the minerals & gouge out the coal, iron, natural gas & provide cheaply to other nations & multinationals.  Use our natural `wealth' wisely & keep it for future generations, while at the same time developing less toxic fuels - we have the capacity to become solar powered.  Mother Nature will `love' us...& we can rest assured we have done our best for those to come.Leave off other rhetoric, time now to redirect Australian collective energies before it is too late.  For this to occur we need a leader & ruling party which stands for Australia, not for vested interests, not for private gain.

11 Jul 2014 12:17:52pmSome commenters may well evoke the history of the quote, and claim that the statement refers solely to the courage and skill of midget submariners in their attacks on Sydney Harbour.  However, out of that time context, the broad statement has to be considered highly disrespectful of all those who died in the pacific, not as combatants, but as prisoners in horrific circumstances. However, the overshadowing issue will be geopolitical.  How this statement is interpreted by our other trade partners in the Asia Pacific.  China, with whom we maintain a relatively important trade relationship has a demonstrated tendency to react badly to any percieved praise for Japan, or memorialising their actions during the war. The memories of the Rape of Nanking are worn very close to the surface.  While most of the countries in the region which felt the brunt of Japanese Imperialism will take this statement with a grain of salt, it has the capacity to seriously sour the China relationship.The Japan alliance is undoubtedly important from a strategic point of view, and outlining our desire to continue a close partnership is relevant, but elevating it to the level of an ANZUS style strategic partnership is a clear indication of hedging against China.  Australia would be better placed to use our middle power status to encourage better diplomatic relations between China and Japan, in an effort to ensure stable future relations and growth in the region (as well as stable trade for Australia).

11 Jul 2014 1:26:14pm"At that time, it was Japan that posed the threat, managing to attack as far south as Darwin."That's an understatement. The Japanese tried to get into Sydney Harbour using midget submarines. They definitely bombed Townsville and I've heard stories of dog fights in the skies over the Atherton Tablelands between the Japanese and the allies.

11 Jul 2014 2:57:32pmAbbott was specifically referring to the Japanese submariners that attacked Sydney harbour in WW2.  Not the general conduct of Japanese soldiers throughout the war.Does anyone question the courage of the Australian submariners during WW1 that sat in the middle of the Turkish Dardanelles Straits and, under constant attack from Turkish warships, managed to sink a number of enemy vessels?I doubt it.  But don't let facts get in the way of a good political attack.
