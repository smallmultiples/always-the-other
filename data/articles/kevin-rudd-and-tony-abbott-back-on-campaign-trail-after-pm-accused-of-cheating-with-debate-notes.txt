Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Opposition Leader Tony Abbott are back on the campaign trail this morning after both claiming victory in the first election debate.Last night's exchange at the National Press Club in Canberra had a heavy emphasis on the economy and who could be trusted to best manage it.The Prime Minister promised to introduce a bill on same-sex marriage within 100 days of being re-elected, while the Opposition Leader said he would make a decision on a second airport for Sydney in his first term of government.Today Mr Abbott was at Melbourne's traffic management centre where he reaffirmed his commitment to provide $1.5 billion for the East West road link.He said he wanted to be known as an "infrastructure" prime minister, if elected, and that the project would ease congestion and boost productivityMeanwhile the Coalition has taken a swipe at Mr Rudd, claiming he cheated by using notes during last night's debate.According to the rules "the leaders may have a pen and paper on the lectern and no other documentation or props".KRudd can't even keep basic promise on 'no notes' for #debate as he read his opening speech closing speech and most of it in between!â€” Julie Bishop (@JulieBishopMP) August 11, 2013It was up to moderator David Speers to pull Mr Rudd up on the rule breach, but he failed to do that on the night.News Limited has reported Mr Speers has apologised for not taking action at the time.The Prime Minister insists he complied with the rules. "The PM arrived at lectern in full view of the audience and the panel," a spokesperson for Mr Rudd said in a statement."There were no objections raised at any time. We have always believed this rule is aimed at preventing the use of props."Less than 10 minutes after the debate ended, the Coalition campaign headquarters declared its man had won the night.Mr Abbott said "it was a great opportunity to present some plans to the Australian people", but said he wanted more debates where the "people of Australia" could ask the questions.Mr Rudd said "it was for the Australian people to decide" how well - or not - he had performed.Today, Mr Rudd is in Sydney visiting the marginal liberal seat of Bennelong where Labor's candidate is Chinese-Australian lawyer Jason Yat-sen Li. Mr Rudd is expected to make an announcement about jobs after the China resources boom. Two new opinion polls this morning show there has been no movement in support for the major parties after the first week of the campaign. Newspoll, published in The Australian, has the Coalition leading Labor 52 per cent to 48 per cent after preferences.That is the same as last week's Newspoll result and mirrors another national poll conducted by Nielsen during the first week of the campaign.In the latest Roy Morgan poll also published today, both parties are locked at 50 per cent each.Both results are within the margin of error.Newspoll showed Kevin Rudd remains well ahead of Tony Abbott as preferred Prime Minister, although most of the 1,100 voters questioned believe the Coalition will win the election.Greens leader Christine Milne said she did not think either leader won the debate, which lacked compassion.She said: "The elephant in the room was poverty, disadvantage, compassion, kindness." Ms Milne also said voters would have benefitted from hearing the Greens' plan and from a party in Australia "that takes the science seriously and wants to see a very significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions".Bob Katter, leader of Katter's Australian Party, was critical of the debate because he and other minor parties were not allowed to participate.The elephant in the room was poverty, disadvantage, compassion, kindness He has also denied rumours the party has done a preference deal with Labor saying no firm decisions have been made.Billionaire businessman Clive Palmer said the leaders failed to talk about delivering any "real changes for our society or delivering any benefits for our citizens".Meanwhile the Nationals Leader Warren Truss is today embarking on a tour of key seats in Queensland.The party's prime target is Capricornia, which is currently held by retiring Labor MP Kirsten Livermore on a margin of less than 4 per cent.Mr Truss is due to visit the electorate and promise $300,000 for Meals on Wheels in Rockhampton. He will then head north to Proserpine, in Dawson, where Nationals MP George Christensen is fighting to hold on to his 2 per cent margin.
