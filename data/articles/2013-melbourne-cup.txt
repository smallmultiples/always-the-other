The favourite Fiorente delivers Australia's first lady of racing, Gai Waterhouse, her first Melbourne Cup victory. Ridden by Damien Oliver, the six-year-old stallion finished one better than last year, and came home ahead of Red Cadeaux in second and Mount Athos in third. Part owner Barry Pang also made history, becoming the first Chinese Australian to win the Melbourne Cup. And there's always more to Melbourne Cup Day than the horses. Race goers parade their own silks and colours for a spash of glamour around Flemington.
