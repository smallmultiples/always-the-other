Defence Department head Nick Warner has defended his inquiry into claims department staff secretly investigated Minister Joel Fitzgibbon, saying it is being conducted with "total professionalism".Fairfax newspapers have today reported that hundreds of Department officials are being made to sign statutory declarations confirming they were not involved in, or knew of, any covert operation.The move is reported to have angered some who believe it is a "witch-hunt".Mr Warner has confirmed in a statement that over 200 staff have been interviewed and another 850 have signed statutory declarations saying they had no knowledge or involvement in any operation."The investigation is being conducted with total professionalism," he said."Technical oversight is being provided by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). External security intelligence and law enforcement agencies have been consulted, and the Commonwealth Ombudsman has been briefed."Mr Warner says the investigation is close to being finalised but will not be released before Easter.Just a few days after the initial claims surfaced, an interim report released on March 27 found no evidence to support them.Mr Warner says this is still the case."If I receive any information supporting the allegations of criminal activities by Defence personnel I will immediately refer this matter to the Australian Federal Police," he said."Defence will continue to support the independent review by the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security. We are regularly briefing him on progress of the Defence inquiry."The Defence Department opened an investigation after it was reported that department staff investigated Mr Fitzgibbon's relationship with Chinese-Australian businesswoman Helen Liu over concerns their friendship posed a security risk.Mr Fitzgibbon was subsequently forced to apologise after admitting that he had not declared that Ms Liu paid for his travel to China in 2002 and 2005.The Opposition have repeatedly called for Mr Fitzgibbon to be sacked, but Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has so far stood by Mr Fitzgibbon.
