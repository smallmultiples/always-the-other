Had the idealistic former Australian soldier, Caner Temel, not died while fighting in Syria, he would have run afoul of a little-known law that monopolises our government's use of force, writes Stephen Dawson. It all depends on who you're fighting for.One definition of "government" is the national institution with a legal monopoly on force. If I kill you, my action is illegitimate and I can be punished. If an agent of the government kills you in accordance with the rules set by the government, then there can be no punishment. That's unfortunate for you.The Fraser Government went international with that. It passed the Crimes (Foreign Incursions And Recruitment) Act 1978, which outlawed Australian citizens and residents fighting on certain sides in foreign wars.That would have been bad news for Caner Temel, the young idealistic former Australian soldier, had he not died in January while fighting in Syria. That was a foreign war in which he was fighting, and he was on the wrong side from the point of view of Australian law.The right side under the law would have been "in any capacity in or with ... the armed forces of" the Syrian Government.In short, the law criminalises an Australian fighting a foreign regime, but not an Australian working for a foreign regime in fighting others.Were an Australian to sneak into North Korea and blow up a statue of Kim Jong-Un, he (or she, but to be fair it is more often he) would be subject to up to 20 years in prison if he manages to get back here. Yes, it's right there in paragraph 6(3)(d) of the Act: engaging in hostile activities includes "unlawfully destroying or damaging any real or personal property belonging to the government of the foreign state or of a part of the foreign state."They also include injuring a public office holder of the foreign State (6(3)(c)). Or terrorising the population (6(3)(b)) or, you know, actually fighting the foreign State (6(3)(a) and (aa)).Unless, of course, you are an Australian service person under orders, then you can go inflict all the mayhem the Australian Government wants on specified foreign officials and statues. Had Australian troops arrived in Baghdad first in 2003, they could have pulled down Saddam's statue without fear of this Act.But had a group of Australian irregulars snuck into Iraq a week or two before and dynamited Saddam's statue, they could have faced a couple of decades in jail back home.If, that is, the Attorney General of Australia were to authorise prosecution. This is another one of those many Acts where criminal prosecution is subject to the approval of the Attorney General. Read his or her mind correctly in advance and you can get away with it. Maybe.Between 1936 and 1939 at least 66 idealistic Australians journeyed to Europe to join the tens of thousands of other foreigners participating in the Spanish Civil War. Ten of the Australians were women. At least three dozen were known to have served with the International Brigades, actually fighting on the Republican side.As it happens, the Republican side was that of the government elected in 1936. Its opponents included factions that had been the previous government of 1935. And none of that matters under the Act. Had the Crimes (FIAR) Act been then in place, the "government" would have been "the authority exercising effective governmental control" over "the part of that foreign state" in which the action was happening (s.3). That war started with a messy, incomplete coup, so over the next three years "effective governmental control" was in an extreme state of flux over this area or that.More recently, and in a time to which the law actually did apply, had an Australian fought with Robert Mugabe against the Rhodesian Government of Ian Smith at any point after April 14, 1978, when the law commenced, his actions would have been quite illegal. But had an Australian joined the Mugabe administration in 1983 to join its brutal military action against its Ndebele opponents, all would have been fine.Arguably the Australian Government has an interest in avoiding the embarrassment of large numbers of Australians joining a conflict in which it is neutral, or even inclined towards one side or another, without wishing active involvement. But in practice this law attempts to extend the monopoly on force, as it applies to Australians, throughout the world.You can fight for the Australian Government. You can fight for a foreign government. But you can't fight against a foreign government. No matter how disgusting it may be. No matter how much you feel a call from your moral sensibilities or from your God to put your life on the line for what you believe to be the good.Indeed, although it has been out of fashion these past four decades, the Australian Government could legislate in order to conscript you to fight against those with whom you are in sympathy.I referred earlier to Caner Temel as idealistic. That is an assumption. But I think it a fair one. He apparently chose to risk his life - actually in the sense of facing bullets - in pursuit of what he saw as his allegiance to his God. The risk turned into reality.I think he was very wrong indeed, and I certainly don't follow his God. But should the Australian Government deny such people the legal right to put their lives on the line for what they perceive to be right?Stephen Dawson is a freelance writer from Canberra.

21 Mar 2014 9:09:49amI'd always had doubts about your little toe so it's just as well that you don't define what it means to be (an) Australian. We have people going to off to fight in wars with the Americans simply because they're told to. Some others go off to fight because they personally believe in it. I see little difference been them and I have little interest in either.

Others see it as a way to get a uni degree or a trade skill. There are of course many reasons why people join the military.Though I doubt any professional soldiers really care about who they are fighting and certainly haven't joined up for ideological reasons.I'm also sure that to a man/woman they all think the age old thought "yeah people die in wars, but fortuantely it won't be me".

He is no great loss to the nation.  On the bigger issue the Australian Government should have a monopoly on force and it should go even further.  Australians should be barred from serving in the armed forced of foreign governments unless they are ADF personnel on official attachement to the other force and hence sanctioned by the Australian Government.  If that causes conflicts of interests for so called Australians then they need to decide where their loyalty lies and then act - once and for all.  Feel free to leave these shores and fight but don't bother coming back.

21 Mar 2014 7:35:42pmCaner Temel simply did what we ultimately expect of all soldiers, except he did it for another cause. Is he really so different from anyone else who gave their life in this manner ?I am a current serving member, previously Infantry & at risk of being politically incorrect, quite anti-Islam, for my own reasons. A statement of support for a person killed in action doesn't mean you supported every other part of their life. It shows simply, that there are many parts to a person & in this part he gave his life for the cause he believed in. Why do you think we honour the unknown soldier ? Is it because we acknowledge the fact that people die in conflicts & we must remember that they had a family, that they are missed & grieved like any other ? Or is it because the unknown soldier fits some narrow notion that the only people who die are our own & they were all fantastic people who were just like us ? Caner Temel broke his oath, we have ways & means of dealing with that. He was administratively discharged, would never have been able to re-join the ADF or serve with another gov' agency.  It has happened before & will happen again. He went overseas & fought outside of the jurisdiction of the ADF or Aust gov't. That happens all the time too, there are hundreds, if not thousands of Australian ex-military personnel working as private security contractors around the world. Is their allegiance still to Australia or do they now do the bidding of their employer ? Are they traitors ? Of course not. I joined the Army voluntarily, just as I may leave if I wish. If my ideals about the situation change then I would do so quite easily. Would I be a traitor because I chose another path? I swore allegiance to the Queen, yet I would vote for our country become a republic, am I a traitor ?  Ofcourse not.

The authority to instigate the application of military force, exercised by the ADF, is merely delegated by the Australian people to the Australian government. That is what it means to have a representative democracy.It is an authority that the government holds in trust and it should bear in mind that the Australian people retain every right to rescind that authority, by whatever means necessary.By whatever means.

21 Mar 2014 1:25:43pmA good reason for Australia to stop the practice of permitting our citizens to hold dual citizenship.

21 Mar 2014 4:51:47pmWow, Wikipedia, the most reliable source of incontravertable facts on earth...There are still plenty of Mosques in Singapore today CP, perhaps taking a trip away from Orchard Road might show you some more about the country.Mandarin and English are the main spoken languages because 1) since being kicked out of the Malaysian Federation in the 60's Singapore has been 'ruled' by the same chinese family 2) Singapore's policies are pro-chinese rather than pro-equality (due to 50 years of rule by 1 political family, whoops I meant party) 3)Singapore is a trading hub and a regional centre for commerce in the Asia Pacific and hence English and Manadarin are more commonly spoken 4) the Chinese migrants to Singapore don't bother to learn the local language (prior to the 60's everyone spoke Malay which was the only common language spoken amongst all the different races).Of the total population of Singapore, which includes approx 2.5m migrant workers and approx 3.7m citizens, the total population that is muslim is about 40%, as about 14% of the local citizens are Malay (muslims) and over 2m of the migrant workers are from Bangladesh (muslims), so in total numbers it is the largest religion practiced in Singapore.I like my in-laws plenty CP and I've learned a lot about their country of birth, its history and its present. And nothing that you quoted changes the fact that I personally know males who were born in Singapore have never done national service and have returned to Singapore on holidays and have never had any problems with the government. If you are a resident citizen of Singapore, then you have a positive obligation to do national service, but there is no positive obligation to go back there just to do it.

21 Mar 2014 10:28:20amLast I heard, Australia accepts dual citizenships with at least a few nations, so in that case at least citizenship does and should not require abdication of other allegiance.

21 Mar 2014 9:39:48amI believe that the fact that a young person from Australia feels a need to go back to his originating country (I presume) reflects somewhat on his feeling of non-inclusion in Australian society.  Australia is losing the tolerance it once had to succeeding waves of migrants encouraged in by Government.  This is unfortunate in terms of hopes of a settled and ordered society in the future.We should not lose sight of the benefits other cultures bring to our shores.  In fact we probably do not realise how much our current way of life owes to these benefits.  A few undesirable people should not outweigh the good people coming here, or the emphasis on education such families place on their children.

21 Mar 2014 9:40:25amYour line about 'avoiding the embarrassment of... joining a conflict in which it is neutral' is on the right track. Obviously this is a diplomatic minefield. Yes there are horrible regimes out there that probably deserve to be toppled, but effective diplomacy is the morally preferable way of doing so. Giving citizens of any country a licence to travel the world following their idealistic viewpoints would be a recipe for disaster. Yes our politicians and diplomats often appear to lack the willpower to force real change in these foreign regimes. But that doesn't mean we should all fly over to Crimea/Syria/Sudan, pick up guns and enact regime change ourselves. That would make us just as culpable, morally, as the regime itself. Two wrongs don't make a right, unless of course you subscribe to any of the various religious creeds whose differing interpretations of old stories underlie much of the violence we see in the modern world.

21 Mar 2014 9:45:15am" But should the Australian Government deny such people the legal right to put their lives on the line for what they perceive to be right?"Nobody is stopping this.  Anyone can go to Syria and stand up in Damascus and denounce the government and its actions.  That would probably lead to arrest and possibly death, though Australian citizenship would help dodge that.All that is prevented is joining irregular fighting forces.  You can go and provide medical assistance, (according to relatives, this is very popular - strange that photos show the individuals armed to the teeth and statements glorifying death are published).  Or publish propaganda. Or simply hold a placard.Overall, however, I am unclear as the objective of the writer.  Is he willing to scrap the law?  Or just for those issues he likes?  I seem to remember these laws were introduced at a time that many Australians were going to the Balkans to fight in the conflict there (on all sides).  Does he suggest that Australia should approve of its citizens fighting for any group they "morally" support?

21 Mar 2014 9:45:52amThanks for the clarification, I hadn't realised the law only sanctioned those fighting for the rebel team.A law that permits Australians to fight for the army of a foreign state seems to me to be a bad law with no logical or moral basis.It is an invitation for Australian citizens to bring Australia into disrepute.

21 Mar 2014 9:55:17amStephen Dawson, for an international lawyer you make a pretty good freelance writer.Under international law, Combat immunity only applies to combatants who obey the Laws of Armed Conflict.  Principal among these are the targeting principles of distinction (between civilians and combatants), military necessity (don't shoot stuff for fun) and proportionality (don't use a bomb when a bullet will do the trick).For "distinction" to work, it is necessary to put on a uniform and carry arms openly.  This is why those fighting in foreign militaries, run by foreign governments, may receive combat immunity.  They are clealry identifying themselves as combatants.  By doing so, they are clearly saying "I am not a civilian.  You may try to kill me, but I'll try to kill you back."The only times civilians can become combatants is during a Levee en Masse, which is an uprising of civilians *of the nation* against a governing power.An Australian who goes overseas to join some sort of rebellion is neither fighting for a military in uniform, nor are they part of a levee en masse.  They are therefore not lawful combatants under international law.  If they kill, other than in self-defence, it is murder.On the other hand, an Australian who joins an overseas military, provided it is not at war with Australia, is at least required to distinguish themself from civilians, and is expected (along with the rest of the military) to comply with Laws of Armed Conflict.The Fraser legislation quite simply reflects Australia's obligations under those international laws who main purpose is to protect civilians and their property in time of war.I have no problem with you opposing the current form of those laws, but I would like to see that objection come from a much more informed place than this article.

Think the balkans, think Syria, think of Iran, think of South America and the CIA....I get your point but this:"On the other hand, an Australian who joins an overseas military, provided it is not at war with Australia, is at least required to distinguish themself from civilians, and is expected (along with the rest of the military) to comply with Laws of Armed Conflict."Holds no weight when neither side is obeying the principals when international law is clearly being ignored...The most clear and recent example is probably the stream of people who went back to Sri Lanka and fought with the Tamils....Where to the Tigers of Tamil lie?

I am guessing that there are more than a few Lebanese Australian who may have breached this, for example. Why on Earth would we want to waste our time and money on chasing down such people?

Both sides are insane and hell bent on destroying a once beautiful prosperous country and forcing their women and children to flee over borders while expecting the UN and other groups to pick up the pieces of their total selfishness.The reason you can fight in an ARMY in a foreign country as an Australian citizen is because even if you are naturalised and second generation born in Australia but have say a Greek background, you must as a male do 2 years of compulsory National service. I also resent your comment that Australian soldiers can reek mayhem in foreign countries. Soldiers are UNDER ORDERS not free agents killing people for fun. I suggest you have a look at what Australian soldiers have really done in Afganistan and around the world which is mainly building schools, bridges, roads and hospitals. They are not there in a " rambo" capacity as the idiots who go to Syria from here are doing. They sbould never be allowed back into the country.

Alert moderator
21 Mar 2014 11:00:16amGrandMaster,I presume that by "Geneva Convention" you mean the international laws of armed conflict (there's more than just the Geneva Conventions).  If someone fights by taking up arms without also wearing a uniform, they've breached those laws *already*, before a shot is fired.  The reason for this is that it becomes impossible to distinguish fighters form civilians, and this puts the innocent at risk.  This is why the Laws of Armed Conflict require combatants to wear a uniform or distinctive symbol, and carry arms openly.You can't have it both ways.
Alert moderator
21 Mar 2014 12:28:06pmSpies (ASIO, ASIS, CIA, MI5, ...) regularly take up arms without wearing a uniform.  Are they all in violation of these international laws?  If so, of what use are the laws?Modern miliary uniforms are designed to be *camoflage*, not to allow combatants to be distinguished from civilians.A central point of the orignal article is that the notion of "government" is very ill-defined in times of civil war, and has nothing to do with who obeys international law.  I believe that in Iraq, the Taliban were providing governement functions (e.g., social security) in the areas they controlled.  What about Ukrane?  Crimea?  Who is the "government" there?  Both sides have people in and out of uniform.

21 Mar 2014 1:56:36pmNot really, still is a combatant thus is covered under the Geneva Convention.And you are right there are more but normally it refers to the convention covering combat.This convention is hampering with operations for the reason that various combatant do not uphold it.Most conflict there is no more distinct difference between combatants other then shooting/carrying arms.And no, no need for torture i can make some one wear a tin foil hat just by being the color full character that is me.Also modern(partially covered by Lachlan) sole purpose is to camouflage the person(s) even rank/unit badge are within this color pattern and can only be seen through scope/binoculars or being in arm length distance.It is a old practice to shoot the rank and not file by snipers to demoralize and hinder command and control.And this is not by having it both ways this is about justice, derived from the word "just".One most distinct that fighting or defending the innocent is not a crime but a moral duty.Religion does play a role but it should not be seen as a excuse to prosecute, extremism yes that should be dealt with the up most care and vigilance.And believe me i know what i am talking about i am widely respected among the FSA, former Libyan rebels and other normal Muslims On the other hand the extremist want me dead and i outrank allot of high placed officials on various hit lists.

21 Mar 2014 4:11:02pmIf a combatant fails to identify themselves as a combatant, it's considered perfidy under the Geneva Conventions.Armed conflicts are supposed to have rules. If you can't comply with the rules, it means you can't legally participate in the conflict. And doing so is grounds for punishment.

21 Mar 2014 8:21:11pmNo one will identify them self to begin with as it defeats the whole purpose of wearing camouflage, thus anyone will be in violation then.Ranks and Unit badge are also in camo these days making it harder to spotNever heard of a sniper that showed some from of identification either, specially a good one you will never see him.So by your explanations all soldier's, nco and officers are in breach.What seems odd, and those laws are amended that people now are placed under combatant and none-combatant.With a combatant partaking in combat in any shape or form and a none-combatant does not.
Alert moderator
21 Mar 2014 10:54:20amThe law is reasonable as far as it goes but perhaps it can be strengthened by outlawing combat in any foreign force not formally sanctioned by the government. Conversely the government might formally sanction volunteer military support to another organisation where it is strongly in Australia's interests. A ggod example is the American Volunteer Group (the flying tigers) who were US citizens fighting for the Chinese against the Japanese just before the outbreak of the Pacific war. The US government not only sanctioned its citizens fighting for the Chinese but also allowed the sale of aircraft to the Chinese. Australian citizens should be fully aware that it is the Australian government who decides who you can fight for.  To go against this should be seen as an act of treason.  Hence people who do this should recognise that their loyalties now lie elsewhere and any return to Australia as an Australian citizen will result in a lengthy prison sentence.

21 Mar 2014 10:55:18amComing up for ANZAC Day, we'll be remembering when all Australians, as Britishers, were fighting for a foreign power -- with whom we had a relationship. Certainly the backing of our government had legitimacy behind that conflict (and the many others we have served in). However, many of our war heroes were those who were captured by the Germans during WW2, then released. They took the choice to fight for the resistance movements in countries like Italy, and fought heroically against the government in a movement that was not officially approved of by the Australian government.The many citizens who fought in Spain (such as George Orwell) did so for the same reasons that people are fighting in Syria.I'm not saying I approve of the actions of the Australian Syrians who fight, but I can understand why they do (So could any Australian of Irish origin who still follows developments in Ireland). They are soldiers of their conscience. Becoming an Australian does not divorce one from one's past, and Australia has a proud tradition of allowing people to follow their consciences.

But who knows, we hear a lot about suicide - I have been wondering for a while whether the eagerness in some of these young blokes isn't a subdued wish to die and if they couldn't get into these theatres of war, they'd commit suicide in another way. Or they just can't resist a fight, and sorry, it's better they fight in Syria than in Cronulla.

Alert moderator
21 Mar 2014 11:32:33amSeems to me the author is mixing up a few concepts.The rules of war (and the Geneva Conventions) are pretty clear.  Legitimate members of a nation's armed forces, and partisans who observe certain basic rules, are entitled to the protection of the Conventions, specifically Geneva 3.  That means that if you join the Syrian Army, you can legally kill people in the course of legitimate military action.However, it doesn't give you a free ride.  You can certainly be tried for war crimes or crimes against humanity.  That applies to anyone serving in any  army.Foreign fighters who are not actually members of the army, on the other hand, do not enjoy quite the same level of protection, unless they are clearly designated as  members of a fighting force and carry their arms openly.  Otherwise, they don't get the protections of Geneva 3, and will be treated in international law as non-combatants. If a non-combatant kills someone, whether it's a war crime or  not, he can be tried in a court of law for murder. And if the person is a mercenary, he gets no legal protection whatsoever.  He can simply be shot.The International Brigades of the Spanish Civil War would clearly fall within the legitimate combatants entitled to Geneva Convention protections. That is very different from "idealistic" young men bombing market places or shooting civilians, no matter which side they happen to be fighting on in Syria.  They are entitled to a fair trial but nothing more.Bottom line:  unless you're fighting under conditions which fit Geneva 3,ie you're a lawful combatant, I reckon you ought to be treated like anyone else who commits a crime of violence. And if you do fight under the conditions of Geneva 3, you should still face accountability for any war crimes you are involved in, and I don't care which side you fight on.

Are you saying that it should be OK for Australians to fight against a foreign government or  that it shouldn't be OK to fight for a foreign government. Or are you just pointing out the inconsistency?If its just the inconsistency then I imagine its simply because the issue of Australians traveling overseas to fight for a foreign government hasn't come up much so there hasn't been the need for a law about it. I'm sure the government doesn't want Australians traveling all over the world taking up arms and causing trouble. Seems pretty sensible and obvious to me.

21 Mar 2014 2:59:31pm'An extension of your argument is that citizens should be allowed to use lethal force domestically, and not just the police.'What possible logic is there that denies any law abiding citizen the right to use lethal force in defence of their life and liberty or the lives and liberty of others in the face of violent aggression? Remember that the authority of the police to use lethal force devolves from a mandate from the masses. As a citizen I share the right to authorise police officers to act in my stead and use lethal force where needed.  It does not follow that in delegating that authority to police officers, I surrender my own right to use lethal force when needed.I have seen a sheep lie down patiently and have its throat cut, but I have never seen a lion do it.

Did he do this deliberatley under false circumstances for the puropoes of gaining experience so as to use this knowledge? Dangerous. Australia and America share free deomcratic values that needs to be protected, terroist organisations are simply fighting for extreme radical beliefs. Choose.

21 Mar 2014 1:05:09pmSince a few commenters here have raised the question of citizenship, and serving in a country's armed forces, it might be worthwhile to note that the Australia government conscripted non-citizens into the armed forces during the Vietnam War, and many of them fought for Australia.Nobody was required to have Australian citizenship to be conscripted by the Australian government.

21 Mar 2014 1:06:49pmThe US and Allies break the law when it suits them to invade Iraq. The Russians do the same in Crimea. Their motive is power and hegemony. The Russians currently supply arms to the Syrian govt. The US/Britain/France supply arms to the rebels. Guess who else also fights on the rebels team? Yep. Old mate Al Queada. Short memories, huh?And one mans terrorist is another mans freedom fighter. It's all about persepctive. Governments will attempt to manipulate your perspective via the media depending on their motives, which, most of the time you and I will never really be told about.The overall point being that governments who make laws about people who go to fight these wars for whatever reason is hypocritical at best and probably a crime in itself. But when you make or break the laws to suit your objectives it's all irrelevant anyway. Time for people to wake up and call BS on most of the stuff our governments claim to do for the greater good.

21 Mar 2014 2:03:29pmI don't think it's about perception, I think it's about the rules of war.  Those may not be great, but they're all we've got, and they distinguish mightily between regular armed forces, resistance fighters, unrecognized and unlawful combatants, and mercenaries.  Any laws we have ought to make the same distinctions.

21 Mar 2014 7:46:44pmNo, I don't think I missed the point.  The Act accepts that Australians may serve in the armed forces of a foreign country and not be violating the terms of the Act.  The Minister, however, has the authority to designate that foreign country which would mean, you enlist in their army, and you're violating the Act.From what I can see, however, insurgents who choose to fight with one side or the other without being part of a formal national army, are in violation of the Act, no matter which side they serve on.  That's consistent with the Geneva Conventions which distinguish between soldiers and non-military combatants.I'd say, keep it simple. Anyone who fights in an overseas insurgency anywhere violates the act;  anyone who serves in a foreign army is facing the risk that the government will designate that army as an exception to the act.  And anyone, part of rebel  group or of a foreign army, who gets himself involved in war crimes, loses the protections of the Conventions regardless of whether he's a soldier, a "freedom fighter" or a mercenary.The

21 Mar 2014 1:26:22pmThis legislation is quite interesting. David Hicks could have been pinged on this if it wee not for the fact that the Taliban were recognised as the legitimate government of Afghanistan despite some claiming they were not. (im not a Hicks hater im just making an example)The legislation is interesting in that it views as illegal any citizen fighting against a foreign government even if they are actually the 'bad guys'. I can only assume this law was brought in to distance Australia from any such instance because if we didnt recognise such action as criminal and attempted to defend our citizen who was involved in an attack on a more powerful state then it could put Australia in a difficult position.  As I understand it, Temel had not discharged from the Army before going abroad to fight. He swore an oath of alligience and duty and he broke it....he's not the first to do this and he wont be the last, but he really should have discharged before doing so. I dont see this issue in people going abroad to fight, but to fight with a group who Australia considers terrorists makes such action awfully hard to justify regardless of how heroic or brave it might be.How about this for a complicated scenario...say someone goes to Ukraine to fight against the interim government whose legitimacy is questionable. The person returns to Australia and was arrested and tried - the legitimacy of the regime would be crucial to the case and could be grounds for the defence to question, with the court making a determination.

If these people want to go back overseas and commit crimes or continue the practices that made them enemies of their own countries they will then be correctly identified and have no access to  Australian consular and political help.

Alert moderator
21 Mar 2014 3:41:54pmTo be honest, I don't think the state or society in general are any more violent - we just have easier access to information, and to media hype, and maybe our impression is out of kilter with reality.  We tend to imagine that street violence is on the increase in Aus (and most western societies) , but the figures don't really bear that out.  We also think the police are  more violent, yet I think that too is more because their transgressions come to public notice faster, than because they commit more transgressions. And while there's certainly plenty of violence in the Middle East, Afghanistan and elsewhere, we've not had a war on the scale of the World  War's for over half a century.  That has to count for something.

21 Mar 2014 2:20:09pmI think if you spent just 1 day in a country not as blessed as ours, Syria is a good example, you'd realise why we have decided to "monopolise" the use of force. We live in a country that we don't have to worry if a group of soldiers will walk in to our village and steal loot and kill indisciminately. Spend a day in the CAR, Uganda, Nigeria, Somalia, Syria, even closer nations like the Phillippines (southern Mindanao, yes I've spent time there), PNG (the highlands, or even as "civilised" as Port Moresby). You will see what it is like when a government is corrupt and bad.The Australian government protects it's people, and Australian troops sacrifice their family life, and sometimes their lives, in order to protect. Saddam was evil, and his regime was corrupt and oppressive. The taliban were indeed incredibly brutal and oppressive of women. Fancy being raped and then executed because you came out about it? No thanks. I'd prefer to live in a country where I'm protected. If a soldier in Australia hits a civilian, the punishment to that soldier is the same as to that of a civilian hitting a civilian. If a citizen fights against our government, it is wrong, unless our government is abusing human rights, which it does not. For those complete morons who say that ASIS, ASIO etc take up arms. Read the ISA (intelligence services act), no they don't take up arms when not in identifying clothing. ASIO when taking up arms are uniformed, and ASIS specifically do not take up arms. Please stop making uneducated, ignorant statements. Appreciate the freedom you have to speak on this forum without being put in jail like another country would happily do.

21 Mar 2014 3:32:46pmOne interesting complication is David Hicks.  When he joined up with the Regular Army in Afghanistan, the Taliban were the recognised government in that country.  So far, he was totally legal.Then the Australian Government took a dislike to the Taliban.  But they were still 'in effective control' of Afghanistan, and Australia had not made a formal declaration of war.  So to my mind, Hicks was still completely legal.So why was he tortured and allowed to rot in Gitmo for doing something completely legal?And don't try to tell me he was a 'terrorist'!  He was a truck driver in the Regular Army of a recognised government!  The re-writing of history came later!
Alert moderator
21 Mar 2014 7:49:52pmThe Taliban were not the recognised government so that argument is specious.  But even in the Taliban days, Afghanistan did have an army, and so far as I know, Hicks was never part of it.I think, if you consider the Geneva Conventions, you will find that Hicks was never protected by Geneva 3, which covers uniformed soldiers and certain resistance movements which abide by the rules of war.That doesn't make him a war criminal, but it does mean he was not covered by the protections given to prisoners of war.

I don't see how it is in the national interest for an Australian citizen to go to North Korea and blow up a statue of Kim Il-Sung or Kim Jong-Il. What if they were caught? It would create an international incident. Even if they weren't, North Korea would react in outrage, sparking a regional crisis.Australia has relations with states, not movements. There could be certain instances where rebel actions taken by an Australian nmational may be overlooked, but as Stephen points out, since prosecution is at the discretion of the Attorney General, this is already covered.

As a matter of simple fact the above statement, which the author of the article uses to establish a key limb of his "thesis", is just plain WRONG.

21 Mar 2014 4:39:40pmI come late to this discussion, but I am interested in untangling the gaming of the protagonist.   When I studied politics, the standard definition of the Nation State (a somewhat modern invention in historical terms) was 'geographical hegemony and monopoly of violence' and this gives you some idea of the sort of system it is and what citizenship means, as distinct from other systems which exist alongside us on this globe.   It governs, as has been said, who can kill, and under what circumstances.   It also maintains borders inside which its laws are legal, and outside which its citizens come under different jurisdictions.   Ithas proven to be a powerful, rational and potentially wealthy system where it is combined with democracy, uncorrupted legaland civil systems of government, and economic freedom.   When migrants enter this system and obtain citizenship, they are subject to the rule of law of their new Nation State.   They are not free to act outside the rule of its law, especially in military matters overseas, nor to expect refuge back home from the consequences of actions deemed illegal abroad.   All modern nation states share these principles, and offer in return freedomfrom abuse of privilege by others.   In other words, a CONTRACT.It's never quite so neat, but it is both an underlying and overarching principle and some claim it is a moral economy in fact.

21 Mar 2014 4:54:23pmIn the year of the anniversary of the beginning of the madness of the 20th century, I'm amazed that human beings are simultaneously so intelligent as so create the marvels of technology that become everyday almost as soon as they are invented, and also so stupid as to believe that warfare solves anything.If you google the estimates of numbers of people killed during the 20th century it is hard to find anything more that guesstimates, however the numbers would be hundreds of millions and that does not take into account the sheer misery and damage caused.It is tempting to think of war being justified because of bad things that happen or our belief systems, however we collectively were given a great lesson during the cold war.The hawks and so-called experts on both sides were itching to go to war to defeat the baddies on the other side. It was only MAD (mutually assured destruction) that prevented that from happening. Eventually the Soviet Union collapsed from it's own internal contradictions. That that happened should cause us all to eschew resort to war. NOT GOING TO WAR proved to be better than going to war.Of course bad things still happen throughout the world and it's tempting to think we should intervene to right the wrongs, but that ignores the issues that we know all too well through experience, that going to war results in more misery than that which we are trying to fix.I know that the League of Nations did not prevent the second world war and that the United Nations is not much better at achieving justice in the world.There are lots of indications in this age of globalisation, that the powers of the nation state are diminishing, and we are a long way away from achieving any sort of world government, indeed that is seen by many people as undesirable anyway. In the absence of such an overriding body our humanity is unable to even agree on desirable ways to fix world problems. Nevertheless going to war as a solution to problems needs to be resisted every time it is considered as a solution to a particular problem. It is MADNESS.
