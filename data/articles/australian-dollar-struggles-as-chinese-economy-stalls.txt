The Australian dollar has spent most of the day south of the US 70 cent mark and investors are wondering how low it will fall, with the Chinese economy slowing down and the US Federal Reserve still toying with raising rates.The ANZ has been reading the runes like everyone else and is now predicting the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut the cash rate to 1.5 per cent next year.The bank said global growth was slower than it thought, and there would likely be a sharply lower dollar in 2016 with two rate cuts expected in February and May.On the local market, it was a slow climb to regain yesterday's losses, which eventually did not happen.The All Ordinaries gained 69 points to close at 5,102 and the benchmark ASX 200 index, which laboured below 5,000 yesterday, is now back to 5,071.The big banks were all up by about 1.3 per cent, while resources had a mixed session.The energy sector did well, with Woodside lifting 70 cents to $29.50, while Oil Search gained 13 cents to $7.85.Healthcare stocks lifted, Cochlear put on nearly $3.50 to $85.28.Ramsay gained 75 cents to $61.6 and Ansell rose 53 cents to $19.96.But the retail sector was the strongest performer with Woolworths gaining 38 cents to $24.76, Wesfarmers up nearly a dollar at $39.14 and JB Hifi up 68 cents to $19.50.On commodity markets, West Texas crude oil fell to $US44.48 a barrel and iron ore was flat, just below $US57 a tonne.
