New South Wales Premier Mike Baird has suggested that Labor's promise not to sell off the state's electricity network, should it win this month's election, cannot be trusted.He made the comments as he and Labor leader Luke Foley made pitches to Chinese Australian voters at a dinner hosted by the Chinese Australia Forum in Sydney. Mr Baird was asked by the event's moderator to highlight promises that his opponents had broken when they were in government.He nominated Labor's 2007 election promise that it would not sell off electricity assets."What drives me a bit insane on this [electricity] debate is that Labor for the 2007 election told absolutely everyone that they were not going to sell any electricity assets," he said."That's what they said - they wrote letters and that's what their promise was."For the next four years, they did exactly the opposite."They sold the retail businesses, they sold the generator business, they sold lotteries and other things. They say one thing in Opposition but do another thing in government."Mr Baird said, in contrast, he felt he his Government was being honest and upfront about its electricity privatisation plans.Meanwhile Mr Foley said the current Government's biggest broken promise was the cuts it had made to health and education."We've seen large cuts to health and education over the last four years from this Government," he said."When you combine that with the swinging cuts from Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey, we're seeing our public health and public education sectors suffering as a result."Mr Foley also joked that he would like Prime Minister Tony Abbott to join him on the campaign trail."I might invite Tony Abbott," he quipped."I'd like to have him here."I'd like to have a discussion about his $25 billion of cuts to the NSW Health and Education system." Votes from the Chinese community proved crucial in several key seats in the 2011 state election, with voters in seats like Strathfield and Rockdale, switching their allegiance from Labor to Liberal.Mr Baird said the Chinese community understood the value of hard work and he hoped it would recognise the hard work he had done to turn the state's economy around.Mr Foley, meanwhile, concentrated on his health and education promises and said he thought the issues that mattered to the Chinese Australian community were the same issues that mattered to everyone.
