The historical significance of Kristallnacht cannot be doubted. It marked the escalation of Nazi hatred of Jews into systematic violence. It also serves as a powerful cautionary tale as we debate the racial vilification provisions in the Race Discrimination Act, writes Tim Soutphommasane.A few weeks ago I had the honour to meet Gerty Jellinek. Gerty is one of the volunteer guides at the Sydney Jewish Museum. Every Friday, Gerty tells visitors her story of survival. Now in her eighties, Gerty grew up in Vienna. She told me that for a number of years a man had boarded with her family in their home. On 13 March 1938, when Nazi Germany annexed Austria, the boarder appeared in the corridor dressed in brown-shirted, storm trooper uniform. During the years he had lived in Gerty's family home, the boarder had been a member of the SA (Sturmabteilung, or "assault division").It was only a few months later that Kristallnacht took place. We all know what began that night of November 9. Across Germany and Austria, Jews became the targets of an orgy of violence. Families were attacked in their homes. Hundreds of synagogues were destroyed. Thousands of businesses were looted. Cemeteries were desecrated. Beginning on that night, thousands of Jewish men would be arrested and transferred to concentration camps.What happened 75 years ago was fateful - the shattered glass across central Europe represented not just the destruction of Jewish life, but also the shattering of civilized society. One British correspondent in Berlin, Hugh Greene (who would later become Director-General of the BBC), observed the events with nauseous disbelief. As Greene put it,Racial hatred and hysteria seemed to have taken complete hold of otherwise decent people. I saw fashionably dressed women clapping their hands and screaming with glee, while respectable middle-class mothers held up their babies to see the "fun".These were the scenes that a twelve-year-old Gerty saw in Vienna, where the pogrom against Jews was complete. Nearly all of Vienna's 94 synagogues and prayer houses were destroyed. As Gerty recalled to me, Jewish women in Vienna were made to scrub the pavements on the city's streets - a ritual of torment and humiliation.There are some things that require us to care and to remember. Members of a civilized society should not ignore crimes against humanity. They certainly should not revel in the lamentations of other human beings.Shared memory can have a universal ring, too. Earlier this year, the Berliner Philharmoniker gave its first performance of A Child of Our Time, an oratorio by Michael Tippett. The composition of A Child of Our Time began in 1939. Tippett, an English composer and a committed pacifist, was deeply shaken by the violence against Jews on Kristallnacht and the trial of Herschel Grynspan - whose shooting of German diplomat Ernst von Rath was used by Nazis as a pretext for the pogrom.The oratorio has been described as "something Handel might have written had he lived in the age of Auschwitz". Its themes closely track what happened on Kristallnacht, and the role of Grynspan in its eruption. Tippett's piece tells the story of a "general state of oppression in our time" and a "young man's attempt to seek justice [with] catastrophic consequences". Reflecting later on his oratorio, Tippett would write that "the growing violence springing out of divisions of nation, race, religion, status, colour, or even just rich and poor is possibly the deepest present threat to the social fabric of all human society". For Tippett, there was clearly a universal import to the Night of Broken Glass. Kristallnacht illustrated the power of words in the mounting anti-Semitism of the time.The historical significance of Kristallnacht cannot be doubted. It marked the escalation of Nazi hatred of Jews into systematic violence. It illustrated the power of words in the mounting anti-Semitism of the time. It demonstrated what can happen when authorities give people permission to conduct violence. It was the opening act of the Holocaust.The chronology of events shows that Kristallnacht occurred after Grynspan's shooting of von Rath in Paris. Nazi Germany would use it as an excuse to call for demonstrations against Jews in retribution. Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels declared that "insofar as they erupt spontaneously", such demonstrations "are not to be hampered".What resulted was orchestrated violence across Germany and Austria.Such a pattern of authorisation would be repeated in other episodes of genocide during the twentieth century.In Cambodia, it was Pol Pot's call for class hatred against educated officials, businessmen, teachers and city-dwellers that preceded the murder of 25 per cent of the Cambodian national population.In Rwanda, the butchering of 800,000 people began when a radio station incited Hutus to wage a final war of extermination against the Tutsi. Genocide doesn't begin with violence - it indeed begins with words.And it also begins with indifference. What was perhaps most consequential with Kristallnacht was that it was met with such little opposition, both inside Germany and Austria, and from outside. The event confirmed that passivity emboldens the perpetrators of evil: it gives licence to hate; it desensitizes people to the further degradation of others.This needn't mean that indifference transforms otherwise upright or good people into menacing agents of evil. Over the decades, prompted by the arguments of Hannah Arendt, we have come to accept that evil may assume much more banal forms. As Arendt reminds us, "The sad truth is that most evil is done by people who never made their minds up to be or do evil at all." When it comes to the worst of crimes against humanity, the problem is that normal people commit them.We can take from all of this the following. Context and circumstance matter. Moral judgements seldom appear in absolute form. And none of us is ever exempt from human deficiency.The evidence supports this. Experiments in social psychology reveal how small changes in situational context can affect our moral responses.In one famous experiment, the psychologist Philip Zimbardo took a group of healthy young men to a makeshift prison in the basement of a university laboratory. He assigned one half to act as prisoners and the other half to act as guards. Zimbardo appointed himself prison superintendent. He gave the guards instructions that they should refrain from physical torture.Within two days, the student guards had set about inflicting upon prisoners punishments: verbal abuse, sleep deprivation, hours spent in stress positions. Prisoners were forced to repeat physical and mental exercises. Within even this controlled, benign prison environment, the guards grew sadistic. Some prisoners broke into hysteria; others broke into hives. A cycle of degradation had been unleashed.Here is Zimbardo's conclusion:Any deed that any human being has ever committed, however horrible, is possible for any of us - under the right or wrong situational circumstances. That knowledge does not excuse evil; rather, it democratises it, sharing its blame among ordinary actors rather than declaring it the province only of deviants and despots - of Them but not Us.It is a dangerous thing, then, to throw around the language of evil. To call someone evil, after all, is to cast a judgment upon someone's soul. But calling someone's actions evil is another thing. This may be one way to avoid moral laziness: focus on the action rather than the agent.Such matters bear upon the question of race in contemporary Australia. We see regularly from our public debates that levelling the charge of racism isn't to be done lightly. Frequently, those who are alleged to have said or done something will respond - or someone will respond on their behalf - with indignation. To be called racist, they will say, involves a condemnation of moral character that goes well beyond censuring any ignorance.In my view, it is important that we not be sheepish about condemning bad behaviour when we see it. Something needn't be violent or maliciously directed in order to count as racism. Racism, as we know, begins with words. And it needn't be about a doctrinal belief in racial superiority. More often than not, it is about the prejudice born of ethnic stereotypes.But while acts of racism may sometimes be unintentional, they always have consequences. Racism is as much about impact as it is about intention; it is about the impact of actions on the standing that someone enjoys as a member of society.In Australia, it is the federal Racial Discrimination Act, which writes into our laws that everyone can participate in the life of the nation as an equal. But the Act is more than just an instrument for guaranteeing equal opportunity. It is also a statement about racial tolerance in a multicultural society - that we regard civility as a cardinal value, and social cohesion as an absolute necessity.Where people have fallen foul of section 18C in the courts, it has involved racial vilification of a standard that goes well beyond trivial name-calling. Since 1995, the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act have included protections against racial vilification, through sections 18C and 18D. Section 18C makes it unlawful for someone to do an act that is reasonably likely "to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate" someone on the grounds of their race or ethnicity. Reflecting the fundamental importance of freedom of speech, section 18D ensures that artistic works, scientific debate, and fair comment on a matter of public interest are exempt from being in breach of the Act - provided that something is said or done reasonably and in good faith.As many of you know, the federal government has said that it wishes to change the racial vilification provisions of the Act. Namely, it wishes that the Act no longer makes it unlawful to offend or insult someone on the grounds of race.There will be debate about this issue in the coming months. That is how it should be. As citizens in a liberal democracy, we should be able to conduct robust discussions and arguments. If there are to be limits on what we can say, they should have good justifications.But free speech has never been an absolute value. In practice, free speech has never been entirely unrestricted. We have many laws that limit our freedom of speech: for example, laws concerning defamation, laws concerning advertising, laws concerning obscenity, laws concerning fraud, laws concerning public order, laws concerning national security.We should ask a number of questions. Would a change to the law leave people with adequate protections against racial vilification? Would a change have the effect of encouraging people to think that they can harass and vilify others on the grounds of race with impunity? What would be the overall impact on our human rights and freedoms?Any debate should also pay attention to the manner in which the current racial vilification provisions actually operate. Often it is forgotten that section 18D explicitly protects the fundamental value of free speech. Often it is thought that the operation of section 18C serves only to protect hurt feelings and personal sensitivities.Yet the courts have interpreted the law during the past two decades in a consistent manner. Section 18C consists of an objective test: unlawful acts are those that are proven reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to cause harm. It doesn't apply to "mere slights” but only to acts that involve "profound and serious effects”. Where people have fallen foul of section 18C in the courts, it has involved racial vilification of a standard that goes well beyond trivial name-calling.Certainly, in the complaints that reach the Australian Human Rights Commission, it is clear that the current legislation provides redress to people who have been subjected to withering and degrading racial abuse. In what follows, I should warn you that I will be using actual language used in our complaints that may offend.In recent times, the Commission has conciliated a complaint made about a police officer who was alleged to have called Aboriginal bus passengers "you f***ing hairy monkeys". Another complaint involved a website inciting people to yell at Asians, "You Gook F**k Off to China", and encouraging people "to express their anger physically by laying the Gooks out”. Another case involved a man of Jewish ethnic origin putting forward a complaint about a video sharing site on the internet: the website included content in the form of people offering money to kill Jewish people.These are just some examples of the ugliness that the law in practice serves to combat. Indeed, the Racial Discrimination Act provides important protections against racial hatred. The apparent anti-Semitic attack in Bondi just over two weeks ago provides a sad reminder of why sections 18C and 18D were introduced to the Act during the 1990s. As many of you know, there was determination at the time that stopping racial violence required legislative action against racial vilification - it required action aimed at the roots of racial violence.As we commemorate 75 years after Kristallnacht, we naturally reflect on what it may tell us today. For members of Sydney's Jewish community, as for members of Jewish communities everywhere, the Night of Broken Glass is an episode of common and shared memory. It is part of the story of what is your community of memory.It is also important, I believe, that Kristallnacht be the subject of shared memory for all of us. The reason is simple: a crime against humanity anywhere is a crime against humanity everywhere. And the lessons of Kristallnacht are profound and universal. Let us never be complacent about human frailty. Let us never underestimate our capacity to do evil. Let us never licence hatred, for we can never know its bounds.This is an edited version of a speech delivered on the on the 75th anniversary commemoration of Kristallnacht at the Great Synagogue, Sydney, November 10, 2013.Dr Tim Soutphommasane is the federal Race Discrimination Commissioner.

Comments for this story are closed.11 Nov 2013 3:24:59pmThe Abbott Governments plans to immediately set about rescinding Section 18c of The RDA requires much serious examination from The Opposition, other MP's and the press gallery. Introduced in 1995 by Sen.Bolkus this provision has stood the test of time through Keating, Howard,Rudd and Gillard Governments. What could possibly make this a priority for the new Government. Were other parties involved in The Coalition coming to this decision? The perception of the process in reaching this decision should on its own be enough to alarm a great many Australians.

At the moment it's a free-for-all with anyone able to claim they were offended by some remark.We're much better off sticking with the various laws on defamation, fraud and other clearly defined issues.  This does of course leave us with the matter of some people being offended by the truth, in which case I say "Tough!"

12 Nov 2013 8:59:26amDid you read the article? If you want to offend someone 'on the basis of their race', then you are racist. There is no real way around it. If they in reasonable take offence, you have not broken the law. Explain to us the circumstances in which you need say something which offends people, on the basis of their race or ethnic origin. FYI, just saying' the Israeli government is evil for occupying Palestine'  or ' The Palestinian government is evil for not stopping rockets being launched at civilians' are neither racist nor foul of the law. As far as I can see, it is only bigots that need to say things contrary to the law. Show me otherwise.

12 Nov 2013 12:55:46pmBen,"you are no longer allowed to offend someone on the basis of their race"So? Do you wish to offend someone on the basis of their race? And what makes you think that you should be allowed to in the first place?We have three fundamental and inalienable rights: the right to life, the right to liberty and the right to pursue happiness. There is no fundamental "right to insult", and before you go spouting off about the "freedom of speech", stop for a minute to consider the RESPONSIBILITIES that accompany the exercise of such a right.The right to liberty is NOT the same thing as the right to do precisely as you please without regards for your responsibilities as a citizen. So it follows that the right to free speech (which is a derivative of the right to liberty) is also balanced by responsibilities.Unfortunately there are many in our community (surprisingly highly represented among radio shock-jocks) whose short attention span allowed them to learn only of their rights, without picking up anything about their responsibilities. In such circumstances, any responsible society would seek to compensate for this deficiency in certain individuals by imposing legal sanctions on their more anti-social behaviour.Of course, if you would prefer to return to an earlier, less civilised social configuration, you would probably have the "right" to insult someone on the basis of their race restored. The only problem is that your intended victims would also probably have had their right to shoot dead anyone who insults them restored as well.If you want the protection of civilsied society, you have to obey its rules - it is as simple as that.

11 Nov 2013 3:31:11pmWouldn't the new Government want to make changes to this Act to please people like Andrew Bolt, one of its most ardent supporters, who was charged under this Act.  The Government owes a lot to Andrew Bolt and his relentless biased support for Tony Abbott.  Perhaps now the Government is returning the favour and giving Andrew Bolt what he wants, the right to demonise yet more people, in an even more brutal manner.This Government is a disgrace and a disaster!

11 Nov 2013 5:07:08pmWhatever you think of Bolt this law was clearly abused in the Bolt case. The judge ruled that Bolt got certain facts wrong about certain individuals, which would already be covered by defamation law.

11 Nov 2013 5:41:39pm"which would already be covered by defamation law"So what?  That doesn't mean it was abused - it just means that the plaintiffs had options.  You think they should have sued for defamation, apparently they thought otherwise.  The law was applied fairly, to somebody who really should have known better.
Alert moderator
11 Nov 2013 6:23:46pmIt was indeed abused. The Hate law applies the burden of proof to the defendant, unlike any other law, and the offended in that case chose to pursue Bolt through the Racial Hate law rather than defamation for that likely reason - even though they could've sued him for defamation on the grounds that he made defamatory statements about them. But that would've meant the burden of proof would be on them, not Bolt.

12 Nov 2013 4:09:06amTo some people with a certain political bent, Bolt, the Coalition and the IPA, they seem to forget Andrew Bolt didn't just write an article that was factually wrong about a few individuals: he wrote it on the basis of their racial characteristics to try and illustrate that these individuals achieved their place in society because of this, and that this was evident in society generally. That's wrong, and its racism!Whatever anyone thinks about a whole host of issues on this topic, Bolt made assumptions and fabricated the piece as he went along with deliberate or a serious recklessness towards racism. One of the people targeted in his piece was judged to not be dark enough to pass as Indigenous, based only on a picture Bolt was able to find through Google of her mother!Under 18c and anyone with a brain, that's clearly wrong and the law was applied correctly. This wasn't 'abused' at all in this case, and it isn't a bad law. I for one don't want to see this stopped, particularly by a government that claims to be a champion for Indigenous people. Its a sick joke.

11 Nov 2013 5:50:33pmI would like to challenge those 'facts' in public discourse.Its Kafkaesque. To challenge the identity of those persons in a common sense way is seen as evidence of your guilt. There is no way to legally approach a certain important subject of public interest in 21st century Australia because one group is particularly immune from being offended. This is not a slippery slope; we have already arrived at a moral and intellectual dead end of stupidity, authoritarianism, and reinvention of reality. I say two plus two still equals four.

11 Nov 2013 6:56:01pmBolts "challenge" was not based on evidence antipostmodernism, he sought to denigrate and believed he had a "free speech" right to so.  Had his comments been factual the outcome would have been different.Your right to free speech ends when it casts unfounded aspersions on my character that are based on my membership of a group.  In this case my race and ethnicity.Of course if I had some relationship with a bikie gang, however innocent, and lived in Queensland it would be okay.

I am at a disadvantage that I am not allowed to discuss this with you or provide evidence. That alone should be reason to review the laws. Look through the comments and you will notice that there is a constant claim that Bolt was factually incorrect, but no opposing arguments. Read between the lines.

11 Nov 2013 9:07:52pmMycalI am replying here as the other thread seems to have closed off. Your assertion that the test is a reasonable person is wrong. Just wrong. It's whether a person of the same class would be offended. 'Has your concept of "free speech" become so corrupted and so base that it permits the vilest of conduct?'I would suggest that your concept of 'free speech', where speech actually isn't free, is the corruption. Mine is the purest form of free speech - where everyone can say what they want.
Alert moderator
12 Nov 2013 11:28:47amSurely free speech has limits?  Freedom ends where your freedom restricts mine. In this case speech is free so far as it does not intrude upon others' freedoms. People who put their opinion (sometimes without checking their facts) out there as gospel have a responsibility to do there homework and it they don't and their statements encourage hatred (or even revenge) of a particular group of people, then it behoves a society that calls itself civilised to have sanctions against untrammelled opinions, especially when they masquerade as factual.
Alert moderator
12 Nov 2013 12:40:41pmBen, there is no such thing (and there never was such a thing) as absolute free speech, and the only time you may say what you want (without engendering consequence) is when you are talking to yourself.  I have no problem with banning hatespeech, any more than I do with the old saw about shouting fire in a theatre.  As for the test, one assumes that the "person of the same class" is reasonable?  You may consider this an assault on the freedome of speech, but there is a sound argument (rational, philosophical, ethical) that to comprehend the value of a "freedom" requires consideration from the perspective of those who suffer its consequences.  In this case your freedom to be abusive exists only as a let (permission) from the abused and it is clearly not given.  You might want to consider the applicability of this principle in other contexts (eg. evaluating the US freedom to bear arms from the perspective of the people who have been shot).As for my concept of free speech, it applies to the realm of ideas.  If you can give me one example of an "idea" that cannot be expressed in any other than abusive, vile and hateful language I will admit my error and stand on the barricades with you.

11 Nov 2013 9:58:03pm"To challenge the identity of those persons in a common sense way is seen as evidence of your guilt"You really need to eradicate your use of the term 'common sense', which you often apply to those of your opinions that are neither common nor make sense. Identity is a nebulous term and has little to do with skin colour or even genetic ancestry. Is it right for a 3rd generation Chinese Australian to identify herself as Australian? Is Obama an American or condemned in your mind by his skin colour to be forever an alien African abroad?Maybe we need a better definition of 'identity' that is clear to us all and makes sense in cases like these - but picking one person and vilifying her based on some superficial 'common sense' criteria was simply an act of malevolence and qualifies clearly as motivated by hate.
Alert moderator
12 Nov 2013 9:41:34amNo.  I disagree.  There is a distinction between saying something offensive and being malevolent.  Bolt's article was offensive all right, but I don't think it reached the level of intimidation or incitement to hatred that you're implying.

12 Nov 2013 8:52:25amLet's accept that the court got it wrong in the eyes of some. However courts have also convicted people innocent of murder.

As the article argues so well to change a law based on the feelings of grievance of a person convicted, iust because they are a friend of the Government, would be far worse.

11 Nov 2013 3:43:52pmNicely written piece. It does, however, skirt around why section 18C is likely to be removed - the Andrew Bolt case. He may have made factual errors, but the impression is left with many that he was prosecuted and convicted for daring to question the aboriginality of a person whose skin colour might have led many to wonder if they were aboriginal.It very much feels like it was at the "hurt feelings" level that should be below the level that would invoke prosecution.Could not defamation laws adequately deal with people who abuse or otherwise vilify others (then again, who would be the litigant if general abuse was put up online against a group?)?
Alert moderator
11 Nov 2013 5:21:57pmAndy, Bolt would not have been found to have been in breach of the law had he not depended so wholly on "significant distortion of facts" to attack the complainants. If Bolt had stuck to well-researched facts, the piece which was found in breach of the law would have been protected by 18D, which, as pointed out above, is a provision designed to protect "the fundamental value of free speech".
Alert moderator
11 Nov 2013 6:33:15pmMark,Bolt offered an opinion - and I can assure you that when the law is repealed many more comments on this case will be made. But until then free speech has been halted by the dags of the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd government's attack on the rights of journalists to make fair comment.

11 Nov 2013 9:33:20pmRusty, as Tim said, "free speech has never been entirely unrestricted". Try offering an opinion that defames a person or a corporation and you'll see how it works.  Bolt based his attack on the complainants on "significant distortions of fact", and that's why he failed to satisfy 18D (the free-speech provision). Also, I'm not sure what Rudd & Gillard had to do with the Bolt v Eatock case. They didn't introduce the law, and had not part in enforcing it.

11 Nov 2013 9:44:34pmBolt is allowed to be wrong all the time, Ben. However, as Tim stated, "free speech has never been entirely unrestricted". There are laws concerning defamation, advertising, obscenity, fraud, public order and national security.If Bolt was sued for defamation, for instance, Bolt could use the defence that the "defamatory statement is substantially true."That's how the law works. Tell the truth and you're not in breach.

12 Nov 2013 2:17:48pmBen,"People should be allowed to be wrong."Engineers aren't. Doctors aren't. If an engineer fails to do his job and builds a bridge that falls down with a whole heap of people on it, he or she would rightly be in big trouble. If it turns out that their poor design was the result of an intention to cause harm, the penalties would be even greater. But the point is that, even if the engineer has made a genuine mistake, they are still judged to be at fault - and this is exactly as it should be.As citizens we all have a right to freely express our HONESTLY HELD OPINIONS, provided that we take reasonable steps to ensure that our statements are true, and that we can establish that some public interest has been served by making them. That is what we call the "right to free speech".As a public figure and commentator on national affairs, Mr Bolt is under an even heavier obligation in this respect.Mr Bolt made comments that had the potential to cause significant damage to the reputations of several prominent Australian citizens. But more serious, his comments had the potential to increase racial tension and hence do serious damage to our social fabric. Like an engineer who fails to adequately assess the integrity of his designs, Mr Bolt failed to exercise due diligence in ensuring that his comments were true and that the public interest was served by the comments being published.Mr Bolt was wrong. Nobody doubts that. His offence was not so much in being wrong, but in failing to honour his duty to exercise due diligence before opening his mouth.

If one iota of what Bolt had to say was right (and some of it arguably was) then he should have had the right to say it;  even if it was all wrong, he should still have the right to say it, and be disproved.  How can you ever test ideas and opinions if not in a verbal free-for-all exchange?

He will write what he is paid to write. For this reason he is an attractive megaphone for any media mogul intent on undermining our civil society for short-term financial gain. His job is to spread distrust, erode our trust in our fellow citizens and, in so doing, "white-ant" our very social fabric. And he does it very well.

If that's an 'opinion' to you then I pause to think of what Kristilnacht is to you too...'People should be allowed to be wrong.'Of course, but they then should apologise when they are called out instead of being brought to court and calling it a battle of free speech. Bolt isn't three years old!'Sorry, but when you have a law that says giving offence is enough to breach it, it is not a law that supports free speech.'Or, you have a law that says if you are going to make up stuff about a group of people in your own time and private space then your free to do so, but don't clog public sources of information as your platform for obvious stupidity.

12 Nov 2013 7:55:35am@MS - there is a difference between hacking phones, which is clearly illegal, and expressing an opinion, however erroneous and wrong-headed.  And why should I or anyone else have to stick to "well researched facts?"  The Drum is replete with inaccuracies and factual errors, not to mention offensive comments.  If every one of them were subject to review, quite a few of them would fail the test you lay out.  How would the Drum, or indeed discussion, be the better for it?  To quote JS Mill:  " the peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is, that it is robbing the human race; posterity as well as the existing generation; those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it. If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error."Yes, this law does stifle free speech.  If Bolt is wrong, then argue against him.  Do not demand that he be silenced, as he was, by officialdom.

12 Nov 2013 11:19:48amNice work with the Mill quote.Nevertheless, pro-Nazi speech acts are illegal in Germany for a reason. You speak from the comfort of a relativity pluralistic and vaguely tolerant society. But that can change, and hateful media demagogues can really help with the process.It's a mistake to work in ideological absolutes.I'm really not sure why the plaintiffs didn't just sue for defamation. Or if these laws, on the balance, support or detract from the propogation of factual narratives as opposed to falsehoods.But it's likewise not so simple to just conflate the rights of your average Joe on the street, with a man of Boltie's power.

12 Nov 2013 9:21:04amIt is when the offence is based on race. There are no fair, racist comments. You do not have the freedom to say anything at all which is not true and which has no purpose but to inflame racism. This is the Bolt situation.

12 Nov 2013 10:03:35am@Greyarea - I think an argument can be made for restricting speech which incites hatred or inflames hatred.   But that's not what this is about.  This is about speech which offends people.  And that is too low a bar to set for something as important as free speech.

11 Nov 2013 3:48:02pmTo compare a provision in an act that makes it unlawful to 'offend' someone (when the test is not a reasonable person but rather that particular class of people) with the Nazis is ludicrous and, quite frankly despicable. The fact that the left is ok with it being against the law to offend someone shows how far removed they have become from their original libertarian roots. The advancement of a society requires challenging, dangerous, and yes, sometimes offensive ideas. I understand why you would like to keep the provisions (your job, after all, depends on the state restricting the speech and acts of individuals), but for the rest of us who enjoy our freedom it is a horrible provision that should be removed.

Dangerous, challenging and even offensive ideas might be good, but they aren't if the are incorrectly applied to individuals who are named and shamed.

11 Nov 2013 6:59:56pmNowhere did I say that there was an Act against this.  I simply used it to try to get you to understand that I and others may hold very different ideas from yours and you shouldn't make the assumption that because your notions are legal under the present legal system that others might not hold ideas which may be just as valid as yours and perhaps more valid but that there are sanctions against them acting on them.It continues to confuse me that just a few centuries ago the thing which you use as an arbiter of morals and ethics was "swimming" women and hanging them for having been "proved" to have had sex with the devil, and yet many lawyers cling to the same structure, the legal system, as the only arbiter of all morals and ethics.Mr Howard used regularly make exactly the same mistake - he kept talking about "our" shared values.  I share extremely little with Mr Howard.  I probably share just as little with you, but whereas you can demand the freedom to think as you do and act accordingly, I do not have that freedom.I have no doubt that you think that law and morality are directly related.

We could call out stealing for being unjust, but I very much doubt that that would stop it.As a society we have become totally "hung up" about our freedoms.....we have become so egocentric and self-centred that we believe that there should be very few restrictions on what we do or say.  Your freedoms, however, very quickly impinge on my freedoms.......in other words, where we live together we need to have limits in order to live harmoniously and in ways in which people are not victimized by others.

11 Nov 2013 6:42:34pmI agree that offence in itself is a poor test, one can choose to be offended by anything including anothers mere existance BUT there is a difference between the simply offencive and language designed to dehumanise a person. Such language is alway a prelude for violence before acts of commission or ommision.Just look at the way some people in Australia who should know better descibe assylum seekers as "queue jumpers" despite there being no queues available to them and "illegals" despite them being entitled to seek assylum under international law to which Australia is a signatory.Putting people on remote islands in inhumane conditions and isolation it itself are forms of deep violence to they psyche if not the body and we are a part of that unless we speak up about it.
Alert moderator
11 Nov 2013 7:16:28pmBen you really have to change your handle or seriously consider actually getting a degree in the law.  The test is whether a reasonable person would conclude the remarks were unfounded and offensive to a class of people.  Nor is the comparison to the Nazi's without justification, first they vilified and dehumanised the Jews then they killed them, the rest is history.There is no "loss of freedom" here, other than a loss of the right to vilify another person on racial, ethnic or cultural grounds.  Nor is it a constraint on the expression of ideas (good bad or indifferent) and I fail to see how any "idea" can be expressed in the abuse of another individual.To accuse the "left" of being okay with this puzzles me.  The left is probably okay with it but my question to you is how can you not be?  Has your concept of "free speech" become so corrupted and so base that it permits the vilest of conduct?  (Rhetorical question, the Murdoch press already tells me the answer).

11 Nov 2013 3:54:30pmOn the surface, this is a reasonable article (who could disagree that racial vilification is a bad thing?) but the issue of freedom of speech and its erosion is more complicated than the article makes out.  For example, I may not agree with someone's cultural or religious norms or values (which none of us are born with, and which should always be open to honest intellectual challenge and debate) but yet presently I may quickly be labelled as "racist" if I merely offend someone by saying so.  This article doesn't have a nuanced enough approach to freedom of speech and why it is important.

11 Nov 2013 5:30:46pmWhile such labelling of you may be accurate (under given circumstances) you need not fear any court appearances unless your words or actions cause serious harm to somebody else.Calling you "racist" (or you me, for that matter) doesn't qualify.

11 Nov 2013 5:59:10pmYou will never be labeled for complaining about bad behaviour or criminality in other groups in society as long as you direct your comments towards the individuals concerned and  don't generalize in racial terms. If you witness a crime, it would be unusual to cop a label for accurately identifying an offender by race.  The trouble really comes when you falsely assign or imply criminality based on your political ideology. This was done to the Jews in Nazi Germany, and some people in Australia these days  are not beyond doing that to people they have become phobic or jealous about.

11 Nov 2013 4:00:37pmThanks to Tim for an interesting and moving piece.I probably give the fundamental freedoms a little more weight than he does, principally because they are under regular wear and tear by attrition. At some point the total weight of moderate and reasonable limitations, regularly added to, can render them no longer free. However my concerns are less for the freedom to insult others because of their race than for us to be able to criticise and hopefully reform the power centres in society. To my mind, that's a quite different type of freedom.I don't support making changes for the convenience of Bolt et al.

11 Nov 2013 4:06:27pmLaws against racist hate speech in Weimar Germany did not prevent the Nazi movement from gaining strength and rising to power. Yes hateful acts are often preceded by hateful speech, but having the latter out in the open tells us who the haters are so such individuals can be monitored - otherwise they hide in the shadows. Sunlight is the best disinfectant. Besides, we already have defamation laws to handle situations such as the Bolt case where Bolt made erroneous assertions about certain individuals.

12 Nov 2013 8:55:03amThe justification, Jimmy, is as follows:- - we accept that a free press is a necessary functioning component of a liberal democracy- in order for that, the press needs to be truthful when reporting (as distinct from the publication of editorial comment)- the press has been given the privilege of writing its own code of conduct to do those things freely which the press believes are necessary for it to function as a component of a civilised society- certain organs of the press have consistently refused to abide by its own code of conduct which means that they're no longer operating as a part of society, but instead as a destructive and inimical force against a civilised society- laws have been passed which are intended to limit the harm that press actions which do not meet the code of conduct are allowed to harm other people. (That's exactly the same principle under law which prevents (or deters) me from taking a sledgehammer to the windscreen of your car.)- it was proposed by the ALP government that the press should establish and fund a position for some eminent person (probably with legal or publishing experience) to insist that the press abide by its own code of conduct, thereby returning the press to its previous status as a functioning member (or organ) of a civilised society.The press refused.

12 Nov 2013 12:06:58pmA 'free press' is meant to be the embodiment of free speech - commentary that is free from organised interference. However, a free press is not 'free' just because the government doesn't interfere with it - it must be free from any organised interference to be really free. How free is the Murdoch press? How free are we readers with 70% of our press dominated by one voice?Freedom is not so simply defined as being free from legislative interference.

11 Nov 2013 4:19:34pmIt's a fairly simple philosophical argument.Either you trust society to be exposed to racist/nasty views with the view that they will shout them down, or you don't.Either you accept that proscribing an offence whereby the objective element is, inescapably, the feelings of another party, or you believe it's heavy handed and authoritarian.Either you believe that true free speech, not necessarily the Yankee cartoon variety, is essential to truly free society, or you don't.At the very quick of the thing, however, the true test is whether you believe the right of an individual to be protected from subjective emotions of offence ought be enshrined above and beyond the right of another individual to speak freely and without causing quantifiable loss or harm to that person.Most of the examples you give are punishable at law already, the proposed repeals simply reverse the above proposition. To suggest that legality and morality are somehow entwined is a nonsense. It is perfectly legal to cheat on your spouse with their parent or sibling. It does not follow that the law encourages the same.I personally believe that where no loss or harm is caused through demonstrably and deliberately peddling of lies or deciet, or no criminal act has been incited that might reasonably cause harm or loss, then offensive ideas can be assessed and weighed by the community who will respond based upon the standards of that community. kristalnacht is an example, writ large, of the possible excesses of the community however the global reaction is an equally heartening example of the judgement inevitably to be handed down by society at large.

12 Nov 2013 1:54:01pmSince 1995, the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act have included protections against racial vilification, through sections 18C and 18D. Section 18C makes it unlawful for someone to do an act that is reasonably likely "to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate" someone on the grounds of their race or ethnicity. Reflecting the fundamental importance of freedom of speech, section 18D ensures that artistic works, scientific debate, and fair comment on a matter of public interest are exempt from being in breach of the Act - provided that something is said or done reasonably and in good faith".Section 18D clearly takes care of your concerns.  No one is trying to suppress views, opinions and legitimate debate.  The law is to ensure people do not suffer verbal bullying as a means of "outing them" from society.  To change it is to reduce the freedom of individuals to live without being victimized.  One's individual freedom always has to be balanced against the freedoms of other individuals and we need to be very careful about the motives of those who want to change the balance.
Alert moderator
12 Nov 2013 3:09:57pmNo, 18D does not take care of my concerns.  I don't care whether the person doing the offending is doing it in good faith, believing what he say to be true, or if he's doing it mischievously, to generate debate, or even if he's doing it maliciously, to deliberately offend the individual or group.  All I care about it that simply giving offence should not be a bar to free speech, regardless of the speaker's state of mind at the time.There is a gulf between giving offence, and indulging in hate speech.  No one should have to be a target of hate speech, but neither should anyone expect to have a right never to be offended. That is too great an imposition on other people's right of free expression.  The balance in this act is wrong, it's as simple as that.

12 Nov 2013 3:33:53amYou seem to almost be advocating an "it's for our own good" approach here, in that you seem to be saying that as a society, we are now unable to identify and act against racial hatred when we see it. This is not true.The deliberate "every child gets a trophy" and "we don't keep score, because it's not about winning", and the lack of allowable constructive criticism which is prevalent in Australian schools, is a form of repression, courtesy of the "it's for our own good" school of thought. This goes much too far in its attempts to instil that sense of "cooperative collectivity and community" which you desire.

12 Nov 2013 8:59:08am"...we are now unable to identify and act against racial hatred when we see it. "It's not the inability, James Murphy, it's the unwillingness to act against racial hatred.That does need to be corrected. Such actions are not acceptable and if you (collectively) refuse to act against them, as has already been demonstrated, then the law needs to enacted to make it a legal, as well as a social, offence.

12 Nov 2013 10:08:21am@Miowarra - there are plenty of areas for the law to act on racism.  Anti-discrimination laws that protect minorities when it comes to education, access to housing, employment and the like are important parts of the attack on racism.  So are laws which prohibit incitement to violence against racial minorities.The point is that a balance has to be drawn between protection of racial minorities and protection of free speech.  And drawing the line at "offending" a group rather than at "threatening" it is the wrong place to draw it.

11 Nov 2013 4:54:12pmI love that comment that genocide begins with words. Words encapsulate how we think - which is why racial and other discrimination/abuse must be outlawed in any civilised community - that is our clear statement of what we consider to be injurious to our society. It's not about free speech - anyone's "freedom" should end when it restricts someone else's. It always fascinates me that some of the best "haters" proudly call themselves Christians - ironic that one of Jesus's most famous sayings was to "love they neighbour as thyself". Kristallnicht must never be forgotten - as it is a key example of how vilification if unchecked can lead to appalling hatred and worse.

11 Nov 2013 5:41:13pmJenn; To be a christian is not to say to the world that 'I am perfect..I am a better person than you'.

11 Nov 2013 4:56:05pmThe author's reference to Kristallnacht is powerfully emotive.  Violence and loss of freedom can result from words.  So, there is a temptation to suppress words.But suppressing words can also lead to a loss of freedom.  Censorship is a hardship that oppresses many people around the world.  So we should not suppress words eagerly.In the examples the author presents towards the end of the article, it seems clear that direct incitement to violence crosses the threshold.  It is not clear to me, however, that straight up verbal abuse does so.If it were up to me, I would remove the "offend or insult" portion of the Racial Discrimination Act.  I think that is too easy to trigger.  It seems likely that threatening behaviour is already covered by other laws anyway.Why do I think this distinction is important?  Because offense can be irrational and extreme and this in itself should not be tolerated.  Consider the Danish cartoons that upset Islamic fundamentalists.  People who are upset that others do not agree with them should not be able to use laws that seek to prevent actions that "offend or insult".In this small area, I find myself in agreement with our present government.
Alert moderator
11 Nov 2013 7:14:32pmI have to agree. It's well and good to expect and demand people to refrain from directionless villification whether it be of race, religion, lifestyle or whether they like a certain movie or not. On the other hand, we don't cure the problem by silencing it, and we cannot discuss the problem if people are afraid to mention it.I strongly dislike many tactics this government has used, one being to label asylum seekers as "illegal" before their claims have even been investigated, but I do think we can survive the removal of these provisions.
Alert moderator
11 Nov 2013 5:00:33pmI don't think it's the racial vilification law itself that's concerning people.  Most of us are not racists, so the law has no effect on us!It's more that activists and their lawyers can use the law to create stuff that was never the intention of the law when it was passed by the Parliament.  Some people take offence very easily.  Others take a confected sort of offence because it suits their agenda.  Others again don't take serious offence over extreme racist slurs, when they probably should.So, the issue is all about how we determine when offence is legitimately taken.  Is it simply when the person abused is offended (ie entirely subjective) ?  Or, can people who were not the direct target of the abuse take offence vicariously ?  Or should it simply be the so-called "reasonable person" test ?And what is the boundary between "race" and "religion" ?  Is Jewish or Muslim just a religion or is it a race?  In other words, is slagging Judaism or Islam racist?  Slagging Christianity isn't.And what is the boundary between "race" and "tradition" or "culture" ?  Is slagging the Muslim attitudes to gays or women, for example, racist?  Is arguing that the circumcision of baby boys for other than genuinely medical reasons is a barbaric practice and is an assault on a child - is that racist?The racial vilification law that Brandis wants to amend is a great example of the law of unintended consequences.  Which makes it a bad law, even though the motivation for it is good.As we are seeing on the European political stage, racists are coming out of the shadows and becoming kind-of respectable.  For example, Le Pen is far outpolling Hollande at the moment.  There, at least, the problem is one that is well beyond any racial vilification law to fix.We do need to prevent the same thing happening here in Australia, for all our sakes.  But is racial vilification law the right tool?  The evidence is not good.  
Alert moderator
11 Nov 2013 5:02:59pmI think the law is too vague and open to interpratation to be any use. It is symbolic more than anything, which in itself is maybe the point. If I criticise say India's caste system that may well offend someone, but my defence could be it's 'fair comment', which is all very subjective. And if you truly want to make it illegal to "to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate" people, then having all the 'get out' clauses makes it pretty much a toothless tiger. If it's wrong to insult someone how can it be right if you dress it in fancy wrappings of 'art'.I think Bolt should have been done for defamation, and most of the example here are incitement to violence.At the end of the day I don't think this law is workable, or achieves anything. Social convention can be just, if not more, powerful than laws. We should be aiming for a society where these type of laws aren'tnecessary.The crux of the issue is will keeping or ditching these provisions will make any difference in the real world. I doubt it, so it doesn't really matter. I agree that we are all capable of evil, but I doubt this law would have saved the Jews, and I doubt not having it will send us down dark paths. Genocide does begin with words, but if enough people really want to believe those words, and act on these words, a law won't stop them.
Alert moderator
11 Nov 2013 5:53:44pmYes, we should be aiming for a society where these laws are unnecesary which means we have to move towards greater equality, not greater inequality. That is not the case at the moment so we are becoming more vulnerable to extreme behaviours. When we have people like Alan Jones, Andrew Bolt etc getting away with denigrating minorities, there is always the danger that others will feel free to copy them. It is easy for some people to get carried away as we have seen many times in history. Laws at least may inhibit some.

12 Nov 2013 3:29:08pmRex,"but do you really trust a court to judge your action"The simple answer to your question is "we have already made that choice".You see, we have a legal system. It already exists. And it exists and works because we have ALL agreed to be bound by the decisions of our courts. We don't get to pick and choose which particular judgements we accept and which we ignore, and neither should we.We have placed our trust in courts and judges because, if we don't, there is no point in having a legal system in the first place. And our legal system has developed a very effective way of ensuring consistency and reliability in decisions on subject like whether a comment was made honestly and in good faith: it is called "precedent". We now have hundreds of years and millions of individual cases to use as a vast "precedent store" and, armed with this resource, judges are able to make hairline distinctions and demonstrate a remarkable degree of consistency in their judgements.The real question is not whether you trust a court to make that judgement, but rather one of who else would you trust with such a decision. Our courts were set up precisely for that purpose. If we don't trust them, why have them?
Alert moderator
12 Nov 2013 4:15:46pmHi Rex, Thanks for your reply. I've spent a bit of time thinking about your question. I have the feeling this is going to be quite wordy, so please bear with me.As a base point, I think it is definitely possible to tell if someone is acting reasonably and in good faith. For example, when a friend's colleague said "Why are your people such bad drivers? Is it something to do with how you people perceive depth?" Although the question stopped me in my tracks, it was possible to see that she had asked a genuine question in good faith. The mood and tone was quite different compared to, for example, walking down the street and having strangers lean into my face and shout slurs. Besides the obvious differences in aggression/mood/tone, I think the key is a willingness to engage in civil back-and-forth. So going from that base point, the next scary step is your question: would I trust a court to judge my actions? Although I'm fortunate enough to have never gone through the courts myself, I think feeling like a powerless individual at the mercy of an institution would be quite terrible. Nonetheless, we do rely on the courts to distinguish between murder and manslaughter, as an example. If I were to accidentally kill someone, I would definitely hope that they could judge my actions as accidental, although I wouldn't TRUST them to, as you say. So, even though I wouldn't trust a court to judge correctly on my case, I still don't think that murder and manslaughter should be decriminalised because I think it's one of the ways that society tells its citizens that we believe each other's lives are valuable. Similarly I think the RDA, with 18C and 18D, is one of the ways society tells its citizens that we believe racial vilification has no place our society. Obviously the similarities end there because my comparison of murder laws with the RDA is pretty ridiculous really. After all, breaching the first is a crime, while breaching the second is merely unlawful - much more like getting a parking fine. Even in the most famous case of Andrew Bolt, the penalty was even more modest than a parking fine - just an apology and an order against republishing. We aren't talking about new legislation here; we're talking about repealing legislation that has been in effect since 1995, and the penalty for the most famous case was so modest! I had to laugh when I found out, and I wonder if others here know that they don't really have anything to fear. Best wishes,mank.

You can be excused for your error simply because you mistook the inaccurate "common usage" of the term for its specific application (itself an example of another fallacy or rhetorical trick, known as "Equivocation").Question-begging is a rhetorical trick very closely related to another rhetorical trick known as "argument from authority". The basic difference is that saying "God exists because the Bible says he exists" is an "argument from authority", while saying that "The Bible is Gods word because the Bible says it is God's word, which is infallible, so if Gods word says it is God's word, you'd better believe it."What you have quoted is an example of one question PROMPTING another.

We have plenty of home-grown examples of how populist "blood lies" have seriously eroded our soceity and led to outbreaks of mob violence.Take, for example, the Lambing Flat massacre, in which innocent Chinese miners were set upon by their caucasian counterparts and scores were killed. Or the Myall Creek massacre. Both were the results of the same type of hysterical populism that was revived by the Howard government and used with devastating effect against Australians "of Middle Eastern Appearance". And we even have our own "Kristalnacht". It occured in Cronulla, when a bunch of drunken yobbos, inspired by months of government-sanctionend anti-semitic propaganda (yes, arabic speakers are "semites" too), went on a rampage through the streets of Cronulla.I was in Sarajevo a couple of years before the Balkans War. It was a happy, multi-cultural city in which Serbs, Croats, Kosovars, Christan Bosnians and Moslem Bosnians mixed, worked together, and even partied together. So I was horrified and shocked to see how such civilised people could descend into barbarism so quickly under the weight of relentless, populist propaganda.Populists are generally not bright enough to realise that they are playing with fire. They do not understand that the veneer of civilisation is still very thin and fragile. When things go badly wrong, as they did in Germany, Rwanda, and on the streets of Cronulla, the populists inevitably look around for someone to blame. They appear incapable of any form of self-awareness or responsibility. They do not see the link between their actions and their consequences, not because they are blind, but because they REFUSE to see.

Discrimination and vilification on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion etc. must not be tolerated in a truly Democratic society. Like a living organism, Democracy requires a cultural/legal immune system that protects it from the scourge of cultural cancer. A system of social living that is uncivilised and intolerant is ultimately self-destructive. This anti-multicultural, anti-democratic stance of the right-wing of politics, has been evident for some time now, but it has taken truly pathological forms under the leadership (so called) of Tony Abbott. It is time that both (l)iberals and Libertarians raise their voices, so that they can also help stop the fear that some supporters of the Coalition have of "government control" from giving free rein to the abuses of the "weak individual" by the "powerful individual".

'It is time that both (l)iberals and Libertarians raise their voices'Libertarians are raising their voices against government interference in speech. Which is why we are against these sections of the Racial Discrimination Act.

"No it isn't, that's only the talking point that the extremists have chosen to try to take control of the public discussion.It's actually about the courts deciding whether certain utterances cause harm to other people.

11 Nov 2013 6:55:40pmThe problem with Nazi Germany was not that speech was free, but that only permitted speech was free.  Just Like Dr Soutphommasane proposes.Nazis were protected from "vilification" for their deeply held beliefs and ideology.It is unworthy and ridiculous that Dr Soutphommasane characterises the problem with Nazi Germany as excessive free speech. The very opposite is the case.Free speech protects us from the likes of Nazi Germany.  The culture of the liberal democratic world can be freely vilified in any country.  But pernicious ideologies are keen to be protected everywhere.

12 Nov 2013 10:21:00amSome very fair points Ibrahim.So all groups should be allowed to express their hatred of other groups and promote such beliefs?

11 Nov 2013 7:09:35pmThe proposed laws that will restrict freedom of speech if enacted should be done away with ; when someone vilifies verbally another, what is required by the affected is more speech, not less. It should be enough that a wrong to another be made apparent ; no one, really is responsible for another's perceptions and subsequent humiliation, and a retort would be satisfactory.The law, in this instance, is being made to change people's behaviour through its' own humiliations ; it won't work, and such laws may not only outlaw rudeness, but also political motivations.

11 Nov 2013 9:36:11pm"No one;really is responsible for another's perceptions and subsequent humilation".So are you saying that in reality the Nazi propoganda machine was not responsible for the 'perception" which the good people of Germany came to in respect to the Jews?All through history good people have been manipulated to do evil things.It is what causes wars-dissent and disagreements between nations- religions- and cultures.With free speech comes the responsibility to show 'respect".Free speech is not a licence to vilify.Free speech entitles criticism not demonising. Demonising and villification are the tools rabble raisers use.

11 Nov 2013 7:37:17pmI take the view that in its present form paragraph 18c of the racial discrimination act is unsatisfactory.   The Bolt case is a good example.  The complainants were ?no shrinking violets? and in their turn quite capable of offensive speech.On the other hand the extreme of insulting and offensive speech requires some regulation.  My suggestion the question of intent is all important.    If the intent is to hurt and insult an individual or group of individuals, that must be classified as illegal.On the other hand if the intent is to make a reasonable political or philosophical point that must be allowed.    The law as it stands does not require accuracy in the writing of a journalist.  That to me is sensible because journalists and commentators will inevitable make mistakes and as long as these are corrected little harm is done.I do not believe that question of intent should be decided on the basis of the subjective bias of a judge alone. The test is that of a ?hypothetical reasonable man? as determined by a jury.

11 Nov 2013 7:40:48pmThere is still racial discrimination all around the world. From my perspective, it is caused the education. No one is born to respect others, and no one is born to have the discrimination. They have the idea of racial differences by receiving education from parents, teachers, books and media. Therefore, I really believe that government and media can offer great help reducing this kind of discrimination. If people always hear objective comments about the global history and international issues, they will certainly have a objective impression over other nations and learn to be more respectful towards them.  However, what happening now is that government in many countries cannot disinterestedly analyzing international issues which makes its people more difficult to really know what happens and make unbiased judgment.

12 Nov 2013 12:23:52amIt saddens me that events that occurred 75 years ago still happen in Australia today.In the past few years specific chocolate/coffee shops have been targeted by demonstrations from racist totalitarians who's behaviour has ranged from intimidating to violent. The reason why these chocolate/coffee shops were targeted by these mobs of thugs is because of the race of the owner.I can't recall a single instance of chocolate hurting anyone.Cheers

12 Nov 2013 2:51:25amSo the Liberals want to repeal 18C - why?Just as Kristallnacht was a politically motivated event to displace Jews from Germany and force them to hand over their resources to the government to fund the forthcoming war then can we foresee a political motive in the current government. Are we to have official vilification? To what end - simply attracting ignorant rednecks when they see the absolute hollowness of the 'turn back the boats' that conned their votes in the last election.Or is it simply pandering to the ravings of the ultra right wing shock jocks. Or did someone from the Murdoch media simply ask for it ( along with buying the ABC, and crippling broadband to the home?Time will tell - but what ever it is it will not be liberal.

12 Nov 2013 6:19:48amAfter reading this piece Tim it is obvoius to me that the behaviour you seek to expose and control is endemic to human nature.These behaviours seem  to  be a manifestation of revenge for perceived wrong doings which is a natural reaction that is usually repressed in human society.As such it is always going to bubble to the surface with sometimes catastrophic results and the latent power of this phenomena is firmly lodged within all humans.If one carefully reads the many posts here and elsewhere it is easy to see where it starts,it begins with blame and  lack of personal responsibility.

12 Nov 2013 7:30:03amWhat a powerful article. It shows clearly the power of words to hurt and incite violence and hatred. As a physically disabled Australian (a Thalidomide survivor) I know what it is like to be discriminated against and how hurtful words can be. We need to remember the lesson that it is often the most ordinary of people who can commit the most horendous of crimes against other humans.

12 Nov 2013 8:19:04amThe Weimar Republic had many laws against anti-Semitism, and a fat lot of good they did.  The suggestion that Bolt's comments, which were endorsed incidentally by many Aborigines, are the thin edge of the Krystallnacht wedge probably resonates with the febrile imaginations of the politically correct, but mercifully not with the sensible majority.It sounds more like an oily apparatchik, appointed in the dying days of the last government, desperately trying to shore up his cosy position.  He might have to get a real job, poor dear.

12 Nov 2013 9:24:18amHere's another viewpoint:This issue came up when it was proposed to transfer the wording of the RDA into the omnibus Human Rights and Anti Discrimination bill under the Gillard government.  One comment:".. the question is whether it goes too far when it goes to merely offending conduct. My view is that it does. I think that the right to offend is inherent in the right to free speech. That doesn't mean that it's always tasteful or measured, but one can't sit back and judge all exercisers of free speech and make sure they are sufficient for polite conversation - free speech goes beyond polite conversation."James Spigelman, former Chief Justice of NSW and Chairman of the ABC.  There are quite a number of people who are politically progressive or centrist and who have serious issues with the wording of the RDA. Spigelman isn't a right-wing bogan, and neither is Jonathan Holmes.  Both have qualms about the "offense" provision.  It is facile to paint this as simply a fight between ALP and Coalition, progressives and bogans.  There are deeper issues involved.

12 Nov 2013 10:48:40amThis is exactly what Abbott wants, he wants to be able to demonise women, migrants, blacks, asians and anyone who not white and catholic. By demonising them he can blame them for his shortcomings and lack of ability. This government is illegitimate and is taking us towards apartheid south africa. Just watch, it won't be long before aboriginaines are again looked at as second class citizens and women are slowly removed from all jobs excpt cleaning and childcare. this is abbott's underlying plan! We need an election now to get rid of this horrible man. Where is the Governor general or is she part of the plan as well? Has she been 'bought off' with a huge retirement plan or something?

12 Nov 2013 12:50:47pmI've given some further thought to Tim's article.  He makes the point, repeatedly, that words have meaning, that words matter, and indeed he's correct.  But then he himself uses words like "offend" and "harass" and "vilify" as though they were interchangeable. They're not.  Vilifying someone or some group is not the same as offending them, either in commonsense terms or in legal ones.  If the wording of 18C referred to "vilification, humiliation and/or intimidation," we probably wouldn't be having this debate.  But it doesn't. It refers to giving offence.  It sets a standard for the limits of free speech with is far, far too restrictive.  And that's the point of the discussion:  it's not that there should be a free-for-all of racially-based vituperation flying around;  it's that the line for what is and is not subject to restriction has to be drawn in a different place. In Canada, where freedom of expression is protected constitutionally, the courts have nonetheless agreed that limitations can be imposed where hate speech is involved.  The standard there, however, is that speech can only be limited if it exposes a group to "hatred," defined as "extreme manifestations of the emotion described by the words 'detestation' and 'vilification' "  That is a long way from "giving offence."  And to be honest, I am myself quite offended by Tim's attempt to link this debate with Kristallnacht.  He says "[Kristallnacht]  demonstrated what can happen when authorities give people permission to conduct violence."  Yes, it did.  But it is a very long bow indeed to equate removing the term "offend" from the RDA with giving permission for racial violence. I'd go so far as to argue that it is in fact a straw-man fallacy.
Alert moderator
12 Nov 2013 1:10:16pmI think some of the comparisons to Kristallnacht invoke Godwin's law, but support for 18C is well made in the right context. Perhaps my problem then is that it isn't really supplied here.I don't think we do well in proscribing bigotry in ways that dispense with the burden of persuasion to better ways of thinking about diversity within a tolerant and pluralist, dare I say even multicultural society. If people are able merely to forbid bad speech then good speech in opposition to it may disappear while the ideas we choose to force underground have a nasty habit of taking on lives of their own in those dark places. Nor is offence a sufficiently high standard for many of the same reasons. I hope your offence at bigotry never ceases if only it motivates you to speak vigorously against the offending harm. But if we're going to change laws to effectively make expressions of racism legal, as if we're not simply getting around it by calling it something else already, then I think we can demand to take obscenity off the books and enshrine blasphemy as a form of protected speech. The situation as I understand it is therefore never so simple as to apply uniformly across the board anyway. Performers, and here I'm thinking especially of comedians, enjoy the protection of the proscenium when they take the stage and are able to say pretty much whatever they wish. Yet there is a creeping correctness moving steadily against comedy in the workplace today. This may not be a mistake if you've heard Jimmy Carr's material or maybe Jim Jefferies and want to repeat it over the water cooler. There is still such a thing as understanding the appropriateness of sharing dick jokes in mixed company. But to bring this back to the political zeitgeist we're obviously in a lot of trouble given the way this country now makes prejudicial assumptions about the veracity of asylum seekers' claims for example. So maybe it's about time we have a fresh conversation about bigotry that chooses to limit it not by the power of the law but by the strength of our character, because if we lack that then the sheer hypocrisy of print media not being able to express what blogs can and do will inevitably continue. Nor would I want bloggers policed so much as I simply think we have to recognise that speech prohibition has failed to halt the erosion the national mood towards people of difference. Maybe laws stopping us from discussing their character do as little to remind us that people difference should be judged on the content of their character because when we do so we're liable to be forced to recognise their merits in ways we're currently overlooking.

12 Nov 2013 1:11:21pmThis article is really a sad attempt to justify the existence of the Star Chambers of injustice that the Human Rights industry has foisted upon us through the actions of well-meaning but foolish politicians.There is no mention of course that the anti-semitism in Germany was nothing like the 'racism' he talks of in Australia today.  In fact the anti-semitism in Germany arose despite strict anti-racism laws in Weimar Germany.Talk of racism and hunting for it in as many contexts as possible in fact promotes racism and other forms of intolerance. It concentrates on what divides us instead of what unites us.  It is an evil act.Lastly, I really wish people would stop confusing deeds and speech.  Freedom of speech is absiolute. Defamation is not apeech but a deed, as are all the other examples given by the author of this article.

12 Nov 2013 1:24:55pmI'll try again.I believe that the conditions precedent for Kristallnacht and any such are:1. A breakdown in the norms of human decency between the members of a society; and 2. a breakdown in government structure such that the military or the police are given (or assume) inappropriate roles in civilian government.Condition "1" is occurring for multitudinous reasons that I won't go into here;and condition "2" has been achieved by a military man being given the right to tell me, or not tell me, what as a citizen I have a right to know and the matter of the Premier, the parliament, the judiciary and the Police force in Queensland with respect to the enaction and administration of the "bikie" laws.

But the 'piece of paper' , you mention is more powerful than you believe  and not so easy to dismiss. For 'piece of paper' I read enlightened  and secular schooling.Education and intellectual exploration enables people to reject a totality of received ideas in favour of their own more uniquely compiled thought.The teenager Malala Yousafzai wrote 'I dreamt of a country where education would prevail'Thats all. 'The violence under the skin' you speak of is no more than the mad rage of the shut in mind. If she whose brain was formally targeted for destruction does not fear it why should we?
