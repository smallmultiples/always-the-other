Organisers of a new exhibition on Chinese migration hope it will provide visitors with a better understanding of Australia's diverse Chinese community.Bridge of Memories opened in Canberra this morning. It explores the complexities of identity through migrants' first-hand accounts.The exhibition complements the Beijing Olympic torch relay, which will be run through the national capital next Thursday.The multimedia display was created by the Museum of Chinese Australian History in Melbourne and features photographs and recorded interviews with migrants who relocated to Australia between 1950 and today.Curator Lorinda Cramer says it provides a rare insight into the lives of migrants."We've actually sat down with someone who's come across after 1950 and spoken to them about why they came, what they're motivations for coming have been, what they thought Australia would be like and what they've actually done since they've arrived here," she said."We're also trying to place that into a bit of context - looking at what was happening in that country at the time people started to migrate across, also what was happening here in Australia and also our changing immigration policies."She says some of the migrants' stories are difficult to tell."A lot of people overcome great difficulties to get here. Some of the stories are really heartbreaking," she said."Others are really positive - people came for opportunity, for education, for business as skilled migrants so there's also some really, really positive stories in here."The one thing that has come though from all of these people is that Australia has given them so much opportunity."Ms Cramer says she hopes visitors leave with a better understanding of Australia's Chinese community.She says the exhibition will surprise many."A lot of people still think of Chinese migration as happening during the gold rush or the post gold rush period, but there are so many more who have come after that," she said."Many left their homeland and their parents or grandparents or great grandparents may have left China 50 years ago, 70 years ago, even longer, and moved into another part of the Asia Pacific."We now have huge numbers of ethnic Chinese people not coming directly from China but from another country in between. I think perhaps a lot of people aren't aware of that."Bridge of Memories will be on display in the Showcase Gallery at Commonwealth Place on the shores of Lake Burley Griffin until April 27.The exhibition will then tour nationally before becoming a permanent display at the Museum of Chinese Australian History in Melbourne.
