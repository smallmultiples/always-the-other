A Chinese-Australian advocacy group wants attention given in the New South Wales election race to the issue of bullying in schools.The Chinese Australian Forum says many Asian parents are worried about violence in schools, especially bullying.Forum President Tony Pang says while the Liberal Party has released a policy to introduce more school counsellors, more significant change is needed."Both of the parties have not done adequately in terms of bringing up policy in addressing racial bullying and bullying at school," Mr Pang said.Mr Pang says the state's Anti-Discrimination Act should be amended to make racial harassment illegal, similar to Western Australian legislation.He says there has been an increase in school bullying for all students, particularly in cyberspace.
