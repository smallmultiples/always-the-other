A court has ordered three Fairfax journalists to reveal their sources for stories about a property developer and federal Labor MP Joel Fitzgibbon "in the interests of justice".Justice Lucy McCallum ordered that The Age newspaper and three journalists - Richard Baker, Philip Dorling and Nick McKenzie - hand over documents that identify sources behind stories about Chinese-Australian businesswoman Helen Liu and former defence minister Mr Fitzgibbon. Ms Liu applied for the documents ahead of a possible defamation case. In 2010 The Age reported that Ms Liu, who is a Labor Party donor, paid Mr Fitzgibbon $150,000 which he did not declare. Mr Fitzgibbon denies receiving the money.He has started defamation proceedings in the ACT Supreme Court.Ms Liu has also issued a writ of defamation against The Age.In handing down her judgment in Sydney, Justice McCallum said after considering the contents of the correspondence before her, she was not persuaded there was any tangible risk of adverse consequences to the sources if their identity was revealed, beyond the risk of them being sued for defamation and the impact upon their relationship (if any) with the plaintiff.  "In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of justice to exercise my discretion in favour of the plaintiff," she said."Accordingly, I order that the defendants give discovery to the plaintiff of all documents that are or have been in their possession which relate to the identity or whereabouts of sources."  It is thought The Age newspaper will appeal the judge's decision.The matter is likely to return to court on Friday.
