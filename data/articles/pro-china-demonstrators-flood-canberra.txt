Thousands of pro-China supporters and a smaller number of pro-Tibet protestors have indundated Canberra for today's Olympic torch relay.Central Canberra and the area around Parliament House is awash with people, flags and noise, with drums and dancing dragons amid what it primarily a carnival atmosphere.The highway into Canberra has been carrying busload after busload of people from Sydney and further afield since well before dawn.The number of Chinese supporters far outweighs the number who have come to voice their concern over human rights in Tibet.Police have already been forced to intervene between rival groups, asking two sets of opposing demonstrators to disperse near Reconciliation Place, where the relay will start later this morning.The head of the Canberra torch relay committee admits organisers have been caught by surprise by organised Chinese support for the torch."We didn't expect this reaction from the Chinese community," committee head Ted Quinlan admitted.'[It is] obviously a well-coordinated plan to take the day by weight of numbers. But we have assurances that it will be done peacefully."Tibetan supporters say they are already feeling overwhelmed by the numbers of Chinese supporters.Sam Wong from the ACT Chinese Australian Association says both sides have given assurances their protest action will not turn violent."Australian people in general are peaceful, harmonious, loving people," he said."Among all the communities, including the Chinese and Tibetan, those who live in Australia, I personally have had to deal with them in many, many years, they are strongly supportive of peace and harmony, because we are a great multicultural nation here."Overnight a small crowd of pro-Tibet demonstrators held a candlelit prayer vigil outside the Chinese embassy, just a few blocks from the route of the torch relay.Security will be tight today as the Olympic torch relay swings into action.Barricades line the entire route and road blocks will ensure the public is kept at a distance from the runners.A one-kilometre convoy will follow the runner incorporating 18 vehicles and 6 motorcycles.ACT chief police officer Michael Phelan says he is hopeful protesters make for a peaceful day."Both our intelligence and our liaison with all of those groups has been very good," he said."They've assured us that they're looking for a peaceful event to try and showcase not only the message they want to get across but also showcase Australia and Canberra."
