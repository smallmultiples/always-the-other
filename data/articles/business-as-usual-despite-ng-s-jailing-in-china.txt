An Australian businessman's lengthy jail sentence in China will not deter others from trying their luck in what can be an extremely lucrative market, analysts say.Yesterday Matthew Ng was given a 14-and-a-half-year sentence, of which he will serve 13 years, for embezzlement, corruption, bribery and falsifying records.It is not the first time a foreign businessman has fallen foul of Chinese authorities and experts say it will not be the last.John Lee, from the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney, says the odds were stacked against Ng. "In China, by the time a case gets to court, statistically you have a 95 per cent chance of getting convicted when it's a criminal charge," Mr Lee said."The second reason is that he had angered quite a few business people linked to a local Chinese [state-owned enterprise]. "Now that local Chinese SOE had extremely close links with the municipal government and the prosecutors and the judges appointed by that precise local government."Before his arrest in 2010, Ng was running a travel company and doing well in China. He bought a majority stake in a state-owned enterprise, but he says when he was asked to sell it back things started to go wrong.He was arrested and charged with embezzlement, corruption, bribery and falsifying company records.And in what was thought to be a procedural hearing yesterday, he was handed his sentence, shocking both the defendant and his family.Two business associates of Ng were given a 16- and a three-and-a-half-year sentence respectively on related charges.It does not bode well for another Chinese-Australian, Charlotte Chou, who is also facing criminal charges in Guangzhou arising from a business dispute.Last year Australian-Chinese Rio Tinto executive Stern Hu received a 10-year sentence for bribery and espionage."I think it's reaffirming once again that when foreigners do business in China, more often than not you're doing business with either essentially managed or locally managed state-owned enterprises," Mr Lee said."And the state-owned enterprises are effectively not just owned by the Chinese Communist Party but actually staffed, the senior management are staffed and appointed by the Chinese Communist Party. "So if you have a commercial dispute with a Chinese SOE, there is every chance that you can land yourself in some trouble." Mr Lee says Chinese-Australians are more at risk because they tend to think they understand the culture better."In China connections are the real currency in terms of getting ahead and there are obviously cultural advantages for an ethnic Chinese businessperson to operate in China," he said."But the problem is that the closer to the eye of the storm you get, the more dangerous it becomes."He says other people will not be turned off trying to to business in China."I think there is so much money to be made in China that businesses will tend to go in there," he said."It's not necessarily greed, it's really the fact that you have in a world at the moment the only major growth market."But it will call into question the desirability, I suppose, of China's rise, China's commercial leadership and more broadly, China's political leadership."I think there is so much money to be made in China that businesses will tend to go in there. Ng's wife, Niki Chow, says her husband will appeal the decision and is calling on the Australian Government to intervene. "He was shocked. He kept looking at me and the lawyer. How come the judge could say this kind of thing?" she said."I hope the Australian Government could complain to the Chinese government that the verdict is really, really harsh."But Mr Lee says he does not think Chinese authorities will be swayed. "The reason I say this is that this is a municipal government, and even if the appeal goes ahead it will be a provincial government," he said."Australia will have much less influence diplomatically compared, for example, were it to be the central government in Beijing."A spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs says the Government has made clear to Chinese authorities its strong interest in Ng's case. She says the case has been raised on several occasions in bilateral meetings, including in a meeting between Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Chinese premier Wen Jiabao in Beijing in April.
