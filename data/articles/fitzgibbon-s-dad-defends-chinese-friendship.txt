Joel Fitzgibbon's father has confirmed that the Defence Minister is friends with a Chinese-Australian businesswoman but says there is nothing improper about it.It has been alleged the Defence Department has been spying on the Minister, using Australia's spy agency, the Defence Signals Directorate (DSD), to access information technology systems within the Minister's office to gain information about his relationship with a wealthy Chinese-born woman.If true, it shows a major breakdown of trust between the Department and the Minister.The Defence Minister has a political pedigree. His father, Eric, used to be a federal MP and visited China in the early 1990s.It was during this trip that Joel Fitzgibbon met the Liu family. He has maintained a friendship with Helen Liu ever since.It is said the families are so close, they exchange birthday and Christmas presents, and Mr Fitzgibbon rents a property from Ms Liu.Ms Liu has also been a generous donor to the NSW Labor Party and regularly travels to China.But the friendship apparently raised concerns within the Defence Department.It is alleged the Department carried out the investigation into the Minister's friendship with Ms Liu well before the recent SAS pay bungle, in which the Minister described the Department as "incompetent".Fairfax newspapers claim DSD even accessed Mr Fitzgibbon's IT system in his Ministerial office to find information about Ms Liu and is understood to have found her banking records.The Minister is not talking this morning but his Father is."The friendship goes back a long way," Eric Fitzgibbon said."To suggest that there's some danger to Australian Defence for me or Joel to be associated with the Liu family is just plainly ridiculous."Eric Fitzgibbon says there are no reasons to be concerned about his family's links to the Lius and China.Alan Behm, an independent adviser on security and risk who once headed two divisions with the Defence Department, says if there is any truth in the allegations, it represents a 'very serious turn in the relationship between the public sector departments and the Government'."If there's any truth in it at all, it is totally improper for a department of state to investigate the affairs of its minister," he said."There are appropriate channels for doing that, and that of course has to be at the direction of the Prime Minister. So if this is an unauthorised access using DSD's facilities to the IT systems of the Minister, then whoever undertook that really has to be dismissed."I think I'd simply refer people back to the terrible relationship that existed between a minister and an organisation back in 1975, when the then Attorney General, Mr Lionel Murphy, had no confidence at all in ASIO and that led to a very serious breakdown in the relationship between that organisation and the minister."It led to a series of very, very important investigations and so on. The whole thing led to the fall of the government."
