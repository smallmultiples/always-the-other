More than 130,000 people welcomed the Year of the Sheep in Sydney, in the largest Chinese New Year celebration outside China.Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore announced on Sunday night to the large crowd enjoying festivities that it would be the last Chinese New Year parade down George Street while the road is closed for work to create the city's new light rail network.The crowd, packed 20-people deep in some places, had turned out on a humid Sydney night to welcome in the Year of the Sheep.People also perched themselves on window ledges and sat precariously on shop awnings to get a better view.The Sydney Chinese New Year Twilight Parade is claimed by the council to be the biggest celebration of the New Year outside China."The Twilight Parade is an excellent way we celebrate Sydney's cultural diversity," Cr Moore said. The parade featured more than 3,000 performers from community and business groups, as well as performers flown in from China, Taiwan and Korea.The opening troupe of performers celebrated the role Chinese shepherds played in the early days of the Australian wool industry.They were followed by a five-metre merino sheep, named Wisdom, which glowed in the fading evening light.The City of Sydney brought more than 150 performers from Sichuan, Shaanxi and Beijing in China to take part in the event which is in its 19th year.Festival creative director Gill Minervi married the parade of people with street fireworks, flame throwers and artistic projections on city buildings.The performers turned off George Street at Goulburn Street and wound their way through the narrow streets of Chinatown before finishing at the Chinese Gardens in Darling Harbour.The breadth of Chinese Australian society was represented, with groups of local Shanghai, Fujian, Guangzhou and Beijing people taking part.Children from Darlington, Glebe, and Ultimo primary schools entertained the crowd with their performance titled Calm, in which they counted sheep on a giant abacus.Different groups represented signs of the Chinese zodiac including the Pig and the Rooster.The festivities ended with a fireworks display over Cockle Bay Wharf in Darling Harbour.
