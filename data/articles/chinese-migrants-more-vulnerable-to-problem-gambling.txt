Chinese migrant gamblers are five times more likely to fall victim to problem gambling than the general gambling population, new research has found.Class ideals and cultural isolation are contributing to a higher rate of problem gambling in Australia’s Chinese community, with a lack of culturally appropriate support services adding to the vulnerability.A Monash University report, released this week for Responsible Gambling Awareness Week, found cultural beliefs in luck and auspicious signs have contributed to higher prevalence of problem gambling in the Chinese-Australian community.“People talked about testing your luck – it’s really ingrained in the culture,” researcher Dr Harriet Radermacher said.“Casinos are associated with wealth and class.”Australia's casinos are taking advantage of the Chinese community's taste for gambling and glitzy casinos, using language and cuisine to cater to the market. In Sydney, James Packer's planned $1.3bn Barangaroo Crown casino is expected to lure Chinese visitors and migrants in particular.“People talked a lot about the sense of freedom they felt when they came here and how this could lead to embracing the gambling culture,” Dr Radermacher said. A counsellor with the gambling support hotline ‘Chinese Peer Connection’, Fang Yu, said clients were waiting too long to call for assistance.“It’s sad that people only seek help when their financial issue is at its worst stage, when they’ve lost everything – their house, car, and in serious debt,” she said.She said the culturally inviting aspects of casinos and the lack of early awareness programs tailored to the Chinese community make it very hard for migrants to avoid gambling.“In our Chinese culture gambling is very much a recreational activity – we do it on a daily base when gathering with friends or festival time. "It’s a fun activity – we call it social gambling,” she said.“But it’s not legal (in China). We don’t go to casinos, so it’s a transition time when (Chinese people) arrive in Australia and there aren’t the restrictions around what you can or can’t do.”This, coupled with the difficulty for new non-English speaking migrants to find culturally appropriate social activities, often leads to a dependency on gambling.“Imagine people being in a society where they’re in a very low social status, but they can go to one place where they can be upper class people, be proud, be treated nicely, they have food and nice lights, and it attracts them,” Ms Fang Yu said.“It is a way of coping, it’s one thing they can say ‘I’m good at it’.”Researcher Dr Harriet Radermacher said gambling is well documented in the Australian community, but not within specific ethnic groups. "The percentage of Australians that gamble is equivalent to Canada or England by the percentage per capita, but the amount people are spending when they gamble is two to three times higher in Australia,” she said.“That’s why we’re labelled the gambling nation, and it’s quite shocking really.”She said culturally appropriate support needs to be developed for migrant communities.“Australia is a multicultural nation and we don’t know enough about the ethnic voices,” she said.Call the Chinese Peer Support gambling hotline on 1300 755 878 for help, or call Gambler's Help line on 1800 858 858.
