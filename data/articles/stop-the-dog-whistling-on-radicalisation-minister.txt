Andrew Robb wants quick fixes and easy answers for the problem of radicalisation, but his framing of the "Muslim" as a problem to be solved isn't helping one bit, writes Sarah Malik.My phone is exploding with Happy Eid! texts.Except it's not Eid. Not for me at least.The texts are mainly from my well-meaning white friends who have watched Eid celebrations at Lakemba mosque on Channel Nine.I'm celebrating the next day, like half the rest of the state's Muslims. The old school method of marking the end of Ramadan involves waiting to see the arc of the new moon indicating the beginning of the lunar month as opposed to the fixed scientific calendar method.This is one of the million fine details of the complex and diverse Muslim communities who hail from dozens of varied cultures and strains, but are forced into a uniformity by an external culture that imposes modes of understanding aligned with its own understandings of religious ritual, politics and practice.Chief among these is the myth of a unified and Vatican-like leadership hierarchy Andrew Robb seems to be appealing to in his demands on ABC's Q&A on Monday night that Muslim leaders pull in their radicalised youth.One of the great attractions of Sunni Islam is the lack of hierarchical or mediating priest-class, with a focus on the individual's direct relationship to God.Sure there are imams who lead prayer, and scholars who have spent years nutting out points of law, and an axis of orthodoxy most mainstream leaders are guided by. Beyond that, leaders are made more by their following and popularity rather than anointed by overarching councils or bodies.This makes things difficult for politicians like Mr Robb, who needs someone to cop the flak for the rash of young nutcases running to the Middle East.When it's young Muslim men, the community is expected to take responsibility.Only when it's a young white male like Jake Bilardi, there is a recognition of the risk faced by young, isolated people with complex personal compulsions and histories that make them vulnerable to the call of extremism.There is a barrage of material trying to understand the lure of militancy. Is it the search for belonging? Alienation and marginalisation? Anger at foreign intervention in the Muslim world? The promise of an Islamic golden age utopia in the face of political humiliation? Sex and kittens? The internet? An outlet for existing criminal tendencies, or just a way to escape the tedium of ordinary life?One thing remains clear, there seems to be no one-size-fits-all approach to the trajectory of these lone and few individuals who often leave behind their own baffled and distraught families and communities.These few individuals rarely interact with mainstream leaders or mosques. Like most young people, not just Muslims, traditional religious authorities (read: old people) have failed to connect with the millennials' quest for meaning in a changing social media world.This is not necessarily a bad thing.The internet, like most things, is a reflection of the people who use it.Social media provides communities for minorities rarely given a voice in the mainstream. Hamza Yusuf and Ustadh Nouman Ali Khan are among a spate of celebrity sheikhs that have connected online with global youth audiences.They successfully market a homegrown western Islam, that despite their detractors is grounded in the world migrant kids can understand and for all its conservatism generally stress political participation and integration.Mr Robb wants quick fixes and easy answers for the problem of radicalisation.There is one simple one that I can offer free of charge.The constant framing of the "Muslim" as a problem to be solved by politicians and media who use these communities to whip up ratings and dog whistle politics is a disgrace. It is far disproportionate to any risks posed.It only adds to the genuine anguish of Muslim communities struggling against a small but virulent association of extremism with the added burden of racial aggression and hysteria.Sarah Malik is Sydney-based journalist and writer.

Comments for this story are closed.22 Apr 2015 9:30:39amAbbott's approach to radicalisation is very concerning. They seem to want to goad Muslim youth into a fight. The shallowness of the government's argument for the war in Iraq, its demonising of Islam, lack of engagement and his yelp for a  "Team Australia" is divisive and bound to end in more violent demonstrations.Somebody on the LNP side please bend his ear so he turns from his combative approach before it is too late.

22 Apr 2015 2:20:28pmPlease.At the very core of the Islamist narrative is the idea that Muslims are hapless victims (of Western persecution, political scapegoating...you name it, it's there).'Moderate' Muslims (and their apologists) everywhere reenforce this narrative everyday. It's an utterly unhealthy poison, particularly for young impressionable minds already struggling with identity and a sense of purpose.If Muslims (individuals, communities and countries) are serious about stepping out of the margins, they must snuff out the victim mentality that pervades and undermines every aspect of their lives.
Alert moderator
22 Apr 2015 3:37:24pm"stepping out of the margins" - you've got them marginalized already, says it all about your post.What is at the core of this article is that it is wrong to marginalize anyone or any group in our society (even more so for political purposes.) What is unhealthy is isolating, separating or differentiating a group, in other words marginalizing a group. It enables a society to dehumanize,  for instance, a group of people.
Alert moderator
22 Apr 2015 10:44:19pmWhile I agree with you Bob, any group that identifies itself as "different" from the rest, be it by virtue of their language, culture, dress, religion or custom runs the risk of marginalisation. It is more likely when the differences are the means by which the group maintains its coherence and practically a lay down miserere when some of those differences are anti-thetical to the values etc held by everyone else.I don't care what people believe, I don't care what they wear, but I do care where when Muslims require me to change in order to accommodate them.  I was once physically attacked because I was reading the Koran, my attacker (a young man from Lebanon who had been here less than a year) considered it blasphemous for an apostate like me to be  touching the sacred book.  I was picking up some kids from school (for friends), couldn't find them so I asked another student (who happened to be female) where they were and got a whack on the back of the head from her grand father because in his view I had no right to speak to her (it was in the school hall).We have long had a Turkish community in Australia, without any fuss or bother and I note that they don't appear to be to radicalised by living here.  It's a pity that "other Muslims" don't follow their example.

24 Apr 2015 12:59:29amBob, your understanding of Islam is astounding. It is a fundamental tenet of Islamic belief, taught in the Koran, that non-Muslims, referred to as 'infidels' are lesser human beings than Muslims, and are in fact cursed and already destined for hell because of their unbelief. Muslims are told by the Koran not to even associate with unbelievers unless absolutely necessary. As a result Muslims only ever mix and socialize within their own communities. This "otherness" is not something that is thrust upon Muslims. It is something fundamental and inherent in their own belief system. In the Islamic reality however, it is not the Muslims who disassociate themselves from mainstream society, it is mainstream society that disassociates itself from Islam because the infidels and unbelievers refuse to accept the truth of Mohammed.
Alert moderator
22 Apr 2015 6:32:23pmLet's put this another way. Every Western country that has allowed Muslims to settle there in the last 20, 30 or 50 years is having the same problem, everyone.  Islamic terrorism albeit at low levels is present in every country in the West and to many non-Muslim countries elsewhere. In many Muslim countries Islamic terrorism is at horredouly high levels and Muslim peoples are suffering greatlySo the cause of Islamic terrorism is not the Australian government, it is not Western ideology but the problem is the interpretation that some, many but definitely not all Muslims have of the Koran. FYI. The first inkling that we had of problems of Islamic extremism in Australia was in the 1990's when Defence members were threatened by local Muslims. Australia allowed that problem to fester and here we are today. So again it is not the current government but something that has been building for years. When my ancestors emmigarted here they worked hard, supported community groups, and respected the laws and values of their new home. We see now that many of the newer groups don't have that thinking and want Australia to change to suit them. Not since 1788 with the First Fleet has any group of peope asked the existing citizens to give up what they have for a bunch of new people who have never given anything back in return.

22 Apr 2015 3:55:36pmI have confidence in the police but no confidence what so ever in our government.When a father of the youth arrested in Melbourne for being involved in a planned attack on Anzac day says he has no problem with his son being affiliated with an organisation that has an alliance with ISIS that says it all.For a Muslim leader to criticise the way police handled the situation is a sign of weakness and hatred.The police did an excellent job of arresting the offender coming down on him like a ton of bricks and to say they were to harsh is outrageous. Would you want the police to use a wet lettuce and handle the offender with kid gloves, there is far to much leniency towards the offenders brought about by to do gooders and the goody goodies, I doubt it very much if it was one of your family that was murdered or slain by the planned terrorist act it would be a different story.

22 Apr 2015 6:58:38pmThe police haven't arrested an offender.  They have arrested a suspect.  He may be an offender.  If he is tried, the court will decide that.  It is not at all the job of the police to "come down like a ton of bricks" in a liberal democracy where the rule of law applies, however it may be done in a police state.  I hope they didn't do that and that the complaints against them are found to be unjustified.

22 Apr 2015 2:30:46pmThere are no "radical Muslims" in Australia.  The scarce handful of events, such as at the Lindt cafe, are far more accurately described through the prism of mental illness or common criminality than some sort of existential threat.  Of course, that doesn't stop hardliners in the LNP from whipping up fear and loathing to hoover up the votes of the community's racist underbelly.

Accept Islam completely including its sharia laws and worldview (basically summed up as there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is His prophet?)I hear that Malaysia right now is seriously considering legislating Islamic criminal laws into effect, which are the sort that says a thief shall have his hand chopped off and women that got raped must produce 4 pious male eyewitnesses to the event or else face charges of her own. The minority non-Muslim Malaysians are the ones most strenuously opposing these planned laws.

In fact, they are being idolatrous.  I remember being called a warmonger because I thought surrendering to the North Vietnamese invasion of South Vietnam was wrong.  When I said I wanted to help those being attacked, I was told they asked for it.  That they were also warmongers, merely for not surrendering.I can see the resemblance to the current situation.

23 Apr 2015 4:48:35amWhat you seem to forget is that to many of those who speak the loudest about racism and religious intolerance, white, 'right wing' 'westerners' are apparently the only perpetrators.The institutionalised racism and religious intolerance in Malaysia is almost never mentioned or acknowledged on The Drum, partly, I think, because even at the level of childish political fanaticism which is self-evident within these comments, these people realise that this may well actually be something that they are unable to legitimately blame Tony Abbott for. Then again, maybe I ascribe an undeserved level of common sense to such individuals.

22 Apr 2015 10:48:11amThere's a natural tendency to want to separate out "us' from the "baddies". So we look for things that the "baddies" have in common.In World War 2 the "baddies" were the Germans and the Japanese. Now the "baddies" are Muslims. We then create caricatures to re-assure ourselves that the "baddies" are really different.So the Germans are very cold and efficient which is why only the Germans could have been capable of the Holocaust. And the Japanese are a cruel race and so only the Japanese could have been capable of those horrendous war crimes and treatment of POWs.And now with Muslims it's a case of only those Muslims could be capable of extremism.This is a natural response. But it's wrong. And people really need to understand this because it plays directly into the hands of extremists.Human beings are capable of the most horrendous acts. Every single one of us. Lets take a trip around the globe:There have been at least 4 genocides in 20th century:1. the Turkey-Armenian Genocide;2. the Holocaust;3. Bosnia;4. Rwanda.Meanwhile other countries have witnessed brutal periods:1. The Khmer Rouge in Cambodia;2. Darfur;3. Stalins various crimes including the Katyn massacre in Poland and a forced famine in Ukraine which killed 7m people;4. The various crimes of dictators including South American dictators such as Pinochet and Videla, European dictators such as Franco and Mussolini, African dictators such as Idi Amin and Mugabe and Maoist China;5. The massacre of muslims by Buddhists in Burma (yeah the Buddhists can be bad too).Then you get more localised brutality:1. the lynchings in Southern America;2. Northern Ireland;3. South African apartheid.There is not a corner of the world and not a culture, religion, political ideology or group of people who have not at one time in the last 100 years done really nasty stuff to each other. If we go beyond 100 hundred years then we just fall off the scale.This is what is in us. The causes are different but it all involves humans de-humanising other humans.To say that extremists are only committing these crimes because they are "Muslims" is the same as saying the Holocaust only happened in Germany because they were Germans. It adds nothing to anyone's understanding of the root causes and only magnifies the perceived differences between groups which is exactly what extremists of all variety want people to believe.

22 Apr 2015 11:02:43amWell written and right to the point, FGR.We can blame the illegal invasion of Iraq by Bush and Howard for what is happening now.Every country that has threatened the supremacy of the US Dollar has been overthrown by the United States of Amnesia.Both Hussein & Gaddafi both wanted to sell their oil using the gold standard. Result: both countries invaded or armed the uprising that has now created ISIS and other terrorist organisations.

22 Apr 2015 11:38:04amIf you can explain ''what is happening now'' by the ''illegal invasion of Iraq", then how do you explain the 9/11 attacks. Or the bombing of US embassies in 1998. Or the bombing of the WTC in 1993. Maybe it makes you feel better to think there is a logical causality to jihadism. But you fundamentally misunderstand the mindset and therefore the threat.

22 Apr 2015 1:13:25pmNot that I am getting into this but the US hardly endeared itself to the Muslim world when it imposed a brutal dictator on Iran, blindly supported Israel and did other regretful things like abandon Afghanistan to the Taliban. Things are never black and white. To highlight the grey is not to condone it is simply to appreciate that things don't happen in vacuum.

22 Apr 2015 1:51:17pmWell, Tabanus, from little seeds, big trees grow. It is surely absurd to believe that the invasion of Iraq - and the power vacuum it left behind - had nothing to do with the formation of Daesh. If Saddam were still in power, Shiite militias (backed by Iran) would not then have terrorised the Sunni minority, who would not then have looked to Daesh as the only force strong enough to counter the existential threat posed by the Shiite militias. We created the conditions for a sectarian civil war, and are now surprised at the radicalising effects of that war? Revisit the debate that surrounded the decision to invade Iraq. Journalists like Robert Fisk warned that what would happen is exactly what did happen. People like AFP Commissioner, Mick Keelty, warned the Howard government that the invasion would increase the risk of terror attacks in Australia, and he was silenced for his efforts.  The warnings were there. We chose to ignore them. We cannot now say that we did not know.

23 Apr 2015 11:06:03amI do notice a lot of self-awareness lacking on many "right-wing" commentators over how foreign policy impacts anger  towards us.However, I do notice that a lot of people who cite it as a reason tend to completely capitalize upon it as the sole and only cause of Islamic extremism.It's not;Let's be clear- foreign intervention promotes them to hate us; nothing else. It has not transformed a single secular Muslim into an extremist- it just makes extremist muslims (who are already high abrasive towards Western societies) want to kill us. That's it. However I'd say this. If Australia had NOT participated in the last few wars in the Middle East, a lot of domestic Muslim extremists would instead be signing up for jihad groups and leaving our shores forever (hopefully) rather than plotting as many terrorist attacks here. Whether our government would have jumped on the opportunity to prevent them from returning is another question.

22 Apr 2015 1:08:41pmSays the person who coined the term. Raphael Lemkin, described the Armenian massacre as a genocide. He said:"I became interested in genocide because it happened so many times. It happened to the Armenians, then after the Armenians, Hitler took action." You are right though no international court has held it was a genocide. In fact, the same can probably be said of the crimes in Darfur and probably now in Iraq and Syria with ISIS.The Rome Statute defines genocide as:any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:(a) Killing members of the group;(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. I think that's what the Turks did to the Armenians.

22 Apr 2015 11:36:04amFGR, "To say that extremists are only committing these crimes because they are "Muslims" is the same as saying the Holocaust only happened in Germany because they were Germans."The crucial mistake many in the west make is that they can't comprehend the difference between a religion and race/nationality. Most of time it's a deliberate ploy to stop getting at the heart of the problem, and stop the debate. You know because it doesn't back up the utopia of the elites. What many Germans did, didn't happen in thin air, that is exactly the case with Muslims. What underpins Islamic extremism is Islamic theology. With out acknowledging this fact we will never solve the never ending Islamic threat.

22 Apr 2015 11:52:03amPretty much uncontroversial: violence, terror and brutality are not restricted to any nation.  The argument falls over, when you try to extend this from accidents of birth to adoption of ideology.I don't think I have ever heard anyone claim that the Holocaust occurred because there were Germans.  The Holocaust occurred because a lot of Germans adopted Nazism.To defend an ideology because other ideologies have done bad things seems a little strange.I can criticise both Nazis killing Jews and Muslim fanatics killing Jews.  I can criticise any brutality, whether committed by Saddam Hussein (that poor man attacked by nasty Americans) or by Genghis Khan.Should I try to excuse any of the above by pointing out that that the Romans crucified rebels?Just say it: murder and terrorism carried out in the name of Islam is wrong, it is evil.  No hedging, no "buts", no excuses.If you dare not say it, then do not complain if I suspect you quietly support it.

22 Apr 2015 1:44:12pmWhat's all this quietly supporting business? I listed some examples of when and where people did really bad stuff to bring some persecutive. That's it.I didn't go into the causes of each awful thing because I haven't got all day. The issue is not ideology. The ideology acts as unifying thing but the ideology is a complete red herring. People believe in all sorts of nonsense. You believe I secretly support terrorists. For god sake the Protestants and Catholic read the same book but still ended up killing each other in Northern Ireland. And guess what - it had nothing to do with religion. It was to do with money and power and who had stuff (like access to housing, education and fair voting) and who didn't have stuff. The reasons are varied. For example in the case of Nazi Germany different historians have speculated that it was a sense of injustice after WW1 and economic hardship after the Wall St Crash and the collapse of the Weimar Republic Now I wonder could this possibly be applied to the Middle East?1. Sense of injustice? 2. Economic hardship?What we are dealing with maybe for the first time is people voluntarily going to the bad place to do the bad things. That is a new one I'll give you that.

22 Apr 2015 3:50:13pmAs I said, I thought quite plainly, the IRA never claimed to represent the Catholic Church.  They were a political organisation, with a political wing.  I do not remember IRA bombers screaming "Ave Maria!" or "Long live the Papacy!" as they self immolated.The Nazis, however, claimed to be Nazis and to carry out their atrocities because they were Nazis and wanted to spread Nazism.  Some of them died with "Heil Hitler" on their lips.In the current day, we have people who claim to be of a certain religion, who carry out their atrocities because they are members of that religion and want to spread that religion.  They too swear their allegiance to their motivating force in their last moments.Seems a pretty straightforward comparison.Could you not see any link with all those events I listed?

23 Apr 2015 3:53:14pmTabanus,"Some have started to attack coffee shops and police car parks."If you are talking about the Lindt Cafe incident and the stabbing of police in Melbourne, you are barking up the wrong tree. Incidents such as these are by no means uncommon in Australia. Sieges have been going on for at least as long as I can remember and it is definitely not uncommon for mentally ill young adults to clash violently with police. The mere fact that we treat the incidents differently depending on the religious beliefs of the perpetrator is a cause for concern in itself.When I was growing up, there were a number of sieges around Sydney, involving severely disturbed WW2, Korean and Vietnam War veterans. Thankfully most of these ended peacefully because the police and emergency services treated the incidents for what they were: mental health incidents. The hostages survived, the perpetrator survived, and the police and other emegency services survived. There was nothing terribly different about the Lindt Cafe siege, except that it does not appear that the Lindt Cafe was the orginal target and it was its unfortunate colocation with the offices of Channel 7 that put it in the firing line. The only real difference was the response of police and ASIO and, given the fact that the incident exploded shortly after Abbott's spectacular fall from grace in the polls, there is cause of serious suspicion that the reasons for not treating this incident as a common-or-garden mental-illness-driven hostage drama were political.We have a huge problem with mental illness in Australia and, at the moment, at least some of this problem is expressing itself in the form of violent acts. When these acts are carried out by members of the Islamic faith, we call it "terrorism" and go in with all guns blazing. If the perpetrator is a Christian or agnostic or Theosophist, the incident gets treated as a mental health incident and, in the vast majority of cases, everybody walks out alive.We have a SMALL problem with "Islamic" terrorism that we are making worse with our actions, and a HUGE problem with mental illness, that we are making worse with our inaction. Lets get our priorities straight.

23 Apr 2015 6:02:45pmVThere's a lot of literature around contemporary terrorism.Take a look.Factors such as psychology and socio-economic circumstance rarely play a part in motivating/triggering terrorism. Case study after case study (look at 9/11, the Madrid, London, Bali and Boston bombings, etc) illustrate the point. I fact, the contemporary terrorist is more likely to be rational and from a well to do family.The radicalisation process usually pivots around a crisis of identity and the search for purpose. This is where Islamism is so very dangerous. But more broadly, it's why the narrative of victimhood is so poisonous for young Muslims.Try harder.

23 Apr 2015 7:01:47pmAGB,"I fact, the contemporary terrorist is more likely to be rational and from a well to do family."The examples of terrorist incidents that you quote to support your characterisation of "the contemporary terrorist" are all drawn from the not-so-recent past, and were committed by terrorists who could in no way be considered "contemporary". Things have moved on a little since then. ISIS did not exist when these incidents occurred and its extraordinary and rather frightening success is the direct result of their employment of novel strategies and tactics. This is not that unusual. It has been happening since the Celts and the Germans used asymmetric tactics to clobber the Romans.The reason that the Western Empire (be it Rome, Spain, England or the US) has never been able to get on top of asymmetric warfare is the fundamentally dynamic nature of asymmetric strategy. ISIS deliberate targeting of the soft underbelly of our society has been very effective, and its effectiveness has been considerably enhanced by the hysterical reaction of western governments and the monopoly-controlled western media to the challenge.The best way of avoiding an attack via the soft underbelly is not to have a soft underbelly in the first place. So our best defence against ISIS asymmetric tactics is to build a more inclusive society, eliminate the sources of social alienation, and by getting serious in our approach to mental health. We can starve ISIS with compassion and courage, or we can feed them with our hysteria and cowardice. The choice is ours.

23 Apr 2015 4:18:17pmAnn,"If it were me in those circumstances, in that society, with that personal history, I may have done it too"Or, to put it another way: "there but for the grace of God go I".We KNOW that, for a growing number of young people, violent extremism and the prospect of dying violently in a foreign land appear as valid life choices. And we KNOW that such a choice is NOT a valid life choice. We also KNOW that these people are not lacking in intelligence and there is no indication that they are particularly evil or violent people until they decide to take up arms. We also have a fairly good understanding of how the "world view" or "paradigm" of individual human beings is formed.So we have all of the pieces of the puzzle. All that we really need to do now is to join the dots and figure out what it is about our modern civil society that is so radically skewing the world views of so many young, intelligent, promising youngsters.My own feeling is that we have allowed ourselves to lose touch with what it is to be a human being and, as a result, the civil society that we have built over countless generations has become corrupted and no longer serves our needs in a rational way. If the symptoms displayed by our society manifested themselves in a single human being, we would classify it as mental illness, so it is probably not that surprising that our crazy civil society is going to produce more than its fair share of mentally ill people.Mental illness rates are like a miner's canary - the first indicator that something is going wrong. Our civil society is ill, and it is making our young people ill. If we can fix this, ISIS will have no teeth.

Secondly, your conclusion about the Germans is erroneous - the Germans were singularly responsible for the Holocaust. Where else should the rest of the world have turned to fix that problem but the Germans? It was never suggested every German was responsible - the vast majority were not, just like Islam. But to suggest the responsibility for the Holocaust should be shared 'because we all must take responsibility' would be ridiculous. Similar to the situation with Islamic terror now.

23 Apr 2015 11:19:17amWhen people remember the Holocaust they seem to immediately associate it with Germany. What they seem to forget or do not know is that antisememtism was rife throughout Europe before the events of WW2. This includes the European victors of WW2, Russia, Britain and France. The Holocaust was the pinacle of all that hatred. Hitler spent a considerable amount of time before WW2 broke out and the Final Solution was implemented trying to deport the German Jews to another location. There were no willing takers for them depsite their education. training or perceived economic benefit. Rightly or wrongly the Germans of today have to bear the shame of the attrocities comitted by their forebears. Perhaps our descendants might have some shame to bear on our account for how we treated people who we perceived to be different to us (e.g. assylum seekers, muslims etc...).

22 Apr 2015 1:55:26pmIt is basically true that all cultures are capable of violence and cruelty at different times but we cannot ignore the fact that some cultures become, at certain times, dominated by inhuman attitudes and practices. I recently re-read Hans Habe's classic book on the invasion of France by the Germans in 1940 "A Thousand Shall Fall."  The German troops who shelled villages and strafed fleeing refugees on the roads were every bit the callous, arrogant monsters that Hollywood movies later caricatured them as. The caricatures were true. Persuading Germans that they were superior to all other countries and all other races and bestowing high status and almost unlimited power on people who had only recently been lowly clerks and underpaid schoolteachers, bred a culture of brutality that culminated in  genocide. This is the power that an elite group, or even just one charismatic leader can wield given the right circumstances. The reason why WW2 came about was because France and Britain and other countries refused to accept that a whole country could turn bad. But it did. Similarly, the atrocities perpetrated by the Japanese were based on a similar belief in a racial superiority that justified killing those who were "unworthy." It is dangerous to underestimate the danger of these belief systems.

22 Apr 2015 11:40:56amI think you raise an extremely relevant point "anton".Abbotts continuous devaluing of Australian morals and ethics both nationally and internationally, is becoming increasingly  globally recognised, and the only sections of the Australian community who are supportive of his disgraced actions are those seemingly embracing his caustic culture through self centered driven and economical survival needs.Quick fixes are impossible solutions to century driven problems, and the divisive tactics of Abbott and his cohorts do nothing but further exasperate the situations. Divide and rule has long been a British, and Australian bunyip aristocratic neo colonial tactic and strategy, and Abbotts confirmed inability to be anything but a disenabler, a destroyer, and dysfunctional administrator, solidify his lack of true credentials in national leadership, and if anything reinforce the calls to replace him, along with his failed front bench at the earliest of opportunities.To every action there is an equal and positive reaction, and Abbott, by blatantly misrepresenting Australias true values on matters of national importance, on the international stage, can only reap the dislocation they sow. Though I strongly believe Abbott has now been well recognised by sections of the international community as a charlatan and fundamental drongo or nincompoop, to put it mildly, the repercussions to his abysmal  treatment of refugees, and military misadventures in the Middle East will eventually come home to roost.Abbotts ongoing inflamation of problems instead of endeavouring to search out solutions is characterised by his radical approach and ongoing radical policies, and radical right wing extreme behaviour.A two minute fix, hardly? Leave the two minute creations to the noodle manufacturers and the two minute newsbite alarmists we can watch on TV if we want to on a Sunday night I believe. But, then again what can we as a nation realistically expect from Abbott and his disgraced deceitful government?

Rather than show concern for the broader community and express relief that a terrorist attack is averted, the Muslim school teacher sole concern was on the apparent severity of the police raids in Melbourne.

22 Apr 2015 2:54:41pmThe Catholic community in Northern Ireland reacted in a similar way to police raids and searches.

Unfortunately the mistakes get more attention than the successes but then again you see the police brutality that was used on people like the Guildford Four and you can kind of understand.It's another reason why focusing on the "Muslim problem" is self-defeating.

It was more an uprising that happened to involve people of two religions, rather than it being a religious uprising. Maybe semantics but I think an important distinction.

23 Apr 2015 1:55:32pmfgr,"Unfortunately the mistakes get more attention than the successes"Had the same laws been in place in England as we have over here now, nobody would ever have known of the extreme and deliberate injustice inflicted in the "Guildford Four". The authors of the "anti-terrorism" laws that have stripped away so many of our fundamental rights have learned the lessons of the "Guildford Four" most studiously and have removed any possibility of any form of oversight or public scrutiny of the actions of the masked goons who smash up people's homes in the middle of the night.One of the most important features of a democratic society is that those who are given the responsibility of power, whether this be legislative power or the legal authority to employ lethal force, infringe upon private property, must be ACCOUNTABLE to the people and the law. If this is not so, then you don't have a democratic society.Our current anti-civil-liberties laws protect police, ASIO officers, public officials and politicians from exactly the type of public scrutiny that is required to prevent corruption, abuses of power and the official infringement of our most fundamental civil rights (life and liberty).From what we know so far, the "anti-terrorism" raids carried out over the past year or so (and which have a strange habit of happening just after a bad poll result for Tony Abbott) have failed to turn up even the slightest shred of admissable evidence to justify the raids or to convict anyone of an offence. We don't know how many people are being held without trial or charge, because it is against the law even to ask the question.Is this really how we should be honouring those who fought and died fro our freedom on the eve of the centenary of Gallipoli?

23 Apr 2015 1:30:57pmAGB," the Muslim school teacher sole concern was on the apparent severity of the police raids in Melbourne."And rightly so. It is an extremely serious issue that should concern every freedom-loving Australian. The powers granted to police and spies under Howard & Abbott's "anti-terrorism" (withdrawal of civil liberties) laws effectively allow them to operate effectively above and outside the law and free of any of the checks and balances that have been put in place to prevent the abuse of official power. And it is clear that this "wild west" approach to law and order is rubbing off on those conducting the raids, who appear to go out of their way to inflict damage on property and physical injuries on both suspects and innocent bystanders.We need to have these laws repealed. There is no reliable evidence to suggest that these raids have prevented a single terrorist attack, but they have been a very effective recruiting tool for ISIS, who have even used news footage of the raids in their propaganda.As the people of Germany found out to their extreme cost, irrational and drachonian "national security" laws that target people on the grounds of their semitic background or religion may create the illusion of security and peace in the short term, but inevitably enslave and terrorise thoe entire civil society. And unaccountable security forces like the SS or ASIO soon get out of control and turn against the people they are supposed to be protecting. We have seen this in Bjelke Petersen's Queensland and in Askin's NSW.We cannot protect our freedom by throwing it away. We should all stand together against the greatest threat to our freedom since WW2, but this time it is not a foreign army that threatens us, it is the laws forced upon us "for our own protection" and the cowardly masked goons who smash up peoples' homes in the middle of the night. This is particularly poingnant considering the proximity of the ANZAC Centenary, when many of us will rightly pause to contemplate the sacrifices made by so many to win and protect the freedoms we have so casually thrown away.

23 Apr 2015 6:19:28pmAGB,"There's a tension between 'freedom' and 'security'."Only in the minds of cowards.Benjamin Franklin said it best (and I paraphrase): anyone who would surrender their essential Liberties for the sake of security, will have neither and deserves neither.Liberty requires courage, both in individuals and in our civil society. It also involves considerable risk. We cannot expect to continue to enjoy the benefits of personal liberty unless we are also prepared to accept the risks. I think that a fair percentage of the brave men and women who have fought in the Australian forces in various wars understood this, and that is why they were prepared to accept the extreme risks of living in filthy trenches, eating fly-blown rations and having hot lead rained down upon you for weeks or even months on end, or venturing into the deep in tin cans filled with explosives, or flying into enemy territory in primitive aircraft.If the people we will be honouring in a couple of days' time were prepared to take such extreme risks for the sake of their, and our, Liberty I think that we owe it to them to accept the miniscule additional risk posed by Wahhabi terrorism and to continue to live proudly as free people. What sort of tribute are we paying to The Fallen, and what sort of an example are we setting for the generations who will follow us, if we roll over and surrender the Liberty that they died for simply to avoid a risk far smaller than the risk of being eaten by a shark, gored by a bull or struck by lightning?

The last genuine terrorist incidents in Australia occurred in Perth under the Howard government. They targeted Asian homes and businesses and were inspired by Howard's cynical use of the "race card" for short term political gain. I suppose that you COULD class the Cronulla Riots as "terrorism" in that they were a serise of violent acts designed to intimidate and terrify civilians, but there is a more accurate word for what happened, and that is "pogrom" - acts of mob violence committed with the intent of terrifying and intimidating a particular ethnic, racial or religious community.And before you go spouting on about the Lindt Cafe siege, that was a common-or-garden siege committed by a mentally disturbed person. It was no more a "terrorist" attack than the Mellish Siege of the 1970's (which ended peacefully thanks to sensible policing, and went on to become the subject of a successful Australian movie).What we are facing at the moment is, at least in part, a MENTAL HEALTH issue. ISIS has been very clever in targeting mentally ill youth, but it could not have done this had we not disregarded the plight of the mentally ill for so long and with such complete insensitivity to human suffering.ISIS may be attacking us through our soft underbelly, but the soft underbelly is of our own making. We can defeat ISIS simply by building a more compassionate civil society and taking our responsibilities toward the mentally ill a little more seriously.

But this is simply an effect or "symptom" of two more fundamental problems. Dealing with the symptom may give the appearance of effective action, but it does nothing to address the root problems and therefore ensures that these problems will continue to resurface.The first problem is that of our historical relationship with the people of the Middle East and followers of the Moslem faith in other parts of the world, including Australia. We cannot take back what we have done to them, and we cannot really blame them for resenting our treatment of and attitudes toward them. But at least we can stop repeating the same mistakes over and over again and, for this reason, I suggest that someone shove a sock in Robb's mouth until he promises to behave himself responsibly.The second problem is more of a curly one. Our civil society and economy has created a huge underclass of alientated youth, many of whom are ethnically or culturally connected to areas in which the West is still behaving badly. And the extreme and growing dysfunction of our civil society is also creating an epidemic of mental illness, especially psychotic and mood disorders, amongst our youth and young adults. These people are highly suggestible and tend to gravitate toward spectacular and dramatic language, images and even ideologies.So we have created a motive for violence against us through our appalling behaviour toward the Arab world and followers of Islam, and we have created a huge and highly accessible (thanks to the WWW and social media) soft underbelly just asking someone to attack it.Exactly what Abbott and Robb expect Moslem leaders to do about this is unclear.

23 Apr 2015 8:07:26pmsdrwkcab,"Religion is the problem. Evidence based thinking is the answer."Sorry, but I think that this statement is a good illustration of what the REAL problem is.The simple fact is that there is no "answer" - or at least no single "answer", and this is largely because the question keeps changing. It can't help itself. It is part of a dynamic universe. Every time you think that you have found The Answer, turn it over and you will find another question.Sorry if this sounds a bit mystical and wibbly-wobbly, but I am actually basing my comments on what we have learned of Uncertainty, fractal geometry, quantum mechanics and cosmology over the past century. The really pretty thing about all of this is that the application of the evidence-based thinking, scientific method and strict logic to these fields of inquiry has produced a series of "answers" that defy what we have called "common sense" for centuries. It is delightfully ironic that the quest for a firm, immovable foundation for all knowledge and understanding has proven the impossibility of such things while simultaneously revealing the first, tantalising glimpses of a far more wonderful and challenging reality.If you read modern works on cosmology, they often seem to have more in common with Eastern mysticism than with our high-school physics texts. This convergence is the result of the realisation that we have reached a point in our understanding where the logic of Socrates and Aristotle is no longer sufficient.Don't get me wrong - I think that evidence-based thinking is cool, and I am basing this judgement on evidence-based thinking. In fact, I doubt that I could do without it. But don't get carried away - its not the "answer" and nothing can be.

No-they set up a task force.Why do some  Muslim young become radicalised?- Sarah gave a few pointers but in the main for the very same reason all disaffected people do- because for one reason or another they fell they do NOT belong.BTW- I do not know if there is a supreme being or not but I respect those who do- as long as they are not extreme to the level of ISIS or the Inquisitors.

22 Apr 2015 12:25:32pmWhere do you get the eloquent attempt to describe how difficult Muslims find it to control radicalistion? I certainly don't see that message.This article is just one more in the long line of articles which suggest that Islamic extremism is not an Islamic problem. You need twisted logic to try to defend an indefensible claim which is logically contained in the statement. Islamic extremism is an Islamic problem. Extremism is a problem. Islamic extremism is logically an Islamic problem.The problem as I see it lies in the koran. Islamic extremists are not doing anything that is not ordained in the koran. Some might say it has been incorrectly interpreted. Can any Muslim here outwardly say that anything written in the Koran is incorrect and should not apply to today's world? No, because to do so makes them an apostate as dictated by the koran.Ergo, the biggest problem with Islam is the inability to debate and or contest the ideas espoused in it. Islam cannot evolve. It is pure dogma that cannot be modified over time. We treat women differently today than we did even 50 years ago, let alone 1400 years ago. Is Islam able to recognise that? No. Islam is stuck in medieval times and cannot escape.

22 Apr 2015 2:14:41pmthis.the reason articles like the one above skirt the issue that Islamic extremism is an Islamic problem is plain and simple - to recognise that simple fact means facing other facts about Islam and indeed all organised religions - they're based on old fairy tales taken as literal truth to varying degrees by their adherents, so where do you draw the line?!?

22 Apr 2015 6:43:32pmI think if muslims could not debate or contest ideas, or that Islam could not evolve, there would not be the various strands of Islam we see today.I think most muslims do not subscribe to the most extreme teachings in the Quran or they simply could not get along in the modern world with neighbours of differing faiths.  I think our greatest hope lies with moderate muslims who will quietly ditch the nastier parts of their faith, much as christians and jews don't stone people for various crimes described in the Old Testament.  Of course seeing the end of all religious faith would be best.

22 Apr 2015 12:21:22pmFor once I actually agree with you WS. Faith in religion is no different to any adherence to a particular ideology including fanatical regurgitation and approval of conservative LNP propaganda and fossil fuel funded anti-science.What do they all have in common? There is a common cause - a hidden interest in either creating or maintaining power (financial and/or social) and the creation of an entity which people feel like they belong to. People who follow in such a way are just like sheep. They will go with the herd on a given agenda without questioning it, because they want to belong. In the past maybe this benefited mankind in providing some basic rules and principles to live by - and a team to fight for, but I think that we should have evolved from this state by now.Maybe the world does need a global fight to the death to get rid of all of these 'teams', and solve our population problem at the same time.

22 Apr 2015 6:42:57pmWaterloo - on this we can agree. Religion is the problem. What is the Islamic argument against violent jihad? There is no Islamic argument against jihad, because jihad is an Islamic duty. They can argue about the methods but will find no solace in the Koran which can be interpreted easily to justify righteous violence.All cults are structured to disable internal criticism because they're self-referencing ideologies. Religions are cults with many followers. Contradictory evidence is 'haram' (which is why Boko is Haram) and is subservient to the inerrant word of god.Religion is the problem with Islam. As long as people are taught that god is on their side then they will be capable of murdering for god and not feeling like they're doing anything wrong.

The opinions of atheists on any other subject are not bound to coincide. Therefore it's illogical to ask how atheism 'deals with' anything.
Alert moderator
23 Apr 2015 10:17:14pmThanks for that. The issue I have here is understanding anarchy.One point that Sarah Malik is making is that due to the anarchy within Islam it is not possible to fulfil the demands made by Robb that the community leaders impose some sort of control over errant radicals outside their influence.I am curious as to any solutions that atheists, as apparently the primary promoters of anarchist principles, may have to deal with extremism. Again the humans beyond the normal sphere of an atheist's influence.(Personally I subscribe to the notion that individual humans are of infinite value and to kill another human or yourself is morally wrong. Sure allowing someone to die with dignity is an area where a case could be made to provide an exception to the rule.)It doesn't seems fair to make the assertion that religious people should have control over people and at the same time undermine the authority for that control. The other issue is  it is in the public interest to reconnect with those who are alienated. I don't see how mocking gods and religions helps to make a connection with people who have a particularly strong emotional attachment to these particular constructs.Anarchy primarily means respecting people. If we are all anarchists in various degrees how do we  connect to the alienated people? Who, if left to their own devices, will show a great deal of disrespect to people. What's the solution?

23 Apr 2015 7:36:07pmloo,"Once you realise that religion is a construct to control you, you might have a different pint of view."I think that you could have phrased this better.Now, I should point out that I am not a religious person. In fact, you could call me a quiet atheist (as opposed to noisy atheists like Richard Dawkins). But that doesn't stop me from believing that religion tends to get some undeserved "bad press" from time to time.Religion is an essentially personal experience that, at its heart, is a manifestation of a quite natural human desire for security and certainty, and the equally natural human desire to understand what the hell is going on. As westerners, our experience and perception of religion is formed mainly by our interaction with the "Semitic" religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam). These religions have an unfortunate propensity to become the foundations of authoritarian political power.But there are enough examples of authoritarian state power being based on secular ideologies, and of religions that do not easily lend themselves to such perversion, to be able to conclude that the existence of religion is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for the existence of authoritarian political power.The feature that does always seem to accompany authoritarian political power is what I suppose you could call "official ideology" - especially when this ideology is faith based. And it doesn't matter much whether this faith is placed in a mythical all-present, all-seeing, all-powerful God or the mythical "invisible hand" that supposedly guides the equally mythical "free market".

Just like (in recent days) the five teenagers arrested and charged with planning terrorist attacks on ANZAC Day.

Howard and Abbott's anti-civil-liberties laws give enormous discretionary power  to gangs of armed men, while simultaneously protecting them from any form of public or judicial scrutiny. Our security services have been given an effective mandate to wage pogrom on anyone they choose. It could be you, it could be me. They could be acting on firm evidence or the vexacious complaints of a lunatic - either way, we have no right of redress in the event of a mistake or deliberate abuse of power. In effect, Mr Howard and Mr Abbott have given the people whose job it is to protect us the legal ability to commit murder or negligent homicide, to steal and vandalise, to perpetrate brutal home invasions...and if we even raise one word of objection, we can end up in gaol.There has never been an Islamic terrorist attack in Australia, but the actions of our security forces are making this more of a likelihood with every brutal midnight raid their masked goons carry out. THEY and not al Qaeda or ISIS, are by far the greatest threat to our safety and freedom.

22 Apr 2015 10:15:47amWhile not disagreeing with your statistic Amber, muslims are also disproportionally the victims of islamic terrorism if you're looking at it on a global scale.So the impetus is presumably there to contribute to solutions to terrorism.It's pretty amazing that societies look  to their points of difference to create tribal subcultures. Your post refers to muslims as distinct to the rest of us. In islamic cultures, the point of difference is primarily sunni versus shia, just as in the otherwise homogenous Northern Ireland culture so much was and is made of catholic versus protestant.The answer is working with people, not looking at the differences, and the problems invariably reduce to the point of going away. That said, Australian values including respecting the rights of women (to not be married off at age 12 as occurred recently in the case of an Australian-born, anglo-raised muslim father, but also something as simple as the right to wear or not wear a headscarf) need to be clearly encouraged.

23 Apr 2015 1:53:50pmThere are numerically a lot more folks travelling from islam to atheism than the other way around, RMW. Jake Bilardi and the guy who married off his 12 year old daughter are relatively rare examples of people from European backgrounds who converted to islam, they also both went through severe emotional turmoil in their lives prior to finding religion, far from the experience of most Australians of European background. Converts to anything are often inclined to be more zealous than those raised in a religion or culture, this even stereotypically can be seen among those who've quit smoking compared with those who've never smoked. It certainly applied in the cases I've referred to above.

And add in the fact that we don't see muslim fundamentalists murdering folks here without even a second thought, as you put it, and it follows that there aren't many if any of the people you describe actually here.Man Monis was here for nearly two decades and appears to have only become a terrorist at the time of his High Court defeat and conversion to sunni. Numan Haider was an 18 year old who had lived here since boyhood and whose girlfriend had dumped him (and we've seen non-muslim 18 year olds commit suicide by cop in similar circumstances). They were both motivated by their religion but they were just as motivated by emotional turmoil and a sense of victimhood. They were also both disorganised and relatively inneffective, inconsistent with being groomed by terrorist organisations.

The problem is world wide, the religion is exclusively linked to violence and Australian society cherishes everything that many muslim leaders do not. The responsibility rests with you and your sometimes radical religious leaders - not Andrew Robb or any other politician. The responsibility lies with all non radical muslims to ensure their religion is not twisted into hate.

Everyone was united in trying to prevent this type of atrocity from occurring again, they did not criticise the victims and praise the perpetrator.  Australians should be praising our authorities for trying their best, whilst under physical threat from these vile people and verbal abuse from civil libertarians, to keep everyone safe (including the very people who are threatening them).

22 Apr 2015 12:01:52pmSkeptic, can I add to your comment? We need to keep a sense of perspective about threats to our overall security. One of the threats we should be taking a lot of notice of comes from organised groups of extreme nationalists who are taking advantage of events in Australia and abroad. Here's what ASIO said about them in a recent report: "There has been a persistent but small sub-culture of racist and nationalist extremists in Australia, forming groups, fragmenting, re-forming and often fighting amongst themselves. Over the past year, such extremists have been active in protesting against various Muslim interests. Local racist and nationalist extremists maintain links and draw inspiration from like-minded overseas extremists, and much of their rhetoric and activity is derivative, heavily influenced by developments overseas. At present, their main focus is propaganda and engendering support. However, there is always the possibility of a lone actor or autonomous group inspired by a nationalist or racist extremist ideology engaging in violence as a means of provoking a wider response."That's not to downplay threats from religious zealots and others. But extreme nationalist groups generally attempt to take advantage of fear of "outsiders." Over and over you see the same pattern: portray an easily identifiable group as barbaric and alien; verbally and physically attack them; brand anyone who disagrees as extreme left-wing and un-Australian; demand that governments take extreme steps to deal with the outsiders who threaten our Western values and culture; promote the fear that government is not in control and that more authoritarian measures are needed to deal with this threat to our way of life. Fortunately such groups usually spend most of their energies arguing among themselves and are incapable of creating a disciplined organisation that can exercise political power. But everyone should be aware of the ways they go about creating fear and gathering support.

22 Apr 2015 9:41:44am'small but virulent association of extremism'.Not true. 'Extremism' can't be narrowed to murderous ideological acts. Islam is the root cause of the culture of violence, oppression, and backwardness in the of the middle east, and Australians see these behaviours and attitudes developing here too. The social values of even 'moderate' muslims are extreme Right wing by western standards. The most dangerous extremism though is the tribalism that sees Muslims rejects non-Muslims and western life everywhere. 'Whites' tolerate muslims if they integrate and are peaceful and responsible citizens.Here is an example of the problem. Numan Haider launched a murderous attack on police and was shot dead, yet many muslims have a sense of victimhood and paranoia over this. Indeed Haider's father says, 'we still don't know why police killed our son.' Well he should know. See the lack of reflection or self criticism or social responsibility. It always comes down to 'us vs them'. This makes Islam a 'problem'.
Alert moderator
22 Apr 2015 10:55:34amNo, APM. Islam itself is not the 'root cause of the culture of violence, oppression, and backwardness in the of the middle east'- the hijack of the religion by elements seeking to use religion as a mechanism to obtain personal advancement is the cause of the problem.Nature abhors a vacuum. The lack of a hierarchical structure within the Muslim clerical community is what allows theocrats to use religion as a means of obtaining temporal power. Ms Malik doesn't seem to understand that THIS is the reason why western leaders would like to see a hierarchical structure in the Islamic theocracy. A hierarchical structure doesn't take away the radicals (Westboro Baptists, anyone), but what it does is allows radicals to be placed outside of the hierarchy. It enables their exclusion.Shunning is a powerful tool to advocate conformism.

The behaviours behind the violence, oppression and backwardness are not because Islam has been hijacked, they are spelled out in an explicit, detailed, manner within the Koran itself, and anyone who denies or contradicts them is by definition an apostate deserving only death.The violence, oppression and backwardness are pure expressions of Islam, undiluted by the moderating influence of modernity and liberalised Western thought.

For example, as a Muslim you necessarily believe in the existence of an all-powerful supernatural being whose instructions for living were revealed to a bloke in a cave centuries ago. The evidence for these beliefs is poor to non-existent.Yet, when someone challenges you on you beliefs you demand evidence ("name the Muslims" etc) be furnished as though the lack of such evidence being forthcoming will invalidate the claims being made.Evidence of Muslim extremist groups, teachings and actions is readily available. Evidence to support the underpinning supernatural beliefs of Muslims is not.Don't bother countering with comparisons to other religions for such arguments have no relevance. Comparing two false beliefs as though one validates the other is nonsense.

22 Apr 2015 3:02:23pmNot quite, gaznazdiak. People follow football teams out of blind loyalty but they don't all behave badly. Some do, some get tarred with the same brush by association. Not all Bulldogs supporters are thugs (well, I'M not! I hope!)Any system is open to exploitation. Just look at our own superannuation laws. This is one of the failures of Islamic belief- not because of the teachings themselves, but the way the teachings are interpreted.What KMS above you hasn't addressed is the fact that the interpretation of doctrine is similarly prone to hijack. The fact that certain things are written into the Quran doesn't in itself invalidate the whole religion. That's like looking at Christianity through the prism of the Book of Leviticus.The lack of a theocratic hierarchy in Islam is one of the problems. Christianity has been able to evolve (to a point, dictated by conservatives, I will agree) beyond the idea that I should be stoned to death for wearing a cotton/polyester shirt. This has occurred largely because the hierarchy regularly revises and reinterprets orthodoxy. In the absence of this ability to evolve, Islam suffers from the fact that there is no moderating body that influences interpretation. In some respects, however, what I think KMS is getting at is correct, if not well articulated. Going back to the football analogy- it was Bulldogs management and Bulldogs supporters who identified those behind the recent thuggery. They did it because doing so was in the interests of the rest of us 'dogs supporters. If there was a moderating hierarchy in Islamic theocracy, it would curb the excessive interpretations. Self-policing.
Alert moderator
22 Apr 2015 4:27:58pmYes, I see what you're saying.  The problem comes from the requirement to accept that the teachings of the Koran are complete and perfect in their entirety.  They can not be changed, or questioned, only accepted as is, so there is no scope for revision, or moderating, or phasing out of certain disagreeable or contentious sections.  Any attempt to change or question any literal interpretation opens you to the accusation of being an apostate, which carries a death penalty.
Alert moderator
22 Apr 2015 7:36:33pmYes. Similarly, if the Bible was subjected to the same degree of fundamentalist interpretation, crazy Leviticus would have starved half the world because the church wouldn't allow crop rotation. Without a mechanism for orthodox interpretation of doctrine to change to be relevant with the times, the fundamentalism of extreme Islam will continue. Sarah's position in this article seems to be that the lack of a hierarchical structure is a blessing. It is not- it is an abrogation.I also stridently object to the use of the word 'radicalisation' in the context of fundamentalism. We all need MORE Islamic radicalism, not less. We need radicals who will challenge orthodoxy in favour of change- benign change, that influences positive reinterpretation of 'traditional' beliefs.Hundreds of millions of people live in secular orthodox Islamic states, wthout seeking to impose their beliefs or way of life upon others based on a fundamentalist interpretation of their belief structure. In Turkey, secluar muslims stridently oppose the rise of fundamentalism- because they see it for what it is- an attempt by their leaders to become rulers, to maintain power for themselves rather than maintain secular democratic principle. These hundreds of millions of people are an empirical argument that the problem is not the structure of the belief system- it is the manipulation of the system by those seeking to maintain power. It is the idea that sectarian beliefs can be interpreted to maintain control that needs to be opposed, not the basis of those beliefs themselves. Like them or loath them, attack someone's beliefs and you not just make an enemy.The enemy of freedom isn't Islam. The enemy of freedom is fundamentalism, whether it be fundamentalist Islamism, Judaism, Catholocism, whatever.

22 Apr 2015 1:37:24pmGreat, Ann.  So Christianity, Buddhism, Hindu and Greens Left are all religions which appear to be able to stop extremists from their midst from blowing up innocent people or hating our coppers so much they want them dead.  What is it with Islam then?
Alert moderator
22 Apr 2015 2:39:00pmThe answer is simple. If the majority religion of the middle east was Hinduism, then we'd be dealing with Hinduists and Hindu terror. The west has invaded a whole bunch of countries and bombed some more. This explains why you can't find many "problems" of this kind prior to these attacks. Google me wrong

22 Apr 2015 5:09:09pmFro some reason the moderator will not allow me to provide a list of events to demonstrate that Islam has not been a peaceful and pacifist religion, living quietly in the ME until humiliated by unproved attacks by the West.M/s/r Dove asked to be provided with some and I had a huge list. But apparently this is not allowed.Can I have one? Byzantium? Destruction of the last Roman city, after more than a thousand years, and the obliteration of its religion and it culture and conversion of its people and its churches to Islam.

22 Apr 2015 6:30:13pmTabanus - it would be fair to say that EVERYONE was into their massacres in that era - the history of the 1st Crusade contains some particularly nasty examples on all sides.Perhaps your point would be better made looking at some of the tribal areas of what is now Pakistan where pre-imperial history is littered with brutal and murderous behaviour.My point being (I think / guess) is that Islam can be and often is peaceful - anyone who has travelled in SE Asia beyond the tourist-traps will attest to this.   However, to deny that Islam, particularly when mixed with tribal thinking, is not both a risk to Australia and an issue where the primary responsibility for fixing the problem lies with the Islamic community is just silly.

22 Apr 2015 9:44:50amBut it is a problem. And it's a problem we've never had to deal with before from any other religion or ethnic group until recently. The question is who owns the problem? Right now the problem is being framed as a failure of western secular democracies to reach out to and include these young men and somehow prevent their radicalization. It's somehow our problem. Its consequences are certainly our problem to deal with but not its origins. I agree with Andrew Robb. It is a Muslim problem and it's about time they owned it and took greater responsibility for fixing it. Otherwise they will be judged and damned by omission just like Christians are.

Alert moderator
22 Apr 2015 2:03:45pmPerhaps you would like to extend your knowledge on Ireland by reading about it yourself Ann.The conflict in Ireland was not about radicalised youths and did not stem from religion, it arose from the  Anglo/Norman invasions of Ireland in the 12th century and the subsequent displacement and subjugation of the Celts who had already been displaced from England. The subsequent troubles were about sovereignty not about religion. It was fundamentally an Irish/English conflict not a Catholic/Protestant one.

22 Apr 2015 2:57:32pm"Radicalised youths"?Taking someone from their home in front of their family and knee capping them is not radicalised?Blowing up innocent people isn't radicalised?99% of people in Northern Ireland did not care about the Norman invasion. What they wanted to do was get on with their lives. The "radicalised youths" prevented this from happening.

22 Apr 2015 3:16:41pmFGR:Way to miss the point. Atrocities were committed on both sides, as often by middle-aged men as by youths. The point is the conflict was not confined to young men and was fundamentally political not religious, unlike the modern terrorists we are talking about. You don't have the first idea what 99% of people in Northern Ireland cared about, nor apparently, any idea about their history.

22 Apr 2015 4:33:08pmGreat response Orion. I was trying to think of an appropriately worded reply to all those comments about the "Catholic" problem in Ireland, but you've summed up it up well.  I hope posters will read your comment and understand that it applies not just to Ireland\England, but to many conflicts where the root cause is commonly believed to be religion, but is in fact something entirely different. Religion is usually a factor of convenience, or a co-incidental commonality among a group of marginalised or oppressed people. As long as we keep blaming religion, we will fail to see the root cause. And by failing to identify the cause, we cannot resolve the problem.
Alert moderator
22 Apr 2015 5:08:07pmBystander I think Orion was trying to distinguish one bunch of murdering thugs from another.He or she believes that Northern Ireland was entirely different. You see it was political or about nationalism not any of this religion malarky. So it more than justified all the brutal killings. Not like the modern breed of terrorist. Apparently they are only doing it for religious reasons. Nationalsim is just another form of ideology. What ISIS have done is combine religion and nationalism. That's two times the crazy.
Alert moderator
23 Apr 2015 11:31:47amI was trying to point out, just as Bystander says, that the conflict in Ireland is often blamed on religion when that's not what it was about. Neither side claimed to act in the name of their religion and their targets were political or military. The modern phenomenon of Islamist terrorism, on the other hand, is very much about religion at least to them. They do not separate church and state as we do, their religion, their nation, their law and their identity is Islam. Their ultimate goal is a global Islamic state. That is different to previous versions of terrorists who have been overwhelmingly political in their ideology and objectives, for instance, the European anarchists. I am not justifying anybody's killing.

22 Apr 2015 4:17:41pmAnn Thank you all the same but being of Irish descent I think I've got a pretty good handle on the "troubles". When the Irish came to Australia they were glad to get away from the place and were thankful for a new start in a new country and just got on with forging new lives. Except for "blackening each other's hearts" as Manning Clark described it there was little or no actual sectarian violence and not many if any bothered going back to the old country or to any other country to get even with the other side for real or perceived transgressions.

22 Apr 2015 2:09:52pmThe whole "muslim owning the problem" thing is spectacularly self-defeating.Every time Imams are asked to condemn a particular horrific act it actually helps ISIS. Because:1. it isolates the muslim community (which is what ISIS is trying to do);2. confirms that the Imams are out of touch with the extremists (which is what ISIS is saying).The whole thing is that they are rebelling. Rebelling agains society, their parents and the Imams. So rolling out an Imam every single time is completely self-defeating.Instead rather than falling for a pretty obvious ploy, we should be standing united with muslims and sending the message that the muslims are part of the Australian community and this requires Australia to take "ownership of the problem".
Alert moderator
22 Apr 2015 3:16:17pm1. So ISIS is that powerful it can isolate an estimated world-wide population of 1.6 billion peace loving people?2. Why would any Allah fearing Imam want to be in touch with these extremists?Every generation rebels against the previous one in some way small or large. I would suggest going to a foreign country and chopping off the head of your enemy and posing on social media holding it up goes a little beyond rebellion. That's probably more rightly classified as an atrocious act of barbarity. I am more than prepared to stand alongside any peace loving Muslim as most Australians would be. They know what we stand for but it would be good to hear from them that they stand for the same things. Mostly I hear silence or excuses so it's no wonder they are easy pickings for ISIS.

22 Apr 2015 4:00:50pmISIS is not that powerful but when people say it's a "muslim problem" it plays directly into their hands.And yes clearly they're doing more than just rebelling but it seems to be a very important part of the recruitment.There is such a thing as propaganda.

22 Apr 2015 4:47:48pmSo I get it, it's an Australian or a problem for western society. How is it then when the west tries to intervene to prevent bloodshed and slaughter it is seen as an incitement to generate even more terrorism not only in the region but on our shores.Personally I would withdraw all our western troops and let them slaughter each other. That seems to be what they want and what makes them happy. It was a huge mistake to ever get involved in their affairs.
Alert moderator
22 Apr 2015 7:14:06pmThe problem with that is it's too late. We cannot undo the past. But the thing about making it "our problem"/an "Australian problem" is that we are in control. We cannot control a bunch of lunatics going off to kill themselves and other people in the Middle East but we can control how we respond. And the way we respond is not to escalate matters by blaming certain groups in society and by making generalisations. We respond with a collectively. We condemn the atrocities as a nation not by turning on one group and telling them to deal with it. We ask for the whole of society to be vigilant and to work together to identify threats. We do not give up our freedoms.We ask the police to work with the community and build trust.We work with teachers and health workers to identify and help mental illness.We give young people hope. Hope that one day they will get jobs and have a purpose.    And most importantly we start to address what exactly happened 12 years ago when this country invaded another country without any legal mandate based on non-existent evidence. We control that narrative. We own up to those failings and we acknowledge the damage we did. And the reason we do that? Because we are the good guys and good guys know the difference between right and wrong.This way we own the narrative not ISIS.

22 Apr 2015 9:50:31amHi Sarah.  I was pleased to see this article.  It is an absolute disgrace that any one religion should be singled out, particularly since it is an obvious political ploy to keep the population threatened and therefore reluctant to change leaders.I think it is disgusting that so many people are tarred with the one brush when many of them have been living here for decades with no aggressive and radical leanings.  Where I live there is a well integrated Turkish (Muslim) origin population group for example, along with many other races, and they have lived here for several generations.  They have contributed meaningfully to the local economy and community.  Some choose to wear headgear, others not, but no one really notices or bothers about it, except the lower achievers looking for excuses for their own shortcomings.The more this issue is fomented, the more people will become marginalised and disaffected.  Kind regards.
Alert moderator
22 Apr 2015 10:33:24amWhile I generally agree with most of what you say, I must pull you up on one point.Nobody is singling out any one religion.  Members of one religion are pushing themselves forward, seeking recognition.  It is not as though a wave of Methodists, Buddhists, Catholics and Muslims are carrying out terror attacks, and the media are only reporting those involving Muslims.There are people claiming that to be a true Muslim one must attack the non-believers.  That it is the duty of a true Muslim to spread Islam by the sword, as it was in the days of the Prophet and his immediate followers.Now I do not believe that most Muslims think this is what their religion demands.  But they seem very reluctant to demonstrate publicly that this is the case.Demonstrations are held when an unknown US preacher threatens to burn a Koran.  Where were the crowds pouring out of mosques protesting about the murders of cartoonists?  Where the mass protests about the kidnapping and slavery of young women in the name of Islam?It is this lack of condemnation of their co-religionists that is the source of much unhappiness and suspicion.  Many Muslims seem more upset about one old lady abusing a couple on a train than about policemen being knifed.  Even when there is public statement made by a "leader", it is often hedged with criticisms of the victims or the society that has welcomed Moslems and provided them with conditions and freedoms never experienced in any Muslim rule state, including the almost mythical Al Andulas.To avoid more criticism, Muslims must acknowledge that the problem is not the media, not "racism", not that they are victims,  It is those who follow Islam in a form that society cannot accept.
Alert moderator
22 Apr 2015 12:22:39pm@ Tabanusit's an interesting viewpoint.  I wonder firstly how much protest there is against "those who follow Islam in a form that society cannot accept" which the media just doesn't cover and therefore you and I don't know it's happening.  To be fair, it may occur and it's just not reported - it would be interesting to hear whether it actually occurs or whether there is a complete vacuum as you suggest.I have to say the appeal Sarah suggests about Sunni Islam is clearly also it's biggest issue.  Lack of organised leadership really hurts its ability to combat issues such as extremism.  There does not seem to be the same numbers of people coming out against extremism as for it - that to me is the fundamental issue.  People appear to quietly disagree with extremism, but do not go as far as to be outraged by it.  There seems to be a quiet understanding of it - whether that is a media concoction or not is the issue.  There is little to no visibility of Sunnis coming out condemning specific Sunni groups for their support of extremism, the default understanding of other members of the public therefore is that they must support it.  Is this fair?  Probably not.  But its the price you pay for sitting back and saying nothing while others hijack your religion.  There seems to be a level of fire the Islamic community can present when it feels it is being discriminated against as a whole, but it doesn't appear to be able to tap into that fire to deal with internal issues or put away the sects that seem to be the most poisonous to society.

22 Apr 2015 12:49:51pmSorry to contradict you Tabanus, but a number of people are singling out persons of the Muslim faith.  We have politicians telling Muslim Leaders the ball is in their court in relation to radicalisation.  Recently a couple with a small child were vilified on a bus and are now terrified to use public transport.A number of prominent Muslim followers have made comments distancing themselves from the incidents to which they refer.I find that people of the Muslim faith tend to be quiet, modest and pacifist.  I also find that religious extremism is not confined to any one religion, and would like to mention the many "Christians" in Middle America.  Some of the documentaries on their way of life show them as extremist and reactionary.

22 Apr 2015 12:59:18pmI agree with you, and think you have summed up how many feel very well. Also, basic human nature comes into it. Say I'm a feminist and wear a t-shirt that says "I'm a feminist". Now say around the world there are terror cells of nutty feminists chopping the heads off people, blowing things up, and trying to destroy society. I would no doubt get some backlash about being a feminist, even though I may be disgusted by the actions of the few. Not fair, but human nature.And, this article is complaining about Robb and his response to the 'Muslim problem". The fact is if there wasn't these nutso terrorists and their supporters around the world there would be no 'muslim problem' for him to be banging on about.As is often pointed out, no-one cares about Buddhists in Australia.

22 Apr 2015 11:00:05amAll religions teach delusion. All religions may rightly be criticised as human constructs, the product of ignorance, superstition or fear, or as a mechanism to control others, or a combination of those elements.Islam may be rightly criticised for being the premier religion used to justify terrorist acts in recent history. There is no possible way that a case can be put to contradict this.It is nonsensical to point to religious barbarism of centuries ago as if this mitigates the acts of contemporary religious extremists. From an atheist point of view this kind of argument is doubly contemptible.Other, more "mature" religions have been through reformative processes as their grip on modern society has dwindled. This has caused a re-interpretation (for example) of the homophobic, xenophobic, misogynistic passages of the bible by modern Christians.Until Islam undergoes its own reformation and re-interpretation to fit the modern world, and until that reformation is accepted and spread by the leaders of Islamic nations and Islamic communities, nothing is going to change.

Differences and discrimination stemmed from religion but essentially it became more of a (perceived) social injustice issue. And I do not think the IRA ever, ever claimed to inflict anything upon their enemies in the name of their God (unlike Islam) - they did so for other reasons, with the underlying religious differences being almost moot.

23 Apr 2015 12:06:48pmThe Irish were fighting for centuries for independence and self-rule against the English who had subjugated them by military force and against the "planters" who had been imported to Ireland from England and Scotland and given vast land grants as rewards by the English crown. It had nothing to do with religion. Protestants did not exist in Ireland until the 16th century. The Irish revolution and the later "troubles" of the 20th century were between nationalists (wanting a unified Irish republic) and unionists (wanting Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK). The unionists were mostly protestants because, unlike in the rest of Ireland, most of the population of Northern Ireland were Protestants.

I might add that there is no lack if Muslim "leaders" fronting the media to claim "This (insert latest outrage has nothing to do with Islam".  If these "leaders" have no authority, why are their statements to be believed more than to those carrying out the various murders, attacks etc who unanimously claim that it is all about Islam? May I suggest that these leaders, instead of trying to convince me, try to convince their co-religionists?

22 Apr 2015 9:57:30amThe problems we face are extremely complex with no simple answers. Thus our politicians are caught between their ideology and their real beliefs. We have set the agenda as a nation. We went to war in Iran and killed the person that was keeping a lid on these age old conflicts that we know little about and have no understanding of feudal conflicts spanning generations.Now we treat people escaping from the chaos we unleashed as criminals and lock them up.  These refugees share our principles and want to escape -but we stand fast to our racial prejudices and put them in harms way.You now have a group of young men that have religious beliefs that are conflicted by our behavior. We contend we are of an ANZAC heritage and give the next bloke a fair go. We no longer do that yet we celebrate those ideals as though they are still part of our culture. Those young men hear the conversations at home. There are many correct and frustrated families that complain and beguile the way Australia treats their heritage (read religion). These young men are like all young men -they have not had their passion for principles destroyed. They want to set this "wrong" to be "right".When we say the community needs to support them - that is bleeding obvious. The complexity is in trying to explain that Australia is not a principled place anymore, BUT it is the best place to live in the entire world.  The cost of living here is to forgo your principles, tolerate ignorance and jingoism -because outside our haven called Australia the world is in deed a place of even greater conflict with no solutions upon the horizon.

22 Apr 2015 10:17:06amI can only add to the clear general theme in the comments posted thus far. Islam does present as a problem. Religion per se is not a problem. However, Islam is much more than just a religion. It is a political ideology that has at its roots intolerance and violence. The separation of state and religion is fundamental to our social systems. We do not have this in absolute terms as many still see us as a Christian society, which I think is also a problem, but nonetheless we do hold the separation as an ideal that needs to be followed. Islam is the antithesis of this principle. Therein lies the biggest problem with Islam.

However, I stop short of saying that it needs to be cast aside as that sounds like banning religion to me- which I would not support. If someone wants to go to church and worship mythical beings then that is fine- so long as it does not enter into our political and legal doctrines.

22 Apr 2015 1:18:06pm'so long as it does not enter into our political and legal doctrines'But it does....from the simple act of the Lords prayer in parliament to a Prime Minister seeking advice from Cardinal Pell.Also, I am not for banning it. I am just for calling it for what it is. I believe once that is properly done, no sane person would give it a second thought.

22 Apr 2015 1:43:05pmI totally agree sdrawkcab, there should be no place for the Lord's prayer or any other religious doctrine in our political and legal system. Nobody should be asked to swear on a bible about anything for example too. That is a meaningless gesture to me and many others too. That is what I meant when I said it remains a problem in our system.

22 Apr 2015 10:21:26amExhortations to muslim clerics have a place because there is an incompatibility between Islamic teachings and modern secular societies.  Modern secular states relegate religion to being a private matter whereas Islam dictates how you dress, what you drink and what you eat. It even enters politics with many adherents believing in a caliphate.  There will be much less issues if Islam in Australia was to modernise and restrict itself to matter spiritual. Muslims need to be able to integrate with the general secular society taking part in activities that normal Australians do such as going to night clubs etc.  When muslims put up submissions such as having sharia law or having separate beaches then these are clear signs is that muslims are a society apart. This estranges muslims and makes them prone to jihadist propaganda. The solution lies within Islam in Australia. The imams are the only ones who can make this happen.

22 Apr 2015 1:29:53pmDove;  Indeed the same criticism can be levelled against any group that seeks to isolate its members from society whether they are Jews, Breathren or any other Christian cult.  It is a criticism against the clergy who seek to impose these constraints.  It is they who need to accept that a 21st Century secular society is at odds with those who demand their adherents make a conspicuous display of their membership of that group and its difference to the rest in society.

22 Apr 2015 2:22:24pmYou don't care to make a distinction between "the fringe of the fringe" and the overwhelming majority when it comes to Muslims, whereas you just made that same distinction for the groups you don't, or dare not hate: Jews and the Brethren. That is two sets of standards
Alert moderator
22 Apr 2015 3:43:30pmI disagree, Coogara, because there are a lot of issues attributed to muslims in general that are not reflective of muslims as a whole. The squeaky wheel gets the most oil. The reason we only hear about 'bad' muslims is because, just like Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Confucianists and RPG-gamers, most just go about their business. The argument that there is an 'between Islamic teachings and modern secular societies' decries the fact that there are a number of modern secular Islamic societies where religion plays quite a limited role. Compare Indonesia, Malaysia, and until recently Turkey and the role of religion there and then look at the role of religion in the US- then tell me there is much difference in influence.As I have said elsewhere, however- the lack of an Islamic theocratic hierarchy works against the integration of temporal and theocratic power. 'Modernisation' of the Catholic church, for example, is driven by regular meetings of church leaders. No- the role of modernization is not as swift as secular people would like, but at least the church has managed to move on a large number of issues. Islam could use a moderating body as a way of demonstrably pushing radical elements to the fringe. We would then all be free to see that the fundamentalists are as much a fringe element of Islam as the Westboro church is a fringe of Christianity.

22 Apr 2015 10:21:51amWe are tackling the symptoms and not the disease. A Saudi-Iran (Sunni-Shia) war has been simmering away for decades. The boil over has been al Qaeda and ISIL, Sunni jihadists, armed and funded by Saudi Arabia, have been set upon the Assad regime in Syria with tacit US, Israeli and Western acceptance in furtherance of the own Middle East political aims, all the while their leaders mouth meaningless condemnations of al Qaeda. Senior US officials have been admitting for some time now that Saudi Arabia and other Sunni states, our allies in the "war on terror," have been providing "thousands of tons of arms" and "millions of dollars" to ISIL in a vast political contradiction that our media dances around.Just a few days ago the Los Angeles Times openly admitted that the Saudi attacks in Yemen (done with US weaponry and intelligence) were directed against Iranian-backed Houthis and none of it against al Qaeda forces there who have been able to conduct a $1-million bank heist, a prison break of scores of their colleagues and the capture of a military base -- all while Saudi Arabia and the US stand idle! The political contradictions could never be more stark. The US is backing al Qaeda in Yemen!Perhaps Andrew Robb could ignore local public confusion over Muslim issues and recall our 300 troops and fighter aircraft from Iraq until he can work out exactly who the hell we are supposed to be fighting and why.

22 Apr 2015 11:44:38pmSpeculating here, doesn't everyone? I don't think Boko Haram is that relevant here except as part of the background landscape. The issue here is that when the Prime Minister made the " Baddies versus baddies" comment, it referred to the conflict between shia and sunni sides in Syria. I presume Abbott was supporting Obama against the group supported by Putin and the Pope. Fortunately diplomacy won the day. It seems highly probable that if Obama had bombed the other group then; we would be fighting  alongside ISIS now. Getting involved in other peoples wars, in any wars at all, doesn't make any sense to me.No need to find fault. Stop the Hate.

22 Apr 2015 10:25:53amI certainly don't get the messages that the author attributes to Robb and others.  For a start, I don't believe any half reasonable person in Australia (and despite Malik's views and unfortunately those of many other ABC contributors and journos, that includes Robb and the vast bulk of Liberals in general) attributes this problem to Muslims generally.  However, it is a simple fact that budding terrorist recruits mostly feel alienated from society; as many young people do.  That feeling of alienation is exploited by others who in effect offer them a form of Islam that makes them feel both part of something and elevated above the society that they blame for their feelings of alienation.  It could be exploited by someone offering them drugs as a form of escapism, or a gang or bikie group wanting someone to support their criminal activities, or another religious sect, or indeed a huge array of entities waiting to exploit human vulnerability.The point is, how to tackle this problem generally and in the terrorist case in particular.  Now if a person is taken into a group and effectively feels a protected part of that group, then an outsider that tries to break that bond will very likely fail; they are after all, the "enemy".  So in this case, short of physically removing the person from the evil influences, no infidel or infidel initiated action will stand much of a chance.In a broader sense, that leaves other Muslims; the very point Robb and others make.  That the author simply ignores that fact and in effect seeks to demonise the people who make that point with her own dog-whistling to those who wish to think the right is dominated by evil, racist, dog-whistling bigots exposes her own failings in that regard and should give pause for thought.

This goes to the disaffected commentary as well.The concept of alienation implies that these people want to be part of society. That is where I disagree with you. These people are part of our society and they are rejecting it. They are appeased by the medieval trappings of islam and its simplistic view of the world. Life is too easy in our society. These people want a struggle and a fight to justify their existence. Islam, and this version of Islam in particular, provides these people with a reason for being that is simplistic in message and condones a life of violence and struggle against others.

22 Apr 2015 10:26:49am"One of the great attractions of Sunni Islam is the lack of hierarchical or mediating priest-class, with a focus on the individual's direct relationship to God.Sure there are imams who lead prayer, and scholars who have spent years nutting out points of law, and an axis of orthodoxy most mainstream leaders are guided by. Beyond that, leaders are made more by their following and popularity rather than anointed by overarching councils or bodies"So, having gone to great lengths to explain that this is a major point of difference between Islam and other religions, and then accepting that cells of nut-job adherents will, as a matter of course, self-select nut-job "leaders" who then further whip up and reinforce the nut-jobbery already flying around, would Ms Malik be good enough to explain to me exactly why this ISN'T a "Muslim problem" (and ONLY a "Muslim problem")?What I've just read suggests everything to the contrary - if your processes were like other religions I may be compelled to think otherwise.

Alert moderator
22 Apr 2015 1:11:14pmI'd argue that there is at least the perception, if not the actuality, that by espousing the lack of a hierarchical structure within Islam as A Good Thing, those not attracted to the 'thousand flowers blooming' approach get justifiably upset when moderate Islamists justify the abrogation of responsibility for managing their more radical elements on the basis that 'we LIKE not having a hierarchy'.Regardless of what you might LIKE, Sarah, the point is that as a society evolves, hierarchies of authority evolve with that society. This does not have to be about a mechanism of control. For example, we have police to support laws that are generally arrived at through the consensus process of democratic representation. The existence of a police force does therefore not in itself imply a societal control. What it DOES represent is an acceptance of the need to manage societal conformity with agreed standards of behavior for the good of that society.  There is at least the perception that the lack of Islamist theocratic hierarchies is more about a justification for inaction to police that level of societal conformity. The upshot of your argument, Sarah, is that by choosing not to have 'police' might give you freedom to do what you want, its a bit rich to complain that those who WANT police are sick of the break-ins and dislike you for not letting THEM have police.As a (former) farmer, I'll put it in simpler terms. Even a sheep knows not to crap where it eats, because there are consequences to that sort of behaviour.

22 Apr 2015 2:15:51pmWorth reading "Slavery, Terrorism and Islam" by Peter Hammond for his political theory on Muslim population vs success of society. 100% saturation of Islamic cultures (Somalia, Yemen, Afghanistan) are the most failed regimes in the world. 2% or less nations (USA, Norway, Australia) are amongst the best. Hammond postulates that once a countries Muslim population exceeds 2% the society starts to degrade as a result of the amount of Muslims in that society. Sharia Law becomes inevitable as first Halal is instituted, and that in turn creates an Apartheid Industry where only Muslims can get jobs. As Sharia moves into the streets we see Muslim Patrols (similar to the Vice police of Saudi Arabia), Muslim courts that usurp the rule of Common Law and the rise of Extremist and Terror groups and Individuals. Language is strictly policed, particularly criticism of which Islam has zero tolerance and in fact requires death to the infidel for this heinous act (Charlie Hebdo). interesting political theory anyway and definitely borne out by the statistics at the moment.

And if so what would that change bring.While I doubt that 2% is anything like the figure required, already we see Muslim groups pushing for changes.  My local swimming pool is now closed to men at certain times.  Laws are amended to cope with facial coverings.  A small start, but the Muslim minority is quite vociferous and demanding.  Far more than say the Buddhists or the Jains.We have already seen police forces and local councils cowed into ignoring anti-social and criminal behaviour both here and in France and Britain, for fear of upsetting pressure groups. The exploitation of young girls in Bradford and the attacks on beach goers in Cronulla were both condoned by local authorities, too scared of being called "racist'.What makes you think it would stop there?

The Pakistanis don't hang out with the Egyptians. They literally speak different languages. They have their own mosques. They follow different schools of Islam (that's a denomination to you). Their lives don't cross. Like Australians in Earl's Court, they much prefer to stick to the people they know. When they meet, they use English. That's their common denominator.

They share a common faith in Jesus and the same basic articles of faith, but their race, ethnicity, language and politics divides them just as much as their difference in the rites of worship and scriptural emphasis. It's only with some imagination that you can compare Anglicanism, Mormonism and Rastafarianism. This is so obvious that you'd have to put in real effort to miss it.

22 Apr 2015 10:40:51am"One of the great attractions of Sunni Islam is the lack of hierarchical or mediating priest-class, with a focus on the individual's direct relationship to God."That sounds wonderful at first glance but ultimately it is just simplistic when considering the ramifications,. in my opinion.   It seems to be not dissimilar to the Baptists and like 'reformed' or 'evangelical' religeous groups in Christianity. They too have turned out to produce the most arrogant and self righteous thugs who readily use an assertion of divine inspiration to justify actions which when you step back could only reasonably be Satan's work. Almighty God has after all commanded 'thou shalt not kill'. I don't imagine he considers torture, beating, enslavement and other brutalities visited on his 'children' by their brethren ( as we all are in His eyes) too lightly either.Burning alleged witches and 'heretics' is not much different from stoning rape victims to death, beheading 'infidels' or 'non believers' on down to selling shoolchildren into sexual slavery. BTW, how a notional 'christian' or Jew for that matter could be called a 'non believer' is utterly beyond my God given intelligence to comprehend.Your lack of hierarchy Sarah, means an unregulated religious ideology where every nutjob who expresses his or her fidelity to God can justify all sorts of utterly disgusting brutality and claim it is all in the name of God. That is what is happening with the Taliban, Al Quaeda, ISIS and all the little nutjob narcissist 'imams' scattered through the muslim community with their 'prayer' halls and flocks of teenage pets being groomed for a 'jihad' of their own confection. That is at the worst end of the scale. Further down the line it helps give voice to weasel words to not condemn such behaviour, to wring ones hands and 'understand the reasons' or even very carefully, greasily but unmistakably justify or express approval for such actions.While the Roman Catholics are no exemplar of 'christian' purity as a centralised, hierarchical system, it is some centuries since they behaved anything like some 'muslim' groups do today. The fundamental problem with religious ideology Sarah, this is I suppose a consequence of us being 'cast out' from Eden, is that our God given intelligence cannot prove it and it not uncommonly gets extrapolated to the point  where it is  utterly at odds with what said God given intelligence would suggest or conclude as being proper or in any way rational.All that said, the inspired thoughts of the prophets are not to be ignored. The one I think gives  the best value for effort comes from the prophet Jesus Christ:- "Do unto othersWhat you would have othersdo unto yourself"(It even works as a haiku with some fineagling of the syllable count)Sarah, your religion is your business as mine is mine. I would readily wish you Happy Eid as you mig

22 Apr 2015 12:10:16pmI believe all religions to be fanciful and unattractive. There is no god, although I will happily use the term metaphorically.Sarah says this lack of hierarchy is a great attraction of Sunni Islam. Ultimately we need to look at why people are attracted to religion at all. It appears to me that the only real attraction that is common to all religions is the seemingly common inability of humans to accept that we are just a biological entity that comes and goes with no real purpose.

22 Apr 2015 2:25:17pm"Ultimately we need to look at why people are attracted to religion at all"Religions propagate via an inheritance mechanism whereby already indoctrinated people perform mind control on the next generation at the very stage when these young minds are being formed.Strictly speaking, for the vast number of "religious" people they weren't ever in a position to be "attracted" to it - they were led there and chained to it when they lacked the wherewithal to analyse what was being done to them.With the passage of time they rationalise their captivity and, given enough time, start coming around and banging on your door to offer you pamphlets about timeshare with them in their prison as a way of Hoovering-up any who may have missed the indoctrination class.Prevent any form of adult interference in a child's spiritual development and mandate that no religious affiliations can be entered into until you reach the age of consent, and you can smash the power of this crap in a generation. The currency and credibility religions currently enjoy is, at core, underpinned by an abuse of children.

22 Apr 2015 10:07:06pmIf we are merely biological entities, presumably our sole purpose is to ensure the survival of our own species, as an incidental by-blow of our drive to ensure the continuation of our individual DNA. So, forgive the nastiness inherent in the suggestion, if I decide that the best way for me to do this is to breed with your 12-year old daughter, is it OK for me to do this by force?  Particularly if I'my more powerful than her parents. Or do you have some pointless non-biological myth that says this is a bad idea? Do let us know.

23 Apr 2015 2:49:21pmNot sure how your point has anything to do with fear of mortality which is the driver of all religions. Yes we are biological entities and yes we have a desire (not purpose) to procreate. We have built social mores around what is acceptable or not and in my world what you describe is not appropriate conduct.

22 Apr 2015 12:46:11pmUrsus, as you yourself have noted, Islam is NOT the only religion to have a thousand break-off groups claiming to be the best and true one.It happens to all of them, so this aspect of Islam is not the "magic ingredient" that is making it a "violent, extremist" religion.Please consider that *every* major terrorist group in recent history has had funding or weapons or training given to them by the USA at one point or another.That is the key factor in their success, not religion.

22 Apr 2015 10:46:05amThe west (that's us) have been involved in multiple wars across the middles east for fifteen years. To prevent anti-war movements at home we need to have an enemy to hate. And what do middle eastern countries all have in common? Entre a government instigated and media propagated campaign. Anyone we didn't like used to be called "communists". This is nothing new. Google some anti Islamic headlines from 1999 and 2000 prove me wrong. But forget trying to counter it with logic, because there is none. The people most easily swayed by such campaigns can easily be convinced that sharia is creeping and halal is seeping into our lives. The simple minded, the aged, the racist and the ignorant are ever so easily convinced to feel fear and threatened by a their own shadows. Islamophobia, the acceptable face of racism works backward from it's desired end point of hatred and violence. It does this by cherry picking, omitting and carefully selecting factoids, refusing to apply the same standards to themselves and then inciting hatred and violence in others. It's a tactic as old a Methusela. I've read on, The Drum, calls for Australian Muslims to be interned, deported, castrated and killed. Do explore non-moderated sites that specialise in this pursuit. But the feeble brained aren't totally to blame, as they've never met a Muslim, much less asked one what they believe, what their views are, how they define themselves or what are the important parts of their identity. They've never sat down in a Mosque and listened to a sermon. They instead read the tabloids (principally for the form guide) and watch the endless stream of uncorrected half truths on the tellie which is only interested in keeping their attention long enough to get to the next ad break. At best they've thumbed through the Qu'ran and absorbed more of it than they did of Deuteronomy or Leviticus but remain unwilling to make the only conclusion. So here's the test: how's your so-called freedom of speech were the same campaign to be launched against Jews. How does anti-semetism work as a form of racism? What would be your position were the same things were said of Muslims, said of Jews. I would have used Indigenous Australians as an example, but the hatred of them, and Muslims, overlaps too much- you most commonly see one with the other

If I'm right, all the commentators who say "it's only Islamics who carry out acts of terror" are, I submit, letting their own preconceptions get in the way. The spate of raids and arrests we have seen lately does not prove guilt - only that the authorities are publicising their vigilance. It's undeniable that there are nutcases within modern Islam, Sunni and Shia, who have an axe to grind against, apparently, everyone; but we we won't help by ramming our fear of them down the throats of those Islamic people who are living peacefully among us. The bigger, and so far unasked, question is how we settle the divergences between Islamic practice and secular Australia, because deep differences DO exist, and we can't even begin to sort it out while our Government is telling us to be afraid, be VERY afraid.

22 Apr 2015 11:10:22amIs it so hard to understand why young Muslim men living in Australia would want to go and fight in the Middle East?As in many things history may be a helpful guide. If we go back a hundred years we had thousands of young Australian men leaving Australia to go and fight in the Middle East and on the Western Front in Europe. Why? Because  the British Empire was at war and they felt a sense of fellow feeling with the British. Many Australian servicemen were either born in Britain themselves and had migrated to Australia before the War or had parents or grandparents who had been born in Britain. So when World War One broke out they understandably identified with the British Empire, they answered the call and went off to help.Many young Muslim men were either born in the Middle East or their parents or grandparents were so not surprisingly they have a sense of fellow feeling for people living in the Middle East. Many such young men see the Middle East as being under attack from the West. We in the West may not see it like that but they do. So is it really so hard to understand why this is happening?

22 Apr 2015 11:16:05amExcellent and considered article. However as with many of these articles, good and bad, there sits problems that for western politicians that are out of bounds for learned discussion. Why is this? Simply because it seems to be an accepted parameter that western nations (Christian) can interfere in the politics of specific Middle Eastern (and North African) nations (mostly Muslim) with some god given immunity and not expect some backlash to occur at some time. The new gunboat style diplomacy is a reflection of something that is undefinable at present other than perhaps an ego to control things for no certain reason. A small hint to the writer. As a writer of non fiction on specific items from Muslim and Hindu countries I work on a daily basis with many religions. I stand by and with them all. However when someone actually is prepared to stand up and support specific Muslim communities who have recently been subjected to vilification or mosque burning (for example) it would be nice to at least once see some recognition such as a reply to an email or a return of a phone call. This does not seem to happen. The organisation of the Sunni branch has nothing to do with this because there are community "leaders" and organisations that can be found on the internet to contact.A lack of response to such messages of support is at best plain bad manners at worst it is something quite different. Think about it.

22 Apr 2015 11:20:52amThe Muslim community world wide is failing in their duty of care to people of others faiths. It is simple as that.Every time a member of that community commits murder in the name of their religion from the Spanish train atrocities, to the murder in Britain of a soldier with knives they betray the trust of the rest of us.As has been pointed out so many times it is ridiculous no other faith has this problem at this point in time. Just recently there has been the mass murder of Christians in Libya and then again in Kenya. If the world Muslim communities are so obviously incapable of preventing their own believers from committing these crimes then the rest of us have to take action to prevent it. We have Muslims committing these hideous crimes EVERY DAY. What on Earth do you honestly expect the rest of the human race to do?I sympathize that the writer of the article feels like an outsider, if her community continues in their hopelessly inadequate response to the problem she can only expect that feeling to get a lot worse as time goes on.

22 Apr 2015 11:21:17amThe wider Australian population has its fair share of problems but it's obvious that the muslim population is overrepresented in many of those areas.The answer isn't for everyone else to whip themselves harder and hug muslims to make their problems go away. When it comes to social criticism the wider population is far more self-conscious. I think we self-flagellate over our redneck behaviours far more than the muslim population does over theirs.The muslim community has problems and the wider community has limited influence. So muslims are in the best position to achieve something. Putting them beyond criticism while criticising everyone else for their problems is impotent nonsense. People who promote that strategy clearly aren't interested in problem solving they're just in love with their own agenda. Robb is absolutely right.

Religion is on the way out (according to ABS statistics) and we need a leader who is representative of the majority - rather than having a leader who is dangerously confrontational in defending his own personal religious agenda.

No one single person in Australia owes you anything because you have decided to believe one set of stories over another.

22 Apr 2015 11:56:05am"Like most young people, not just Muslims, traditional religious authorities (read: old people) have failed to connect with the millennials' quest for meaning in a changing social media world."That's a compelling case for the dismantling of religious and culturally exclusive schools. We can expect a child's after school and home-life activities to be largely monocultural because it represents the decisions of the parents and reflects the cultural mix of freinds and family. More recent arrivals are more likely to have less of a cultural mix in terms of family and friends. It's only natural that it is so and there's nothing wrong with that.Of the migrants and refugees that came to Australia between the 1950s and early 1980s, the vast majority of them sent their children to multicultural state schools. It was there that the students learned about, dealt with and appreciated subtle differences in background. The schools provided a source of multicultural experience that the students weren't getting anywhere else. I'm not talking about the homogenised, filtered, discussion of differences that might today sound popular with school administrators and managers, but instead the unmediated life experience 'in the playground' as it were. It is here where students pick up the idea that cultural differences don't really add up to much in the multicultural society. Whether the surname is Smith, Nguyen, Khadid, Delgado, Kamboukos or Gryzawski, it doesn't matter. He or she is just another kid who can catch a ball, can tell good jokes, is good at athletics, or is a demon on the monkey bars.Denying children in the multicultural society this particular experience increases the likelihood that the student develops problematic attitudes towards 'others'.

You will almost never see it with any other ideology, even the more popular ones.This is why Islam is specifically a problem, not islamic people, not dark people, but the ideology itself.  I agree targetting the above issues will help reduce radicalisation, but to state that Islam is an inocent bystander is disingenuous and anyone that peddles it is either ignorant or in denial.

Then complain about being a Muslim in a non Muslim country and compare the experiences between the two if you are lucky enough to live to tell the tale in some of those countries. Of course Islam isn't the problem is it, it is always something else. The religion of peace and tolerance hardly peaceful and rarely if ever tolerant of criticism as we have seen.

22 Apr 2015 12:29:03pm2 things here:1) The federal government are not helping in this issue. The language they are using is not helping, they are responding to radicalism with a radicalism of their own, and IMHO I think this is being picked up and reflected in certain sections of the community. They need to be more measured, nuanced and mature in their conversation about this. They need to help to calm things down, not come out swinging like they have.2) Muslim Leaders need to speak out against radicalism - and they need to do it publicly - not just from the pulpit on Fridays, but within the public sphere. And they need to do this without being prompted to do so, or as a response to some act of terror, or it will look like they are simply doing it because they have to.There is no doubt that there are diverse Muslim communities. However surely they can all agree on this topic and speak as a united voice against it.

"Andrew Robb seems to be appealing to in his demands on ABC's Q&A on Monday night that Muslim leaders pull in their radicalised youth."This is the same Andrew Robb whose photo appears in the Fairfax press today with Bjorn Lomborg and who is pressing ahead with signing the TPP agreement without revealing whether any of our fears about its contents are justified??  Although I missed the program, and maybe his appeal was sensible, for my part I wish someone would tell me how to pull in our boringly predictable politicians of all parties.  They would be hard pressed to cobble together an original, practical idea between them.

22 Apr 2015 12:44:40pmI agree it's time for our secular nation to stop identifying this as a Muslim problem. It's a religious problem that currently involved Muslims.  However there are just as many nut jobs from other religion just waiting their turn on the lunatic stage. It's time for an adult global discussion about religion and its influence on the world. Like really, does the author believe her prophet truly flew through the sky on a winged horse?  Sadly though the Catholics are in political power ATM so they will simply bag Islam while eating the imaginary body of their imaginary friend.

22 Apr 2015 1:05:16pmSarah's approach is typical of Muslim leadership, and again rails against the idea that Islam is to blame. The unfortunate facts are that, almost universally, the youth travelling to fight with IS are Muslim. Frankly, any suggestion that this is not a problem that Muslim leaders must address is nonsensical. Andrew Robb is quite right - the rest of Australia should assist in any way it can, but this is principally a Muslim problem and leadership within the Muslim community must solve it. I refuse to accept that members of the Muslim community do not know who the radical preachers within their ranks are.

22 Apr 2015 1:32:53pmCreating the idea of an enemy is a standard right wing practice to get people to rally around the flag and forget that most of their problems are being caused by current government policies.Muslims are the latest wave of immigrants that stand out amongst the crowds due to their dress. Pressures on society by massive immigration levels of all varieties of people plus destruction of the manufacturing due to off shoring and a flood of 457 visas has made life more difficult for many people. Naturally they look for someone to blame and the government are happy to dog whistle about asylum seekers, terrorists and other 'Muslims' to keep the ignorant fearful. A decade or so ago it was Vietnamese Triad gangs that were destroying society and in another ten years or so when the current wave of Muslims from all over the world have settled in and stopped being such a 'new' experience then another right wing government will dog whistle about a new enemy to fear. Fearful people become more conservative and vote as such.

22 Apr 2015 5:42:38pmDeniers created themselves. They have spat in the face of over 100 years of scientific knowledge and replaced it with conspiracy theories. They have demonised and smeared scientists and clean energy technology with numerous lies and scare campaigns. They have refused to accept a mountain of scientific evidence and instead demanded that ignorant opinion and concocted junk science gets equal time. If they had any real evidence they could submit a peer reviewed scientific paper and be feted around the world and showered with riches. Unfortunately, repeating proven lies does not count as scientific evidence. Almost every single one of them is an avowed right winger as well. Using the same tactics of ignoring the truth to push their evidence free agenda as they do when attacking minority groups for political gain.  As a proud right winger yourself, you should look up the meaning of 'projection'. You have it in spades. It is the right wingers who claim there is some shadowy world wide conspiracy of scientists that are in league with the communists and greenies determined to make us go back and live in caves. Try reality. You might find it easier. It has worked well for civilisation, knowledge and technical advances so far.

22 Apr 2015 1:41:15pmI don't get it - when a leader like El-Sisi explicitly tells Muslim thought leaders like Al-Azhar that Islam has an extremist problem and needs to change nobody bats an eyelid.Yet if a non-Muslim like  Robb makes a comment critical of Islam it 'adds to the anguish of Muslim communities'.Both these men are saying there needs to be change in how Islam is practised if we are going to solve the problem of extremism. Because like any other religion, Islam simply is as Islam does.Of course, whenever someone tries to point out that there are problems in the doctrines of Islam - the concept of martyrdom, the promotion of violence against polytheists and unbelievers, or the life of Mohhammed - a warlord, who beheaded Jews and took slaves, which can very easily be linked to the modern practices of the Islamic State, apologists will only see bigotry.

22 Apr 2015 1:49:46pmCongratulations to the author as this article has prompted considered and educated comments. In the recent article by Ayaan Hirsi Ali published in The Australian(23 March 2015) "Islamic traditions must be rejected to end extremism". This article points out that where Sharia Law is enforceable, it literally is enforced.  In Saudi Arabia, churches and synagogues are outlawed. In Iran stoning is an acceptable punishment and homosexuals are hanged for their "crime".The practice of these laws are not the extremist behaviour of some small radicalised group but fundamental requirements of an Islamic controlled state. I personally disagree with the USA's practice of the death penalty by the way. Cheers! Ayaan Hirsi Ali's  new publication "Heretic - Why Islam needs a reformation now" offers solutions not just criticisms.
Alert moderator
22 Apr 2015 2:09:39pmI don't understand why there is article after article stating that Islam has nothing to do with the issues we are facing as a society at present. I agree there needs to acknowledgement of the fact that most Muslims are not extremist with terrorist tendencies or motivation. However, the fact that cannot be neglected is that those who are radicalised, those are support ISIS and ISIS itself, self proclaim that they are motivated by their own Islamic view and belief. By constantly claiming that the modern day spate of terrorist activities and terrorist plots have nought to do with Islam is nonsensical.If I were Islamic I would be ashamed that my fellow Muslims and my religious leaders (whether or not they are defined or implied) are not coming out and whole-heartedly damning the extreme aspects and extreme interpretations of this religion. While there remain apologists for these acts, the issue will not be dealt with.If Islam is a religion of peace, then there needs to be some clarification to the followers so that this is clear and not morphed into misguided beliefs that involve terrosism of innocent non-Muslims. This is a serious issue for Islam and a reformation of sorts is in my view needed.

22 Apr 2015 2:11:05pmRe: ABC's Q&A on Monday night.Want to know why most Australians are so frustrated with the Muslim response to the rise of Islamism?The statements made by the Muslim school teacher in the audience cut to the chase. Rather than show concern for the broader community and express relief that a terrorist attack is averted, the Muslim school teacher sole concern was on the apparent severity of the police raids in Melbourne. Tactical police had every reason to act decisively (if not heavy-handily - given the subjects of the raid were allegedly intending to kill police).To argue otherwise smacks of a dodgy, narrow agenda.

22 Apr 2015 2:13:02pmWhen the followers of islam have tolerance to criticism of their religion and their Prophet then, I'll show tolerance towards them.But while they react with threats and deeds of violence,  then they only have themselves to blame for the suspicious attitude that is aimed fairly and squarely at them.

Don't come here and try to bring your old ways with you.And before anyone attacks me, I am not racist or xenophobic.

22 Apr 2015 2:45:32pmThanks for he article Sarah, you go directly to the crux of he matter with this statement that substantiates the freewill choice of every person irrespective of faith or creed:"............ with a focus on the individual's direct relationship to God......."What you are clearly saying here is that, between the creature and the creator, there are no intermediaries. The experience is internal and intimately personal. The influence of the external "...hierarchical or mediating priest-class....." is in fact baseless and has been overblown.Each person is master of their own destiny, takes responsibility for their own actions. While the clergy do offer guidance and continuity of traditional values, it's how these values can be modified harmoniously into a complex modern society that resonates with the younger generation is more than significant than conforming to superficial practices of ancient times that no longer have relevance or meaning.Religious leaders are making a great mistake when they try to call modern youth to spiritual battle with the trumpet blasts of ancient times. The ship of civilization has already sailed out of that primitive harbour never to return.Neither democracy nor any other political panacea will take the place of spiritual progress.

They are simply veiled racist rhetoric, and are entirely based on deliberately ignorant assumptions like the one that Imams and other Islamic leaders are sheltering and even encouraging these radicalised youth.Statements like these are also used by the Coalition and the right wing commentariat to help reinforce racial stereotypes and stir up anti-multicultural sentiment, in order to bolster the Coalition's true base.Enough is enough...

22 Apr 2015 4:05:57pmBrilliantly said. For the past fifteen years I have been living and working in a variety of countries with sizable if not dominant Islamic communities, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Libya and Pakistan. I have gathered hundreds of Muslim friends and colleagues over the years, none of them are terrorists. They are all just ordinary people living ordinary lives doing ordinary jobs with ordinary aspirations for their kids and experiencing the same sorts of domestic problems that anyone experiences. I have watched the bastard media in Australia follow the US model of finding a common enemy and branding anyone who is a Muslim with the same brush as the terrorists. One only has to hear of ignorant old women in trains abusing ordinary people simply because of how they dress to understand the bigoted culture that developed over the years. Although the media does not have the capacity for introspection, they should be ashamed of what they have done at the behest of a political machine that had an agenda in dominating these Muslim countries. it is only when that is unwound will much of these issues disappear as the Yellow peril, Reds under the Beds and similar fear campaigns have disappeared.

22 Apr 2015 6:26:06pmAll Muslims are moderate and love to bring peace to those who disagree with their view on religion.  No Muslim would adhere to or condone or support any action that might put the West in a bad light. Every Muslim we meet in our country is scared and has been threatened by Westerners labelling them terrorist. There are no Terrorists in Australia except the government. The Muslims simply want to be left alone - to abide by their culture and to worship their god in the way they think is correct. Any problem or tension that has occurred is understandable because it is the West's poor decision making efforts that has created poverty, isolation, and low self esteem for "colonial nations". Australians - we should all stop being so angry, concerned, so bigoted and racist because we all know that we would be treated with the most utmost respect in any Muslim nation in the world.  Our rights would not be harmed or limited - but they would be upheld. If only we in Australia could see how wrong we have got it here - we would all want to leave Australia and relocate to these princely places. So I am puzzled: why do so many people want to come here again?

Now the grim reality is firstly that in order to do that, some people are going to have to drop, and some people are going to have to let other people rise regardless of the drop that they themselves, and their "children" will experience.Somehow this has suddenly become something that a lot of people are baulking at.

22 Apr 2015 9:00:16pmWhy are much of the media apologists for muslim extremism and blame the cause of this extremism on the Government and non-muslim population?Lets get real here, if the Muslim community cannot address the problem of Muslim youth becoming radicalized. What hope does government or the rest of the non-muslim community have?Robb is right to point out the section of the community that is likely to have the most influence.

22 Apr 2015 9:06:19pmThe author makes a reasonable suggestion, but there's much more to analyse, for instance the cultural and family dynamics that lead kids to wage their version of jihad. These kids all have parents and families, even if the parents have no idea their kids are radicalisng. Distinct differences in middle eastern (not necessarily Islamic) culture that might be encouraging the disenfranchisement that leads to radicalistion: the boy held as a 'prince', difficulty in making your way in a western secular society where success is predicated on brains and hard work, not position, relationships or patronage from a tribe or sect, and a relgious environment that continually emphasises its separateness from the non-Muslim world while at the same time dictating many facets of daily life.  It's inane to suggest the problems experienced by the middle eastern world are all due to external factors - honest analysis of what lies within will also help explain the troubling tendency of some Muslim kids to radicalise. Unfortunately, there's scant commentary from Muslims on these issues. We tend to only hear of victimisation, and faults that iie anywhere but from within.

22 Apr 2015 9:16:19pmBuddhists do not believe in gods because the conception of a pure, perfect being must lack moral responsibility. A perfect deity can't be blamed for anything.This is exactly what we see here. The author believes in the perfection of her religion and she is completely unable to accept any criticism of it.It is the idea of perfection which leads to intolerance. A perfect deity can not be challenged. Certainly no criticism could ever be correct. It is always someone else's fault. 'This makes things difficult for politicians like Mr Robb, who needs someone to cop the flak for the rash of young nutcases running to the Middle East.'No, this makes it hard for Muslims to take responsibility for the consequences of their own religion. I don't see militant Buddhists concerning anyone. 'When it's young Muslim men, the community is expected to take responsibility.'NO. When it's young Muslim men it is ISLAM that is expected to take responsibility.If these young men worked for Coca-Cola or their actions inspired by that company then there would be a boycott of the company. Leaving Islam is the morally responsible thing to do. You have the freedom to choose your religion in Australia and you have the freedom to leave it too. What does Islam offer that Buddhism or Christianity doesn't?

22 Apr 2015 10:54:42pmWell said Sarah. I am angry about these middle aged/old white men gabbing on about stuff they seem to know little about too.I am a middle aged white woman and interested in some common sense in the discussion. On Q AND A there was a discussion about suicide, stressing the terrible loss of many young people. They are very confused, irrespective to what section of the community they belong. Young men's brains do not fully develop until mid twenties...personality is a different thing...so can be rash and tempted by danger and excitement and helping "the cause," as many of these boys/young men and young women possible are.Yet what are we doing to help the youth...they need to be kept busy, employed, engaging with friends...all this requires infrastructure and community services and JOBS...our infrastructure Prime Minister (HIS words) has not yet built anything that I can name. This foolish and heartless government are locking up their compatriots and fellow migrants (asylum seekers or economic migrants whatever) in dreadful conditions and expect there to be no push back. Then wack on about the dangers of terrorists, though we have not had a terrorist attack in Australia...have had a few disgruntled maniacs commiting heinous acts in the case of Martin Place horror...and the media get hold of it and go on and on about a possible ANZAC day "attack" thus putting it front and centre in the mind of said maniacs.

23 Apr 2015 6:59:21amWhat an excellent opinion piece.  Thank you Sarah.I am not a Muslim, although I love their art of mosques et al, and the magnificent philosophical, scientific, spiritual and artistic input that Islam had into the Renaissance.  It was grand grand grand!I abhor any religious fundamentalism when it assumes direct antagonistic provocatorial social physical action of the warring kind.This business about finding 'MEANING' in this wretchedly affected IF NOTN CRIPPLED media-ted world is something with which each life-form has to contend, and phagocytically embrace and digest - not destroy.I don't think it's the responsibility of the media alone to instruct or give out to the young.  It is most definitely up to the family of origin to set the compass for their issue. So it is up to the PARENTS to shape and direct their ISSUE.  This is not a backward, repressive approach at all, if one truly understands and knows how to do it.I'm sick of older people being called 'OLD'.  They are older but not necessarily 'OLD'.  Such base nuance is so easily dismissed by young generations.  ALL TIME IS IN THE MOMENT.  PAST AND FUTURE COEXIST IN THE PRESENT MOMENT.  All the ancients intuitively understood this in one way or another which filtered into their individual cultural format.I think that generally real DISCIPLINE has been LOST.  I'm not talking of ultra strict parenting of not allowing any contact, but of having SHAME and PUNISHMENT being meted (metered) out, demonstrated, developed within the family of origin.  Sadly, sadly, sadly I find that parents of the 20th C post-war years especially,  have lost the ART OF DISCIPLINE and hence so much ART in everything else! Of course this has happened in a CONTEXT.  I think family and society has lost in all this super over-development and total deregulation of sectorial ownership and conduct.  The Professions have lost out.  Quality has become a buzz-word for 'Mickey Mouse' education and EASY defensive business which spruiks 'service' but denies robust content.So what if an individual at some time feels they are 'losing out' or not getting a chance.  It is fatuous to think that all things are to be available to all, all of the time!  It's just not sane, or economically possible.  Destroy the planet and her resources if you will, but then who wins!  Look at what has happened in the University sector just for the sake of dollars.  It's appalling.  My 'old' field of Nursing has lost all its ART in my general and specific 'take' or experience of the most recent kind.  But what is happening in our Universities has happened across the board of sectors in  'western' and increasingly 'eastern' economic, technologically-elite societies.So psychologically honest, spiritually freeing, elegant and masterful/mistressful SUSTAINABLE 'MEANING' is not found in Muslim (or other) factional terrorist extremist entities, but in the qui

Look to the radical behaviours of our non Muslim youth which has nought tondo with religion but has everything to do with dis functional family life and the rampant abuse of legally provided alcohol and drug abuse. They are creating terror and havoc in our communities on a daily basis. Where are the grim reaper ads to deter use of alcohol and drugs that fuel violence in this country ?   The government should be addressing that wholesale allowance of terror with muscle as a priority. Australians are being robbed and murdered daily by crazy intoxicated weirdos

23 Apr 2015 8:07:49amWe have to accommodate , rather than they assimilate is the basic problem , yet we cannot accommodate a culture which is inclusive only to its own and has no common ground with western cultural and civil values.Not only that but they came here presumably  not to found an Islamic nation state but to join ours, and yet we are constantly apologising and avoiding offense in our rush to accept the unacceptable.They aren't trying to fit in, they want the benefits of a successful western democracy based on judeo Christian values, while retaining a culture which fails the human rights of half its members. Every time there is an attack we apologise, and look to see what we can do to make ourselves more inclusive Bleeding hearts aren't going to soften the edges of a belief system which expects tolerance but has never delivered any.

23 Apr 2015 8:49:18amI do not personally know anyone who follows the Islam faith.  I do know from history that religion has in the distant past exercised extraordinary control over citizens.From what I have read about Islam, it is not all that different to Christian religions in that at it's heart there is a book which has been written by ordinary men in the far distant past and sections of it can be interpreted by the reader in many ways.  For those who choose to place the most basic of meanings to sections of these books there is the probability that they will interpret those sections in the most objectionable way.The Christian bible as with the book of Islam has many passages which can suggest extreme and violent repercussions for those who stray from that interpretation.It seems to me religious leaders have a very serious responsibility to provide guidance in a moderate way for the followers of the faith.  Those who preach strident views which can lead to violence and hate deserve to have scorn heaped upon them.  In other words, they need to be 'outed'.Modern education and raising of social standards in western countries have afforded people the luxury of making their own judgments about religion.  Those who choose to suppress advancement of their people and deny them freedom and education are most at fault in this problem.Those people who have voluntarily chosen to come to live in Australia have obviously done so to try to improve their way of life.  Their youth will always find ways to rebel as do most youth.  Those youths who have only known life in a country like Australia have no knowledge of the ramifications of following extremist groups and it is an awfully unforgiving way for these young people to come to the realisation of what their decisions ultimately mean.Therefore it is up to the adults in their lives to guide them just as it has always been.

23 Apr 2015 9:49:40amAfter reading all the comments here it seems to me that a lot of people think the western world is responsible for this ongoing mess. Maybe they are correct after all we invaded Muslim countries in the great crusades and have been after their oil for 100 years.However this is like saying the allies where responsible for World War II and the Germans where the poor victims of mass murder. Maybe this is also true. After all we punished Germany quite cruelly after World War I But my point is thisthe western world has been giving Muslim countries  a very hard time since the dark ages. why on earth would we let them come and live amongst us now? And after all what should we expect from them except negative attitudes?

23 Apr 2015 12:27:23pmI don't know what is the answer to Moslem radicalization.  But I am taken back to my formative years and my catholic convent education.  We Catholics were the minority group in the town, and we were taught to celebrate our difference to the other christians, who would not go to heaven, being as they refused to convert to the true Church.  We were Catholics first and Australians next.   We revelled in being discriminated against because of our religion.  As a child, I identified as Catholic, now I am Australian.  I grew up, as has the Catholic Church (to an extent).  Maybe Islam needs to go through the same process of exposure, as did the Catholic Church.
