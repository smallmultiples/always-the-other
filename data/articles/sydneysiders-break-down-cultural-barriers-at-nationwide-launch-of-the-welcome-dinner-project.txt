Sydney's multicultural community celebrated the nationwide launch of The Welcome Dinner Project, an initiative that brings together local Australians with new arrivals over a pot luck dinner, in Martin Place last night.Around 15 people took part in each dinner, contributing a dish from their culture with the aim of breaking down barriers and creating friendships between people from diverse backgrounds.Penny Elsley, the founder of community organisation Joining The Dots, started the project last year with the hope of bringing together people from all walks of life."One lady who is a Chinese Australian invited a whole group of Tibetan refugees into her home. It was very powerful," she said. "It's about saying no matter what our paths, our backgrounds or the things that are happening in different countries in the world, we can actually come together here in Australia and see each other just as we are."Paul Metcalfe, who lives on Sydney's Northern Beaches with his young family, opened up his home to a group of Tibetan refugees last year after hearing about the initiative.It's about saying no matter what our paths, our backgrounds or the things that are happening in different countries in the world. "There's lots of benefits from these types of projects," he said."It allows us to do something without having to get involved with a lot of agencies or governments."We can do something that's really heartfelt - opening your front door and letting people in to share the abundance we have. It allows us to have a conversation and just compare each other's lives."It deepens both the awareness of where people come from, the circumstances they face, and the sort of life they want to have living in Australia."Western Sydney mother Maisoon Yalda came to Australia in 2007 with her young family as refugees from Baghdad. She fled Iraq after her father was kidnapped and murdered, staying in Syria for two years before heading to Australia.When she first came to Sydney she said she felt alone and disconnected from the community."When I came here some people helped me but not a lot," she said."I want to do the opposite thing now, I want to help people."Ms Yalda took part in her first welcome dinner in December last year, hosting an Australian family of four in Sydney.She said it is important to reach out to new arrivals like refugees and asylum seekers.Last night, tables were filled with food from a range of cultures including Chinese, African and Indian. Sydneysiders joined their counterparts in other states through Skype to celebrate the nationwide launch of the dinner project.Ms Elsley hopes the project will take off globally.
