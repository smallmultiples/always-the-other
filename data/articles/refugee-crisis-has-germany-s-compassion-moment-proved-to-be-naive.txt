Germany's compassionate response to the refugee crisis is over. Serious discussion can no longer be postponed. How will the 1.1 million people who have recently sought asylum become German? Matthew Dal Santo writes.Since her decision last August to suspend the so-called Dublin Regulation - requiring all refugees to lodge their claims in the first EU state they enter - German Chancellor Angela Merkel's watch word has been "compassion".Until the events in Cologne that sufficed to carry most Germans with her. But in the aftermath of those events, has the welcome Germans extended proved naive and misguided?Under compassion's banner, Merkel tapped a reservoir of open-minded goodwill and public-spirited generosity among Germans. But it also made possible numerous sleights of hand.Compassion is an unmediated sentiment, demanding of me that I do something now to help a fellow human being in desperate physical need.Between us it offers a thrilling moment of inter-personal connection, blind to everything but our common humanity. The thrill is so satisfying that 18th century philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau believed compassion to be a naturally self-interested sentiment.Significantly, Merkel rejects multiculturalism, which she calls 'a grand delusion'. But what sort of relationship with German culture will a million mainly Muslims form? But beyond the alleviation of momentary need, compassion stays largely silent. Does it dictate that the fellow human being (and his or her descendants) whom I have helped (his or her need now alleviated) become a fellow citizen?Does it establish a lasting political or spiritual covenant between us? Should it?Arguing from compassion allowed Merkel to allay Germans' fears about accepting a massive influx of new settlers by leaving open the ambiguity, inherent in compassion, about the long-term purpose of Germans' generous helping hand. On a European level, Pope Francis continues to do this too.The Cologne New Year's Eve attacks, and incidents like it elsewhere in Germany (and also in Sweden, whose refugee policies are even more generous and unquestioning than Germany's) have hastened a souring already discernible before Christmas.The 'compassion' moment is over. Serious discussion can no longer be postponed. Now that immediate physical need has been alleviated, questions so far avoided must be asked. How will the 1.1 million people who have sought asylum in Germany become Germans?Significantly, Merkel rejects multiculturalism, which she calls 'a grand delusion'. But what sort of relationship with German culture will a million mainly Muslims form? The glorious gothic Cologne Cathedral loomed mutely over the New Year's Eve mob. Luther's German Bible moulded the German language.Yet how many asylum-seekers or their children will read it? If they are pious Muslims, what will they make of Germany's Christian heritage and liberal, post-Christian culture?Will they find a dialogue with Immanuel Kant's Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, Friedrich Nietzsche's Death of God, or Hegelian dialectic- as German Protestants and Catholics had to before them.Some doubtless will. But what will historical 'German-ness' mean to the majority? Frederick the Great? Bismarck? Wilhelm II? Hitler and the Holocaust? Bach? Goethe? Brecht?These are deeply unfashionable questions to ask. A duty of compassion saw 1.1 million people enter Germany on the grounds of a shared humanity. But now they must become something particular: German. No nation (with the possible exception of the United States) can afford merely to be an empty receptacle of 'universal values'.She decided to ignore the 'lines on the map' and strike her own blow for human freedom and dignity ... But without those arbitrary lines on the map, there are no nations and no politics. Reinforcing the logic of humanitarian compassion that has suppressed these questions is neo-liberal economics.In her New Year's Eve speech hours before the mob gathered in Cologne, Merkel described the refugee influx as an economic "opportunity".This can be unkindly rephrased as saying that asylum-seekers are a resource to be exploited in the competitive environment of a globalized economy.The notion, fashionable among some Australian 'conservatives', that Germany's refugee crisis is due to the malign effects of 'socialism' or 'Marxism' is thus wrong. Its wellspring is profoundly liberal.Merkel is neither a socialist nor a Marxist: life in the economically backward GDR convinced her of that. The austerity she has imposed on Greece is Hayekian. Her handling of Russia has shown her to be an Atlanticist of almost Reaganite commitment.Her primary motivation is not social justice but freedom.Merkel was 35 years old when East Germans brought down the Berlin Wall. That act consigned not only communism but also their country to the dustbin of history. Her life story thus confirms that freedom trumps 'arbitrary' national borders.When hundreds of thousands of refugees began arriving at Hungarian train stations six months ago demanding forward passage to Germany, it must have seemed to Merkel as if she were reliving 1989, not as a physicist in East Berlin but de facto leader of Europe.A decade ago, French philosopher Pierre Manent warned that Europe was ‘experiencing an anti-political or humanitarian temptation’ ... Today, Merkel’s Germany embodies that temptation. Consistent with her experience then, she saw not Syrians or Afghans, nor thousands of unaccompanied young men, but human beings obstructed in their goal of a better life by wire fences and border guards. She decided to ignore the 'lines on the map' and strike her own blow for human freedom and dignity.The problem, of course, is not that many of those who have taken advantage of Germany's compassion do not have a good claim to asylum. It's that, like global capital, Merkel's alternately humanitarian and neo-liberal open-borders policy ultimately treats the nation-state as a thing of the past.But without those arbitrary lines on the map, there are no nations and no politics. Democracy on internationalist terms is impossible. The nation-state remains the only true arena for the pursuit of democratic politics. Economically and demographically, too, Germany's opportunity is Syria's loss: even a globalized economy registers no 'net gain' for humanity.A decade ago, French philosopher Pierre Manent warned that Europe was 'experiencing an anti-political or humanitarian temptation', 'a much softer temptation, to be sure, and so more tempting' than the totalitarian ideologies of the twentieth century, but one that 'may soon appear to be hardly more bearable'. The European Union, he feared, was on its way to implementing 'the institutionalization of the end of politics, the reduction of common life to the rights and rules of civil society'.Today, Merkel's Germany embodies that temptation. The collusion of the authorities and media in the decision that the public could not be trusted with knowledge of what happened in Cologne - and, perhaps even more damningly - that asylum-seekers' involvement was so dangerous to German social cohesion that their presence had to be edited out of the official record - recalls Soviet censorship practices, except that no KGB was necessary. Self-censorship sufficed.It reminds us of Manent's warning. Even in the name of compassion, do we really want to live in a world beyond politics?Matthew Dal Santo is a Danish Research Council post-doctoral fellow at the Saxo Institute, University of Copenhagen.

But...let us not get confused with our totally opposite and barbaric lack of action on those refugees on Manus and Nauru. Killing refugees by stealth seems to be what Australia is tolerating.

21 Jan 2016 11:38:11amGerard, surely it is time for you to change the record.The stopping of the boats and the offshore detention centres have proved to have stopped illegal migrants entering Australia. Those still on Manus and Nauru, have been given other resettlement options, but they have chosen not too take those options up. The message has to be unequivocal, attempts to enter Australia illegally will not result in a permanent settlement outcome.

21 Jan 2016 12:14:01pmHi al,While you have a point, and the issue of refugees is not as simple as Gerard makes out, you need to be careful with the use of the phrase "illegal migrants".  Gerard is actually referring to "refugees" which has a very different legal meaning.  Further, while the stopping of boats appears to have reduced deaths at sea, which is a good thing, there is one serious flaw in the current policy, i.e  The secrecy around "operational matters".  While arguments have been made about not informing the so called "people smuggler trade', this argument does not trump the importance of transparency in a democratic society like ours.  While secrecy has a role in military matters, the arrival of refugees is not a military matter, hence the secrecy around it is in direct contradiction with democratic principles.  Further, the secrecy leads to suspicion which, ironically, undermines the policy (e.g. "do we really know what happens to refugees who chose to arrive by boat?").  Voters should know exactly what is going on so they know what it is they are voting for when they go to the ballet box.  Anything else is undemocratic.

21 Jan 2016 12:50:45pmCan we please stop calling these people 'refugees'. Once you are out of danger you are no longer a refugee, you are an economic migrant.That is why we have 'refugee camps' - places people can go to escape danger. Just as in Europe, these people aren't escaping violence, they're shopping around for the best place to live.Europe has already begun to reap the whirlwind.

There's a difference between the temporary safety (in that your are not in immediate danger of being killed) of camp or transit country and the sense of belonging, rights and obligations that citizenship provides. As for Europe, 2 incidents conducted by a tiny minority of the 1 million refugees is enough to condemn all refugees everywhere? In the French case some of the terrorists were nationals and the German authorities have also said some of the attacks in cologne where done by other Germans, but that doesn't get a mention often.There is no doubt that a human exodus of this order will affect European nations positively and negatively. But it would good if just once in a while people recognize that the majority of refugees currently in Europe are not guilty of the crimes of a few

21 Jan 2016 9:16:58pmYou are correct. All asylum should be temporary but renewable, with citizenship at the discretion of the receiving country. If so, people would be more accepting of hosting migrants temporarily. Most modern movements have been episodic, with a limit. This is different. It is far better to support large numbers close to home until they can move back safely.But it is clear that almost the whole of Syria will empty if allowed- and most of Iraq. From all sides of the conflict, bringing the enmity with them.It will keep happening until Europe says no and means it. The movement to Germany was a fraction of the number before Merkel's madness. Do German children not hear the story of Humpty Dumpty? She must not have been listening.

22 Jan 2016 2:01:19amHoward's treatment of the issue is telling, because one routinely overlooked fact is that the Howard government ultimately accepted almost 100% of the 'boat people' who applied for refugee status during their time in government (including every single one of the infamous Tampa arrivals).I.e. Howard used the issue as a dog whistle, but once the media attention had passed, he very quietly reversed his position. His 'boat people' rhetoric was purely for electoral benefit, he knew full well that they were genuine refugees, and even Howard wasn't cruel enough to send them back, despite passing legislation allowing him to do so with minimal scrutiny.Which raises a troubling moral issue. If the Howard government ultimately had no objection to their refugee claims, then the whole act was nothing more or less than the deliberate infliction of wholly undeserved cruelty upon one group of people, for the purpose of deterring other people.We should not treat people as mere tools in the pursuit of some further and more distant end. Regardless of what size our refugee intake, the more important Malachor 5 proprotosed atarrived.

21 Jan 2016 3:47:19pmDrumroller.The term "refugee" is a legal status which only applies to people who are fleeing active persecution. The term does not apply to people who are fleeing just because they don't like the consequences of life in a war zone. The term also ceases to apply to a refugee who is no longer under active persecution when they try to cross a border. This commonly occurs when a refugee obtains safety in one country, but continues to other countries to "window shop" and improve their situation. The purpose of the conventions is to ensure that people under persecution can find safety in the closest neighbouring country, then return home when the situation improves. The Conventions are not designed to facilitate migration - and the majority of the problems are being caused by people who are trying to exploit it.

Take a look at the regional newspapers in the above countries for the truth about Europe's refusal to condemn the actions of these men, including the feminist organisations who appear to be defending these men at the expense of their own women.All I can say is thank God for Tony Abbott who had the sense and the guts to put a stop to these people who have NO desire to adopt our ways.

22 Jan 2016 12:27:25pmDrum Roller,You make a number of statements which can only possibly be explained by pure ignorance of events.I will respond in two parts. (part 1)"Can we please stop inferring that the majority of refugees we know zero about are probably all economic migrants" - the reality is that the migrants can be easily identified as migrants and not legitimate refugees fleeing from government persecution in their home countries. The facts are clear. The vast majority are in fact simply economic migrants seeking to migrate to nations like Germany, UK and Sweden in order to obtain access to the most advantageous welfare systems. To put this in perspective in the 3rd quarter of 2015 (when migrant flows were at their maximum) Syrians made up just 25% of Asylum claims in the EU (the next largest group were Albanians), and that isn't taking into account the vast quantity of migrants who do not attempt to claim asylum as they are simply illegal migrants who represent the vast majority of migrants to the EU."As for Europe, 2 incidents conducted by a tiny minority .....". Two incidences? what? where have you been hiding? have you missed the large number of terror attacks in France last year by migrants/asylum seekers? did you miss the highly orchestrated and organised sexual assaults/rapes conducted by hundreds/thousands of migrant/asylum seekers all over Europe on new years eve which occurred in every major city in Germany, as well as Helsinki (1,000+ Iraqi), Sweden, Austria, France, Switzerland etc. What was witnessed and experienced in Europe was something previously completely unheard of. Never before has Europe seen hundreds/thousands of men organised / orchestrate (which involved travelling to other cities to undertake the acts) the mass sex assault and rape of women. These events (600+ sexual assaults and 3 rapes reported to police in cologne alone!) are just the tip of the ice berg of the long standing problems associated with Islamic doctrines, doctrinal teachings and cultural norms.Continued.....
Alert moderator
22 Jan 2016 12:28:48pm(part 2)continued....."German authorities have also said some of the attacks in cologne where done by other Germans" - no they have not. They authorities attempted to suggest that some might have been German when the news first broke in order to continue to lie to the public. Which was promptly followed up with victim blaming and suggestions women keep at "arms length" from men and that they should take men with them to protect them from other men (although that hadn't helped on New Years when fathers were intentionally separated from their daughters and wives/partners who were then sexually assaulted). The reality eventually admitted by the police/authorities was that it was an attack exclusively organised and orchestrated by migrants/asylum seekers from the Middle East and North Africa. Just as they were in other cities all over Europe.Merkel's unilateral decision to cast aside the EU rules in relation to asylum seekers (the Dublin Agreement which required asylum seekers to lodge claims in the first nation in which they arrive) has fundamentally altered the social and political nature of the EU as her decision resulted in a flood of illegal migration that has overwhelmed Europe and already caused nations to seek to remove themselves for the EU (ie. the UK), to block migration (right across Europe) and to close internal borders (ie. France continues to maintain its state of emergency and controlled border, others have shut their internal borders).The reality is that the media and authorities are no long able to hide the unpalatable truth about the social problems caused by allowing the mass migration of muslim men into Europe. The long standing silence by authorities in order to comply with "PC niceties" and to not be cast as "racist" has now becoming slowly replaced with evidence of widespread cover ups of an ongoing problem relating to sexual violence towards girls/women by muslim migrants to Europe (as well as other issues in relation to other criminal acts).Europe stands on the cusp of a political swing to the right of a level unseen in close to a hundred years. And that bodes ill for everyone.Merkel got her picture on the cover of Time magazine....but at what cost for Europe and at what cost for the people who live in Europe.

Abbott was playing them for fools and Turnbull keeps it going.Up to 190,000 permanent migration places will be available in 2015-16 as announced by the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection (the ignoble and deserving winner of the Crikey "arsehat of the year award") as part of the Budget on 12 May 2015.That's Liberal policy. You racial purists didn't realise, did you? You were so excited by the thought of boat refugees suffering for daring to want to come here that you didn't look.It's going to be similar next year and the year after and the year after, many migrants being skilled so that their own countries lose their skills and the migrants absolve the Australian government of the need to educate and train natural born Australians, to continue their attack on education here.Given Germany has a population just on 4 times that of Australia, the influx to Australia is about the same as 760,000 migrants arriving in Germany. However, many of the new arrivals in Germany will want to return to their homelands as soon as the bloody wars and bombings subside, so really, Australia has a much bigger impact from migration than Germany.So laugh and gloat old fellas, but think about why this government is so cruel to legal refugees who happen to come by boat. It's a diversion to gratify the masses and you are each one of them.I know what you will say in reply: Trivially and irrelevantly, you regard Crikey as less than graffiti on the toilet wall, but you will have no counter to the substance of the truth above.

So the policy you mention is fine by people who have that view - as such the economic migrant who gets in line, provides the required evidence of their background, skills etc and waits the required time to come here gets here. The people who don't do that end up in detention centres.No doubt there is a small number of racists out there that love the stop the boats policy. But it isn't designed for them.

I would think that (almost) everyone knows that and have no problem with it. Of course there are genuine refugees in the world and Australia should, and does, take a share of them.Organised and planned migration quotas and refugee intake is not the problem, its the illegal, disorganised and unplanned scramble of people whose claim to refugee status is often questionable that most people can't tolerate and Germany is discovering that, now that its too late.As for calling me a racial purist, you should know that as a person of German descent, I find that term offensive and you, using it to describe supporters of the governments border policy, diminishes what the true meaning of a racial purist is. if you're unsure, Google Endlosung, then you'll know
Alert moderator
21 Jan 2016 2:09:58pmRay - as you say on a pro rata basis, our intake is comparable to Germanys recent intake of 'asylum seekers' BUT as you've also pointed out, we have 190,000 places per annum. So Germany's is a one-of (albeit a pretty enormous one) and it remains to be seen if they will take anything like that flood of humanity this year or next. Their usual migrant places, although substantial is considerably smaller and fluctuates but by comparison is much smaller per head than ours.  That plus the natural increase of the resident migrant population with a birth rate many times that of native Germans, means it could drastically and permanently alter the national demographic within a generation.  We do not face that as we are still a pretty mixed bunch of migrants and their descendants - 'one-of's' like the 12,000 from the Syrian crisis will not alter our mixed demographic.  The real question in my mind is holding the government to its promise to choose oppressed minorities.  These are people who have nothing to go back to and face the worst if they tried - mostly Christians.  And its not just Syria - 30,000 Christians fled Mosul when IS took over and they are unlikely to ever be able to return.  Puts our pledge to take in 12,000 into perspective. I don't see the Germans (or the rest of the EU) or the Americans or Canadians take anywhere near that from amongst the non-Muslim minorities that so desperately (and genuinely) need asylum.

21 Jan 2016 3:09:23pmThat's just weasel words Doc. The number of "places" is entirely arbitrary and based on a minister's estimate.Even under Labor and even under Howard the number of refugees accepted as immigrants was only a few tens of thousands. It matters little how they arrive, whether it's Syrians by boat or Chinese by plane. It's the boat arrivals who are being scapegoated as a diversion from the proportional huge intake of immigrants, yet there is little likelihood that the boat arrivals are less worthy than any others. It's also very inefficient because it's very expensive and we gain little while making arseholes of our selves in the eyes of the civilised world.Our treatment of refugees in the camps is comparable to the Nazis treatment of Jews.

21 Jan 2016 5:31:25pm"the influx to Australia is about the same as 760,000 migrants arriving in Germany"One crucial difference between Germany and Australia is that none of the German 1.1m unplanned entrants  have been identity checked, health and security screened, or assessed for their individual usefulness to the national economy of Germany and their adaptability to the German society PRIOR TO ARRIVAL.Every single one of our 190,000 permanent migrants will be so screened, checked  and individually selected, well before stepping on the Australian soil for the first time. The 190,000 approved to come will leave behind a significantly larger number of the refused, who will never come here, even though they would very much like to.Do you seriously equate a mass unplanned influx of self-selected migrants, whose background. motivation, affiliations, and often identity, are unknown at the point of entry, with a carefully preplanned and managed Australian national migration program, operating with a Cabinet-approved quota that is not to be exceeded regardless of demand?

22 Jan 2016 12:46:44amRayS, please compare like with like.Whilst it is true that around 190,000 settlers immigrate to Australia with approval, it is also true that roughly half this number emigrate from Australia each year as well.  Leaving net settler migration to Australia at around 90,000 people a year.  It is this net figure that asylum seekers (wannabe settlers) should be compared against.In 2012/13 when net planned settler arrivals to Australia was 100,000 (which included a provision for 7,500 onshore asylum visa grants), 25,000 wannabe settlers arrived by boat, and a further 8,000 wannabe settlers arrived by plane.  Thus, in 2012/13, and courtesy of a government which had abdicated sovereignty over migration, around 25% more settlers/wannabe settlers came to Australia than was desired.How many settlers did Germany seek to attract in 2015?  I don't have a number for that.  But it is pretty obvious that the number that Germany was seeking was much much fewer than the 1.1 million who came.In terms of settler overruns, Germany beats Australia hands down.

21 Jan 2016 1:07:39pmHi AndrewI deliberately choose the phrase "illegal migrants" as that is what they are. A "refugee" has become such a nuanced term and is now being abused and manipulated to include all and sundry who make false claims of persecution. Most are economic aspirants, and if they try and enter Australia without a valid visa, then they are acting illegally.
Alert moderator
21 Jan 2016 3:59:19pmIf the reason for "refugees" fleeing is to escape the oppressive regimes, why do they insist on continuing the "escape" through many countries that share their culture so they can arrive in a Western country that has a completely alien culture. It seems the vast majority, especially single young men, are "illegal migrants" or "economic refugees"
Alert moderator
21 Jan 2016 5:42:06pmNo, 2right. It's the planned migrant intake which are economic migrants. They come to Australia to earn better income, or else why come? The whole 190k of them are economic migrants, obviously.The boat people on the other hand come on a dangerous voyage at great risk to their lives and most are genuinely in fear and at risk.That must surely be obvious by their circumstances and the route they have to take.  These arguments you all repeat again and again are self-evidently rubbish.
Alert moderator
21 Jan 2016 6:37:36pmRayS. Mexicans risk their lives to enter America simply because they want a job. Risking your life is not proof that a person is a genuine refugee.Most of the boat people were previously in Indonesia. If they weren't being actively persecuted in Indonesia, then they are obliged to remain there. Otherwise, leaving Indonesia disqualifies them as a refugee.
Alert moderator
21 Jan 2016 6:55:36pmRayS, if you also want to call people who arrive via the planned migration scheme "economic migrants", then then "refugees" who are economic migrants and therefore economic migrant queue jumpers.Also what do they genuinely fear, and what are they at risk from, in Indonesia and all the other countries they travel through before they jump on a boat and destroy their documents?

Why put your family through the danger and hardship once you've escaped the regimes they fear, places like Saudi Arabia, Russia, China are a lot closer and far richer than Australia.
Alert moderator
22 Jan 2016 11:58:15amRayS, I've read your earlier posts and the replies, but I simply cannot remain silent any longer in the face of your continuing misapplication of the facts.Of course the 190,000 migrants come here because they consider that their lives will be improved. But in order to do so they request migration, they supply required information, they accede to security checks and agree to health examinations.The people who arrive by boat are illegal and dishonest in every respect. They do not seek "asylum" as they have already gained that status, and wilfully abandoned it. They are not fleeing danger or risk and are not in fear for their lives. They do not give honest information about identity or background. They do not submit themselves to the required entry procedures and they undertake "a dangerous voyage" deliberately, criminally and knowing that they are committing crimes. They demand that they be accepted by virtue of the sole fact of having arrived.A little over a year ago I stood outside the main railway station in Munich and watched 10,000 illegal entrants get off a train (which they had boarded without permission and without paying fares) and saw Senegalese, Afghanis, Eritreans and Iranians all claiming to be fleeing for their lives from Syria. They are the equivalent of our boat people.

21 Jan 2016 2:18:18pmI find it interesting that you assume those who supported the Abbott/Turnbull plan to stop the boats would necessarily be "racial purists." It's just possible that those who supported the stop the boats program understand what problems can be presented by uncontrolled influxes of people.  It is just possible that you yourself have a bit of racism under the skin, since you seem to be afraid of skilled migrants who happen not to be white stealing jobs from Australians.  In any case, it's one thing to have a planned and managed immigration program, with skills and language criteria as part of the package, and quite another to have uncontrolled open borders with no entry criteria, no ability to control the numbers of arrivals or to effectively manage the provision of housing, medical and social support and education, never mind absorb them into the labour market.  The conditions under which Australia accepts selected migrants (and offshore resettlement cases) in a planned program are completely different from the ad hoc approach the Germans are having to take in coping with a massive influx of self-selected arrivals.  They are not entirely different, however, from the pressures put on Australia by the arrivals of all those boats in the last years of the ALP government.  Huge numbers of applicants, refugee determination systems unable to cope with the numbers or with the reality that the inflow of to Germany, like the boats, involves a mixed movement of genuine refugees and economic migrants, slow and cumbersome removal processes for the non-genuine, and then the difficulties of providing support, housing and social services for large numbers of people without language and often without employment skills.  Comparing the planned immigration of skilled workers to the uncontrolled influx of a mix of refugees and economic migrants is frankly nonsense.

Asylum seekers coming by boat are quickly intercepted and can be quickly processed if there is the political will. Instead, this Government keeps them indefinitely in detention and subjects them to various forms of abuse. Oh, and don't forget, the Government keeps the information about new boat arrivals secret.... for as long as they can!! 
Alert moderator
21 Jan 2016 6:14:37pmMore rubbish.Every person who arrives by air do so legally, with proper documentation and identification. Entry into Australia is only permitted after screening and checking at the airport. Air arrivals are LEGAL entrants.Moreover, DIAC reports show that less than 5% of air arrival become "illegal migrants" by failing to comply with visa regulations. These visa breaches are inevitably an "overstaying" offence, but DIAC states that the overstay period is usually only for a very short period, a matter of days, and is usually for some approved purpose such as seeking visa extension or category change or inability to travel due to sickness or other reason.People arriving by boat are not "asylum seekers" because they have secured asylum and have intentionally abandoned it in an attempt to enter what is seen as a more desirable country. Such people are kept in detention because they wilfully refuse to co-operate with the authorities on matters such as identity and background, and are free to avoid detention and any alleged "abuse" simply by asking to go home.

You and I both know that the people in those places are free to leave anytime they choose to, the only stipulation is that they are not permitted to come to Australia, this has been made quite plain to them from the start. It is also evident that these people are not legitimate refugees but are in fact economic opportunists who have no claim to automatic access to our country.

With no media allowed access and no independent monitoring how are we to know want is being done in our name and with our money?Apparently the Australian people will accept any sort of barbarity in order to stop the boats.

21 Jan 2016 2:58:24pmHi FGR. The resolution of what to do with those still on Manus and Nauru is the same as what transpired During the Howard years.After the success of the Pacific solution the heat went out of the issue. Those remaining in offshore detention were quietly sent to Australia. Some did try to make political capital out of it by drawing attention to it and claiming that the Pacific solution failed because they still made it to Australia in the end.However the truly compassionate realised that the best way to keep the quiet flow to Australia was to keep their mouthes shut.The truly compassionate did not call for transparency, they did not point to policy failure because Australia still took those remaining in detention.It will take a bit longer this time around because we have social media and internet sites such as this that Howard did not have to contend with to such a degree.We also have many more advocates etc who make a living out of boat arrivals and have a vested interest in this issue. When we start to quietly take those on the islands into Australia the worst that can happen is headlines that claim that you can make it to Australia after all. If the people smugglers use those headlines to refresh their trade and the boats resume the doors will slam shut.You can keep quiet and allow it to happen or you can call for transparency and delay it. You can forgo political capital and allow it to happen or you can insist on political point scoring and prevent it happening at all.

21 Jan 2016 8:19:51pmTend to agree with you, Esteban - the more noise the "let-em-all-in" mob makes the less the likelihood of either major political party agreeing to do so.BTW, less than half of the 1650 (give or take) people sent to Nauru and Manus during the Howard-era Pacific Solution actually made it to Australia.

Are you saying that because a host nation has an existing sexual assault problem, it would be impolite or even 'racist' to address the sexual assaults committed by new arrivals?If a reckless migration policy opens the door to thousands of unidentified males from societies notorious for female abuse and results in the increase of rates of rape, then that policy needs fixing.

Seriously, I suggest you take a good hard look at your beliefs and your general attitude to the men of Australia.  It's offensive. I would add ill-informed, but there's nothing infomed at all about the comment. It's just a made up rubbish without any substantiation. It's un-hinged thinking in my humble opinion.

21 Jan 2016 2:04:05pmDear Bystander,Since you asked the question twice and no one responded, I will provide you with statistical data.-There were 19,781 recorded sexual assaults in Australia in 2007, with 94 victims per 100,000 of the population.-1 in 5 women and 1 in 20 men have experienced sexual violence since the age of 15 years (Australian Bureau of Statistics Personal Safety Survey, 2006)-1 in 3 women and 1 in 6 men will be sexually abused before the age of 16 (Fergusson & Mullen, 1999)-93 per cent of offenders are male (National Statistics - Crime & Safety Survey, 2002)-Intimate partner violence is the leading contributor of preventable death, disability and illness in Victorian women aged 15-44. It is responsible for more of the disease burden than high blood pressure, smoking or obesity (VicHealth, 2004)-1 in 6 reports to Police of rape and less than 1 in 7 reports of incest or sexual penetration of a child result in prosecution (Sexual Offences: Law & Procedure Final Report, Victorian Law Reform Commission, 2004)-Family violence affects 1 in 5 women in Victoria (Victorian Government, Office of the Premier, A New Approach to Reduce Family Violence, Media Release, 27 April, 2007)-Family Violence costs Australia about $8 billion per hear, a substantial proportion of which is borne by the victims themselves (Vic Health, 2004)-An estimated 27 per cent of children who are in homes where violence was being experienced by a current partner had witnessed the violence (Australian Bureau of Statistics Personal Safety Survey, 2006)-14 per cent (1 in 7) of women sexually assaulted by a current partner and 16 per cent (just over 1 in 6) by any other male reported to the Police (Australian component of International Violence Against Women Survey,2004)-In 2005 an estimated 44,100 persons aged 18 years and over were victims of at least one sexual assault. This is a victimisation prevalence rate of 0.3 per cent. Approximately 72,000 incidents of sexual assault were experienced by these victims (National Crime & Safety Surveys, 2005)

21 Jan 2016 3:36:22pmDear David YBefore any of those numbers mean anything, we need a some background.What is held to be "sexual abuse"?What is "sexual violence"?I find it hard to believe that 1 in 3 and 1 and 5 women respectively have suffered those, unless the definition is incredibly broad.  Where would commenting that a woman has "piercing eyes" fall?  Where would putting your arm around her shoulder?Quoting statistics is fun, but pretty meaningless without further info..  For example, domestic violence stats are inflated incredibly by the number of assaults on indigenous women in remote communities.  That is not to demean those women or downplay the assaults, but it does make it less of a widespread problem and more an issue for small groups.A comparison of "Australian" stats compared to those of particular ethnic groups would be interesting I suspect, but we will never be allowed to see them.  It is notable that Scandinavian sexual assaults have increased markedly since they allowed in members of certain misogynistic groups.
Alert moderator
21 Jan 2016 3:40:21pm"Intimate partner violence is the leading contributor of preventable death"  This statement should be taken in full not out of context.  What is left out here is two things. One is that the figure for DV is 9% of the total for preventable disease.  Mental illness rates higher. When considered against all death and injury DV does not make the top 10.

That is an undeniable fact and not talking about it won't make the issue disappear.We would like to help but we want them to be like us or at least assimilate. As long as they continue to bite the hand that feeds them there will be louder calls to send them back to where they came from.

21 Jan 2016 12:11:55pmCompletely agree Gerard.The number of arrivals even under Labor have never been a danger to social cohesion in Australia. This very firm message from the Liberals that it does not matter how goals are achieved as long as you get the result you want is the opposite of what any parent would teach their child. When drug dealers make a million dollars we do not applaud their astute business nous, and we should not applaud a government that abuses children to "keep Australians safe". Morrison, Dutton, Abbott and anyone else involved in the human rights abuses of children belong in jail.
Alert moderator
21 Jan 2016 12:47:59pmThe numbers arriving under Labor were increasing from year to year to year, Benny. Did you really expect us to wait until the numbers were a threat and the completely predictable outcome was a reality? Your and Gerard's priorities were presented to the Australian voters by the Greens in multiple elections. The voters rejected them because the priorities of the majority of voters are different to yours. We prioritise the safety of Australians over the ability of foreigners to pick a country and move to it regardless of the desires of the country in question (which in this case was ours). Now that our predictions about Europe are coming true and the news of asylum seekers attacking European women are leaking out I seriously doubt that the priorities of most Australian voters are gong to change any time soon.

21 Jan 2016 1:58:16pmReaver.I am well aware the majority of Australian voters are afraid of their own shadows and would rather run into the arms of snake oil salesmen promising to keep them safe from the demon children of "illegals" than face up to there responsibility to be functioning human beings. There are NO circumstances under which child abuse is acceptable. It's that simple. Find another way to stop the boats if it is so crucial to the "good" people of Australia. The problem with that is the Liberals refuse to discuss alternatives while they cast a blanket of secrecy around their abusive policies. They do it because Australians are cheering them on like scared bullies.
Alert moderator
21 Jan 2016 3:02:32pmBenny Wormtongue, we are not afraid of our own shadows. We simply want law and order, which is not too much to ask, is it?Policies are not abusive. Every one of those people in the detention centres have been offered to be settled elsewhere. They refuse and demand to come to Australia. Therefore it (their continued detention) is their own fault, and for me it only serves to prove the illegitimacy of their claims.

21 Jan 2016 6:04:51pmIt is very revealing to see here so many people proudly exclaiming how they have "won" by "stopping" the boats. They exult in the idea of leaving people in limbo for years in a hell hole where secrecy rules.In other words, they support barbaric action not supported by the UNHCR or Amnesty International. They claim they are being "pragmatic" in protecting their borders. But is this action legal according to international law? Or is the unilateral decision made by an Oz government the measure of law and morality?What if the boats have not stopped? Just not coming to Oz? And are some of those who might have  come by boat now having to trek overland and dare to cross to Greece in boats or go further north? And some of them are dying - including children? Out of sight, out of mind.  King Abbott Canute just waves his hand and all the refugees/economic migrants/illegals turn away at the command. it is as if they have no excuse for fleeing. (In fact, one argument is that they should stay and fight. What a useful, pragmatic idea.  So full of empathy.)What is revealing is the statistic that 62 individuals in the world own as much wealth as 300bn people of the world. So money counts. If you have it, you can buy yourself a plane flight into Oz. If you do not have a piece of paper for whatever reason, you can't.If you have the money you can live very well. If you have no money, it is probably because you are lazy and have not been trying. You are expecting someone else to give you a handout. You might even think you can jump a queue. such wickedness!All this demonisation of the less fortunate is what we are seeing waged against the less fortunate in Oz. The idea of the leaners and the lifters. I'm all right, Jack. How are you?And we wonder why people are looking for something but we don't want them to, really. Even thought he intervention of the West has made a mess of the Middle East. We just watch on tv as the the Middle East is reduced to rubble.   We have had all this debate before.

21 Jan 2016 3:30:12pmBenny, I am not afraid of boat people and I am not against refugees arriving in this country. In fact i believe that Australia and me personally have gained greatly from getting to know many arrives to this country. How ever I am against the cruel and heartless organisations of people smugglers who risk innocent lives for there own game. They charge money and enslave people. They only way to stop this trade is to stop the boats from coming. If you encourage boats you encourage this behavior that has cost many lives at sea. I am glade that we have a government that will stand up to illegal behavior of people smugglers and am confused why others think that criminal organisations should be able to control people entering our country.

21 Jan 2016 12:54:15pmThe true abusers of children in detention are the parents who illegally migrated, risking their lives as we saw on the beach in that famous propaganda photo. Tragically in that instance the dad was only seeking some dentistry and took the life jacket for himself. He needed to as he was up front piloting the illegal entry vessel having pocketed the cash for doing so. These are the people you defend? Their first act in their new country to flout the laws of migration, endanger their children and then demand to be let in to whatever country the choose.

21 Jan 2016 2:43:42pmI thought you were referring to the claims of sexual abuse of children in the detention centres. Now you are simply defining  detention as "abuse". It is not "indefinite" as they are free to leave at any time, just not free to settle in Australia until their claims are either verified or rejected. There were thousands in detention under the previous government  versus only a small fraction of that now - happy?

It sounds like they are free to do as the Liberals tell them and nothing much more to me.

21 Jan 2016 3:01:46pmNo they would never do that. They are desperate people escaping certain death in their country of birth. When they arrived uninvited bypassing all the UN centres on the way they became people in "OUR" care so we are told, and as such it is the Governments problem. The fact that they do it to their fellow "children of god" is irrelevant. As the majority of people in remote communities rely on the Government for their food and shelter and other services one could therefore infer that they are in OUR care and as such the government is to blame.

21 Jan 2016 12:39:26pmGerard, the majority appear to be young men from Morocco pretending to be Syrians fleeing mayhem. And Cologne was just the tip of a very ugly iceberg: months ago a "welcome refugees!" event held by a group of young German women on a hired boat turned into a nightmare of sexual assault for the poor naive women. And the police refused to take their complaints seriously! The men are seeking financial and sexual benefits from naive Europeans and are not fleeing mayhem. In a real refugee crisis the vast majority of those fleeing war are women and young children, not fighting aged men as we see in this case. Europeans are finally waking up from the terrible mistake they've made - they were taken for fools - but is it too late?
Alert moderator
21 Jan 2016 2:47:32pmIs it too late?I have family in Germany that I spoke to late December (pre Cologne) and already then they were, to say the least, very concerned with the future of their country. They were of the opinion that If the centre right government don't change policy then a charismatic leader will emerge promising solutions (sound familiar?) Desperate Germans will vote to "stop the madness" and the result will be very ugly indeed. So is it too late? No. Merkel and her coalition government have a few short months to close their borders and restore confidence amongst the native population that they understand the gravity of the situation. If nothing changes before the summer months and the next great migrant wave arrive, it will be too late.

21 Jan 2016 8:17:22pmSame here, my wife has family there. We hesitated initially whether or not we should cancel our long awaited trip to Germany but we had to take our relatives' advice and gave up. Not a good place to visit at the moment especially if you have two teenage daughters.I think anybody who has an urge to comment against the tough Australian immigration policies should speak to some regular Europeans and see how they feel about their current predicament. Don't just read news on Google, talk to some regular people like yourself and see how angry and vulnerable they feel.On the bright side the number of quality, skilled German migrants to Australia will probably increase in the next few years.

21 Jan 2016 9:30:39pmThere are no problems coming to Germany as a tourist.  I would say on the whole it is just as safe as Australia, we moved here 6 months ago with two daughters and have had no issues at all (nothing like anecdotal evidence) ;) .  Not to say this issue is not huge for Germans, and there are changes to  day to day life.  Small changes; my daughter sits next to an Iraqi girl in class, and we arent going to Carnival in Cologne anymore.  But there are no issues as a tourist. I have been amazed at the general change in German openness over my 10 years of visiting, and living in Germany, and there has been a cultural shift...however this 'capital' can be spent very quickly, Germany now has a huge task to match a quite homogeneous culture with such a large mass that do not understand and may not want to.2015 has certainly increased my understanding, and modified my thoughts on Islam.

21 Jan 2016 12:49:39pmOver 1000 human beings died under your Open Border policies. Sarah Hanson Young actually characterized it as "Tragedies happen". There have been a handful of deaths in Mandatory Detention, tragic no doubt, and as a result of less than perfect administration. In a world where you accepted that many souls perishing, your hypocrisy is easily seen here. Australia is leading the world in enforcing its sovereignty. Remember a fine man once articulated the thoughts, hopes and dreams of the majority of the citizens of this country, among them a lot of foreign born immigrants: "WE DECIDE who comes to this country, and the CIRCUMSTANCES in which they come". This stance made it possible for Australia to accept without nary a squeak of disagreement, 12,000 humans from Syria who are true refugees. I'm proud of that and the way this nation treats all immigrants to this nation as equal under law.

21 Jan 2016 2:58:39pmYou're so brainwashed- we are letting in 200,000 migrants every year- mainly because they have money.

21 Jan 2016 11:37:35pmWhat a load.  Firstly, you may mean asylum seekers.  Until assessed and determined, they are not refugees.  Eg, barely any refugees died at sea under the ALP.  Over 1000 asylum seekers did though.  Less are dying at sea.  Hundreds less per year.  The number of people in detention keeps on getting lower and lower (except for those that refuse to leave).  We are also accepting more that ever.  But its not self selected or selected through criminal groups.  Is this what you are really against?I know many are loosing millions per year due to the carnage at sea being stopped.

21 Jan 2016 11:31:19am"The collusion of the authorities and media in the decision that the public could not be trusted with knowledge of what happened in Cologne - and, perhaps even more damningly - that asylum-seekers' involvement was so dangerous to German social cohesion that their presence had to be edited out of the official record"To me this is the most damaging thing to come out of the whole debacle.  The actions of the young men was predictable: we saw the same in the years leading up to Cronulla.  Anyone not deluded by the myth that all these young men were not in search of the good life and had no intention of adapting their lifestyle would have seen it coming. But the decision to hide the truth from the citizens of Germany was, as the author states, reminiscent of an authoritarian state.  It was also predictable however, as the ruling elite do not want the mob to be alarmed by facts. We are never told the real statistics about crime, unemployment etc in the uninvited migrant area. Let alone how much it costs.  Instead we get front page photos of smiling families expressing gratitude.  No mention of how rare such groups might be.Please don't get me wrong.  I am completely for Australia's refugee program, and in fact would like to see it increased.  But to allow anyone who wants to come here a free pass is a recipe for disaster, as Europe shows to anyone with eyes and ears.The interesting questions are: Where are the calls for transparency?  Where are the vociferous denunciations of official silence? The demands for full information?  The cries for heads to roll for keeping the truth from voters?To decide on issue we need the facts.  So why not let us know how many hospitals we could have built and run for the cost of the failed Rudd/Gillard experiment in open borders?  We can then make an informed decision on whether we should relax the control we have managed to put on self selected migrants.

We've spent over a million dollars a head a year in some cases keeping refugees in offshore jails, something like 95% of whom are eventually allowed in. You call that value for money? We paid for these jails to be built overseas in record time, while as you say our own hospitals could do with some help.Merkel is playing the long game but she is right - migrants are an economic and social good.

21 Jan 2016 11:40:59amWhen people talk about the problems of migration, the costs and benefits of migration, they tend to take a personal view based on their personal feelings of their past interactions with migrants. This being a narrow individual experience, it has nothing to do with an objective observation of interaction between large groups of people. Now there are three Core Issues behind the problem of Muslim Migrants in Germany if you want to look at this problem objectively from a perspective of Politcal Economy of Race Relations. Firstly, is the Relationship between the ordinary Native Germans and the German State officials (including the politicians, public servants, judges and police). Secondly, is the Relationship between the German State officials and  the Muslim Migrants as a whole. And thirdly, is the relationship between ordinary Native Germans and the Muslim Migrants as a whole. Each of these relationships is not the same, each has a different quality, and moving along a different axis. For example, there is no doubt that the more Muslim Migrants settle permanently in Germany, the more damage will occur in relationships among the Germans themselves. The more hostile will relationship become between the German State officials as against the ordinary Native Germans. The question now is where is the Breaking Point in the relationship between the State officials and the ordinary German citizen? Where and when will the ordinary Germans see their State officials as a bunch of criminal conspirators against the people, a foreing occupying force, by no means acting as democratic representatives of the German people? Obviously the arrival of one million Muslim Migrants didn't happen in such way as to make them look as welcome guests. Simply because there was no democratic referendum, no democratic decision, no universal approval of German people allowing this tremendous change in all their social relationships, be it at work, in public libraries, in schools, on public transports or in their neighbourhoods. Also, the better relationship between the State officials and the Muslim Migrants develops, the worse is the relationship between the Native Germans and the German officials likely to become. Since all nations live under some form of economic limits or scarcity, the more economic rights are given to the migrants, the more welfare migrants actually get from the State, the more strict the rules and entitlements for German citizens are likely to become. The worse will they feel about their own social rights and benefits. This is quite natural and inevitable.

21 Jan 2016 12:54:33pmIndeed. Especially when the a blind eye is turned as migrants are allowed to get away with horrific attacks on women but when the locals protest they get water cannons pointed at them. Dismissing objecters as "far right" has no credibility any more.Had this not come to light there would have been nothing done about it. These attacks will only get worse as it becomes clear there will be no adverse consequences for the perpetrators...while the victims have a lifetime to have to try and come to terms with what has happened to them and their country.How long before the infidel Cologne cathedral is reduced to rubble?

21 Jan 2016 11:43:26amMerkel's approach, has a hint of socialist politics about it.  We will take these people in, we can help them and provide for them, we have the capacity to do that.   And that in one sense works in theory, in practice, it is much harder, people need to learn language - they need to retrained for jobs - they need money for accommodation and food.   The practical things are what take time - money and there are no quick solutions to such issues.   Among these people from war torn areas, they have a different view on life, they will do what it takes to survive.  As well you have criminals amongst them, so it becomes, can her government handle the negative underbelly of mass migration from a conflict zone.   It all comes down to law enforcement must be allowed to,  enforce the rule of law.   If law enforcement are held back, then society will quickly turn against the government, then there will be a real crisis.  The issue of petty crime - people not getting jobs because refugees take them - services can't handle the numbers calling for their services - are all areas funded and managed by government.   And if government fails to meet these challenges, as the number of people accessing those services, will overwhelm them, then you will also get social unrest in the groups that have flooded into the country.   These people could be accommodated had it been a controlled effort and people were spread all over the EU, but to flood into one country they choose, may be too much for authorities to handle.  to help and to be kind, is human nature, but to take on and mange a large group of people all with different needs and ability, may be too much to handle.   And Merkel will soon find out in the opinion pols if her policies are working or not.

21 Jan 2016 3:04:08pmPolitical correctness underpinned the banning of identification of the ethnic origin of those who commit crime or are welfare dependant. It is hard not to conclude that this high handed censorship was inspired by a knowledge that ordinary Australian voters would not be as easy to manipulate if the facts about decisions made on their behalf are disclosed. As a Labor voter from Western Sydney and the only Tony Abbot policy I agree with is the closing down of people smuggling in to Australia. Labor's capture by the politically correct open borders to people smuggler's clients interest group was seriously damaging to electoral prospects. It is sad that many in the Labor Party have remained silent on this issue out of fear of nasty illogical accusations of racism.

21 Jan 2016 1:06:36pm"If not compassion, then what". It's not either-or, but rather the order of analysis.The first step is dispassionate analysis. Then we apply compassion. Allowing compassion and other emotions during the analysis creates biases and ignores important avenues for analysis. Basic systems analysis should have told Merkel that by opening the doors to refugees, she was creating a positive feed-back loop - an unstable design that was bound to fail.The root problem we need to solve is not refugees, but rather nations and movements that violate or ignore basic laws and human rights. Providing asylum for refugees makes us feel good, but is very expensive, and helps just a few. Solving the refugee problem requires putting in place a credible, international justice and enforcement system in place. Credible enough to deal impartially with Western lawlessness as well.The author states that "Democracy on internationalist terms is impossible. The nation-state remains the only true arena for the pursuit of democratic politics." but fails to justify and otherwise ignores this ignores this crucial issue. The West doesn't really want to solve the refugee crisis.  Our endless debates about what to do with asylum seekers is a red herring, even a deliberate tactic to avoid discussing the real solutions.

Aid agencies and migration is not going to solve this problem but it seems that it is not politically correct to even mention this issue anymore. Some say that climate change is the main issue but they forget that the addition of nearly 5 billion people on earth since 1945 and rising is not a problem?

21 Jan 2016 9:07:22pmHowever there is reason to hope.  The birthrates in many "developing" countries have dropped significantly in recent decades.  In Bangladesh it's now only 2.2 per woman and in Botswana (admittedly considered to be doing well economically and in governance) it's  2.6.  In the state of Kerala in India it's just 1.8 and in India as a whole it was 2.5 in 2012 and is expected to be at replacement level by 2020.  It seems that  people everywhere firstly want their children to be educated and have the best future possible, which is initially expensive, and secondly when they see that  they don't have to have 10 children to ensure 2 survive, they limit their fertility.

21 Jan 2016 6:03:57pmSwedish law takes an impressively wide definition where any sexual act without explicit consent is considered non-consensual. But that's not the only difference: it also records every rape allegation as a separate crime, meaning that an abusive partner can be charged with literally hundreds of assaults.Japan, conversely, has historically been loath to prosecute sexual crimes. In 2000 their Justice Research Ministry Group concluded that only about 11 per cent of sexual assaults were reported to police, while the Tokyo Rape Centre reckons it's about twice that. Proving rape is exceptionally difficult in Japan (until surprisingly recently only an assault by a stranger could be considered rape), most cases are settled out of court, and convictions are rare. So the low rate is less a reflection of an enlightened society unmuddied by immigration, and more an artefact of a legal system struggling to take violence against women seriously.And it's not hard to find other countries with remarkably - some might accurately say "implausibly" - low rates of sexual assault. For example, Nauru officially has no rapes or sexual assaults at all at the moment.Sure, there's all sorts of horrifying reports of both - indeed, the "Abyan" case has made Australia uncomfortably aware of just how prevalent it is - but as the nation's Justice Minister David Adeang has made clear, claims of rape and sexual assault are being made by women trying to make the government look bad, and he has threatened to charge those who have reported being raped with "making false complaint". Nothing brings a crime rate down like angrily denying that there's crime, or having police that actively refuse to investigate it.

21 Jan 2016 11:49:36am"... ultimately treats the nation-state as a thing of the past." in line with the global tendency towards globalization.In the context of globalization, the real failure, "of course," is a failure of cooperation to solve the crises than create refugees.   It is a failure of the United Nations but not the fault of the specific entity we called the United Nations; in the case of Syria the intransigence and self-interests of China and Russia, with their veto powers, being the case in point.Much as there is good in Malcolm Turnbull's recent speech in the US to cover Australia's refusal for more assistance he did say something dumb.  It being that Syria has to fix its own problems.  Why are we there at all then and how does a people dominated by an unreasonable government sort its own problems out?  It is all very well to refuse assistance on the basis that we are doing reasonably enough and it is all very well to expect the Syrians to get together to reform the country when the conditions are right and that may be what he meant.  However, to put it the way Turnbull did is to condemn the Syrian people to tyranny and a retreat from globalization.On the other hand, globalization was always more about big corporate profits than compassion wasn't it?

21 Jan 2016 11:51:40amGiven that the people that have claimed refugee status are not often true refugees I feel that Germany, and many other countries in Europe are now worried that their values are going to trashed.They will be forced to accept the migrants value systems and way of life.Like it or not.Look at Indonesia. They accept the migrants (and by the UN definition they are not refugees by the way) that want to transition to Australia. However now that the migrants are not allow to freely move through to Australia they are having issues in their own country.As a refugee I was in a camp for several years awaiting a new place to live.The camp though was far better than I was living at my home country as I was not persecuted at all.Those that are in Australian run camps by comparison are living a better life than many in other camps around the world.Maybe we should have the places for people to be at the same level of services that the UNHCR supply. And we accept people after the UNHCR has processed them.For the Cologne problem though. Very few are new migrants and the previous years have had the same problems with females being molested.

21 Jan 2016 3:07:24pmI think an acceptable solution is to house them in camps in neighboring countries.  The world community should contribute more money for those camps so they are safe for women and children.The world should then take the country by force and rebuild it.  A country in a civil war cannot compete with a world army.  Then the country should be rebuilt with a mix of world money and manpower from the camps.  A forced government needs to exist until stability is clearly there.Of course that is a fantasy as there are too many people playing politics and certain countries refuse to give me to the problem.  But in my opinion it solves the issue of economic migrants pushing in front of real refugees and it ensures the conflict is taken care of instead of sitting back while women and children are slaughtered daily.

21 Jan 2016 12:36:44pmGJA, not only has the "liberal" media attempted to minimise the crimes committed in Cologne, they have deliberately covered up thousands of other similar crimes. Sweden is the classic example of media censorship....the rape rate has increased 1300% since the 1980's, yet the authorities in conjunction with the media, do not report this. They refuse to state the ethnic origin of the attackers. This also happened in Rotherham, England, where 1400 underage girls were systematically raped and trafficked within a community over a period of 20 years. Yet authorities said nothing, as they did not want to inflame racial tensions.These girls are being sacrificed on the altar of political correctness. This is perverse and indefensible. The "liberal" media should take a new approach to reporting these crimes, as they too are guilt of inflicting more injustice upon the female victims.

21 Jan 2016 11:58:05amHow will the 1.1 million people who have recently sought asylum become German? The answer is that the majority of them will not become German in any way other than what may end up being written on their passports. The German experience is a perfect example for Australia not to follow. The wolves were at their door and they threw open that door with "WillKommen, come in, all are welcome" and the result is that German women are significantly less safe than before and in a society that has shunned weapons for the past 70 years people, particularly women, are arming themselves to the teeth with whatever they can buy, if indeed they can buy because everyone else is buying as well.

21 Jan 2016 12:43:41pmsidlaw, I've spent a fair bit of time in various parts of Germany, primarily Munich, over the last three years and I can assure you that the average German citizen is furious at Merkel's actions and is vehemently opposed to the unregulated, unmonitored and unchecked inflow of people claiming to be Syrian. I have seen Senegalese, Eritreans, Afghanis and other nationalities all claiming to be "fleeing Syrian persecution" and I can tell you that the local population won't accept this situation for much longer. The owner of the restaurant a few doors down from my hotel told me that his business was down by three-quarters because people could not (or would not) step over and around the people sleeping in his doorway.The unauthorised entrants are bleeding the system dry, with the German authorities going so far as to put piles of blankets and sleeping bags on the streets with "Help Yourself" signs, putting free food stalls at the stations and free transport. At the stations the usual buses and airport shuttle services have been taken over for the illegal entrants, and taxi drivers refuse to go anywhere near the railway stations. It took me five hours to get from central Munich to the airport, usually a short bus trip.The Muslim men make an extreme point of being Muslim by walking three abreast along the footpath and forcing women, my wife amongst them, off the footpath and into the traffic. There is no attempt to assimilate, become German or to adopt western standards.What's more, Merkel is causing great distress in the countries adjoining Germany. Hungary has been forced to erect razor wire fences to prevent illegal entry, Croatia has closed almost all border crossings, Slovenia now has only one crossing open, and it is guarded by the military, and Montenegro, a country of less than 700,000 inhabitants has been confronted with 10,000 illegal arrivals at its borders every month.To misuse the old phrase, it is just a tinder box, and sooner rather than later there is going to be a conflagration.

21 Jan 2016 12:06:08pmNo no no. Just no. This has got nothing to do with being "compassionate" or "soft" or any other wooly or irrational response. It is entirely rational. It is about being practical, it is about meeting international legal obligations and it is about upholding Europe's founding principles. People talk about the refugee crisis as if there are simple choices. There are currently approximately 50 million refugees in the world. It is the biggest refugee crisis since the end of WW2.There are people willing to risk their lives to come to escape war to come to Europe. Their desire to escape is greater than Europe's desire to stop them no matter how tough governments want to get.How exactly do people propose stopping them? By force? How much force are we prepared to use on innocent men, women and children? Water guns? Guns? Should we build walls around Europe? What? How far are we prepared to go?And what about the fact that society doesn't like to hear about yucky things like locking up innocent men, women and children. So then like in good old Australia governments have restrict the freedom of the press lest anyone reports on any of these horrendous conditions. So we start on the slippery slope. Everything we stand for and everything our grandfathers fought for gets trampled in a desperate attempt to stop men, women and children fleeing persecution. Wow how brave we all are.And still they come. Because anything we do to them is better than getting your head chopped off by ISIS, it is better than seeing your wife and children being raped, it is better than the hell they are escaping. The hell that we have played a part in creating. And yes some of them will be criminals and terrorists. In fact having experienced what they have experienced there is an increasing likelihood that they could be criminals and terrorists. And yes anyone who has travelled in these parts of the world will know that there are serious issues with sexism, that women get leered at and approached in a completely unacceptable way.This is thing about the Cologne attacks. What exactly are we suppose to do? They are coming whether we like it or not, a very small minority (tiny in fact) committed horrendous acts but we still cannot send them back to where they might be tortured or murdered. So what do we do? Well we could just do what we would do with any other rapists and put them in prison.  This idea that people who are calling for "something to be done" about refugees are in some way being rational is nonsense. It is a response which is being driven by fear, ignorance and prejudice. It is completely irrational, completely irresponsible and doing nothing whatsoever to help the situation.

21 Jan 2016 12:35:11pmWhat you have written is what people used to say and write about asylum seekers coming to Australia by boat before the Rudd2/Abbott policies came into effect, FormerGuardianReader. It was said that they would never stop coming in large numbers no matter what Australia did, they said massive amounts of violence was going to be needed or used, they said that the only way to stop them was to kill them, etc, etc. In the end the arrivals were stopped and with not even close to what was predicted as being necessary. Europe can also stop their arrivals if they wish to do so. All they have to do is deny the asylum seekers any chance of getting what they want. Doubtlessly there are plenty of countries willing to take asylum seekers from Europe in exchange for plenty of Euros and I doubt that there are many asylum seekers willing to pay thousands to a people smuggler in order to just end up in Africa.

It's worked out so well that nobody actually knows what we can do about these people that we have locked up indefinitely. What's the long term plan people?

The money (in fact far more money) would have been spent if we had continued doing what was done during the Gillard government. The Gillard policies cost a little less than twice what the Abbott policies cost. Yes,  they are going to stay on Nauru or in PNG forever. That is what "resettled in Nauru and PNG" means.

21 Jan 2016 12:37:11pm'it is about meeting international legal obligations'.

It does not require us to give permanent asylum to anyone merely because they come from a war zone which is what the majority of these recent 'refugees' is exploiting.You seem to dismiss the serious issues of 'refugee' sourced terrorism and rape as an inevitable evils Europe just has to 'suck up' in pursuit of justice for those terrorist and rapists.'So what do we do'?  Lock them up after their crimes?  No.  Detain them until they prove themselves to be who they are.

21 Jan 2016 1:19:47pmStop lying to yourself. Australia is in breach of international law. It does not matter which mode of transport is used. Australia has obligations to take in refugees and process them accordingly. You cannot lock people up on an island indefinitely, not process them and inform them that they will never come to Australia. So we have a new concept now. "Refugee sourced terrorism and rape". That sounds scary. The thing about living in a liberal democracy, it involves sacrifice. For example, the threshold for finding someone guilty of a criminal offence is set very high: beyond reasonable doubt. As a result lots of murderers and rapists walk free. We as a society have made the decision that it is the lesser of two evils to allow a murderer to walk free if there is any doubt as to his or her guilt than to take away an innocent person's freedom. If you think about it, that fundamental concept is incredibly brave. We are willing to place the interests of justice above those of the victim. Now should we not to apply those same principles to the millions of refugees escaping persecution? What is the percentage you are prepared to live with? What percentage of genuine, law abiding, decent refugees should suffer because of a small handful of scumbags? The irony of Australia looking on in shock and outrage at the incidents in Cologne while turning a blind eye to countless incidents of rape on Manus and Nauru is truly disturbing. Which is worse: helping people who turn out to be rapists or sending innocent people to be raped on an island? Australia is in no position to judge while it continues to support and condone breaches of human rights.

21 Jan 2016 2:23:47pmSo exactly who is committing the rape on Manus island and Nauru? In Germany following WWII many Jews actually flooded back into Germany as this was the only country accepting them. Camps were set up containing tens of thousands of people. Some at the location of former POW & concentration camps, a situation they must have found rather uncomfortable. These refugees (actual refugees, not economic refugees) established schools, shops, medical facilities, etc.. They lived like civilized people until they were eventually resettled, usually in about 4-5 years. Look it up.What I am trying to say is that all cultures are not equal. Those committing the rapes are the same ones that you want to let in. And yes there are innocent victims, just as there has always been and always will be. But are YOU willing to have YOUR way of life changed to help them? This might sound a bit harsh but would you rather have them rape on of their daughters or rape your daughter?

21 Jan 2016 2:39:25pmFGR true there is international law for refugees.However these people are not refugees. These people are economic migrants.For example if you had to flee Perth because of persecution you would normally stop at the first safe place you could and then apply for asylum. If you have to travel all the way to Sydney then you should be addressing the problems of persecution to all the places along the way that will not allow the "refugees" to stop and be assessed.Let me see you standing in front of the Indian commission or the Indonesian embassy protesting about how they treat the refugees in their country before you start casting stones at what we are doing.I do not know of many Australians that can access $10,000 and those that can are in the wealthy group.If they are looking for a new life and are offered one in a country that accepts them then they should take it. If they do not then they should be returned to their country of birth and not cherry pick. We have enough issues supporting our elderly and youth without more drain on our resources.However if you are prepared to give up all you have for a migrant then go for it but do not ask for any government assistance if you doing this humanitarian deed

True for some, but by Germany's own admission as many as one third are not syrian, but, rather, falsely claiming to be syrian. Many are from Morocco and various North African States, This does not discount the fact that two thirds are escaping war however, it is not true to characterise the current migrants as exclusively people felling war (particularly given that it seems likely that many of the Cologne trouble makers were those impersonating syrians).   "innocent men women and children" There certainly is innocent men women and children amongst the refugees but one of the reasons why Germany is having issues is because there are a disproportionate amount of young men. Characterising the group as men women and children belies the issues with the demographics of the new arrivals. Finally, you talk of rationality and practicality. How  is the German response rational or even more unlikely practical in any way? the rush of migrants in response to Merkel's invite has been disorderly, dangerous for the migrants and ultimately, as the paris attacks and Cologne violence attest, dangerous for the host countries. Further, the way in which the german leadership, law enforcement and some sections of the media have handled the situation has been deplorable.

21 Jan 2016 8:56:35pmAlpo, they are very different circumstances. Post WW2 there was massive migration in societies on the rebound with enormous demand for unskilled and skilled labor, in short lots of opportunities to be useful, to want to integrate, start a family etc. The situation in Germany and Europe at the moment is anything but. The economy is in crisis, the continent is overpopulated, lethargic and disillusioned with great wealth inequality. There are very little opportunities for unskilled migrants to gain wealth, stability and integration when the locals are increasingly struggling to make ends meet. Whatever work opportunities were there were picked up by the eastern Europeans who have already been migrating in great numbers for a couple of decades now. Skilled and unskilled alike.Powder keg anyone? And I predict the initial conflicts will be between the eastern European "Volkdeutsche" and the non-Europeans newcomers. There is no coincidence that most attacks on migrant shelters happen in Eastern Germany or that the "hero" of Cologne and his ganged made of Eastern Europeans started bashing up mid-eastern looking passers by on the streets of Koln days after the NYE events.

22 Jan 2016 12:23:37pmALA Voter,Germany already has more than one million immigrants from Turkey and in the past they hosted very many immigrants from Southern Europe (many Italians immigrated to Germany to work in their mines, for instance). Immigrants stay there, accumulate the wealth they are after, through their hard work, and many return to their native country. Some years ago I was visiting Serbia and was shown the houses built around Belgrade by the Serbian migrants to Germany. They returned when they had made the money they were after.Some immigrants stay, of course, and just add to the social diversity of a country (see good examples in Australia, US, UK, etc.).I agree that the economic turmoil Europe has been going through since the GFC has made the employment situation for the locals difficult. That's why very many young Europeans migrated (to Australia, US, Canada, NZ, etc.). But the economic situation in Europe is turning around, and they will need the manpower to get their economy going. If the local manpower is not enough, immigration is inevitable.But one may ask: Why accept asylum seekers? Why not go through a more traditional program of immigration? Well, in the case of Syria, accepting asylum seekers is not a bad idea. Syria is losing very many well educated, well trained people who are fleeing. They should be considered an asset, not a drag on any host society.... the humanitarian aspect is almost a bonus!

21 Jan 2016 1:02:45pmFrom an economic pragmatic point of view, cheap labour and economic opportunity - see 19th and early 20th century US history.From a international diplomacy point of view, you distinguish yourself from the brutal despots and dictators that you oppose. From a nationalist point of view, national pride. The Brits take a lot of pride from the refuge they provided to the exiles from continental Europe during WW2. From a Christian religious perspective - love thy neighbour. Funnily enough, humans tend to like showing empathy towards others. Who knew?I won't argue that the Germans got it right by taking in so many so quickly. I think they should have done things more slowly and with greater care.But any sort of major change (demographic, fiscal etc) disrupts civil society.

21 Jan 2016 12:12:06pmIslam is a problem - it is a religion of militant intolerance. All religions are defined by their prohibitions, but islam is unique in the developed world of issuing death threats for breaches of their prohibitions. It is an absolutist religion - there is no moderate islam, it's all or nothing. And 'nothing' is known as apostasy and is not well-tolerated, by which I mean it is treated with extreme ostracism or threats of death.I agree that multiculturalism is a stupid idea - I hope that Merkel's Germany can find a way to assimilate its new migrants. Maybe they can find a way to diffuse the urge for migrants to set up the very micro-cultures that have led to the ruination of the countries they are fleeing from. Life around the mosque is not consistent with German values or Western values full stop. Since the Enlightenment the town square is from where our cultures have derived their meaning, not the church and certainly not the mosque. Western values of freedom, democracy, the rule of laws made by human beings, permissiveness, sexual liberation, gay rights, equal rights for women... these are not Islamic ideals.

Western values of freedom... permissiveness... we can stipulate conditions for citizenship..."Most countries do have a citizenship test.But given your earlier comments about Islam, what do you really mean by this?You can be a Muslim German citizen, but you can't condone rape, you must tolerate apostasy, sexual liberation etc? Sounds very reasonable.But given your generalisations of what Islam is all about, no Muslim could ever be a German citizen.So all that stuff about western values of freedom and permissiveness is just a cruel catch 22:German values permits its citizens the freedom to be Muslim. As Islam is inconsistent with German values, you can never really be a German citizen.

When your indoctrinated view of justice demands you have the right and are even obliged to kill other people for their beliefs and harmless behaviours you have a problem.

21 Jan 2016 8:18:35pm"Last I checked, the Catholic Church is opposed to:blah blah blah..."LoC - the difference is that since the Enlightenment the church has been forced to tolerate all these things. The Catholic church might well be unreformed, but Christianity overall is reformed and Western societies that used to be Christian are now secular and take or leave Christian ideals as they fancy, mixed with a bit of New Age claptrap, some astrology and a fair whack of alcohol.Not so Islamic societies or the Islamic faith. I agree we'd be better off without Christianity interfering in our lives, but most people in Australia when looking for a new house do not factor in proximity to a particular church, when looking for new friends do not look for practising Christians, when looking for answers to scientific questions do not reach for the bible, and when learning of their friends' and colleagues' change of mind on religion do not wipe them from their speed-dial and threaten them with violence. New migrants to a country should genuinely swear to put the laws and civic values of their host nation before any of their religion, that's what I mean by 'conditions for citizenship'. Many migrants have sworn this allegiance to their book of nonsense and might find it hard to adjust to regarding rules written by postmodern humans in the legislature to be superior to those written by bronze age humans (while pretending to have been talking to supernatural beings) in a book of make believe. If they cannot make this commitment in goof faith - and be held to it in their everyday behaviour - then they should not seek to remain.I might seek shelter in a storm in a golf club - but nothing would make me want to play a round. As soon as the storm had passed I would thank them for their generous help in a tight spot and be on my way either back to where I had come from or onwards to a pole dancing club similar to the one I had been forced to evacuate in the storm.

22 Jan 2016 1:55:02pmMigrants are one thing. Something that seems to have been left out of much discussions are converts.People that have been raised without Islam who decided to convert to that religion and some will be militants. Australia's most well known example is probably Jake Bilardi, reportedly raised in an atheist household, decided to become a Muslim and went on all the way to becoming a suicide attacker for IS.Having a non-Muslim background and upbringing may ultimately be no barrier to militant Islam.

21 Jan 2016 9:15:48pm"I don't recall the Catholic Church organising throwing homosexuals off roofs..."You should visit Uganda or Russia. The Christian churches of the world have led the ideological charge against homosexuals, and still insist on discriminating against them here in Australia. If Christians were more serious about their religion like muslims are then there would be far more crimes against homosexuals here. I don't know how old you are, but if you grew up in the 1970s or 1980s then you will know from personal experience how people spoke openly of violence against 'pooftas', and how such crimes occurred in the playground, the street and the workplace as a matter of course without any comebacks. Christian churches spoke openly about their disgust with homosexuals. The slippery sophistry of 'love the sinner hate the sin' had not yet been trotted out by the cowardly church to disguise their hatred, like they do today to demonstrate god's infinite love.Christianity and Islam are identical in their hateful, vengeful, homicidal nonsense. The difference isn't between Christianity and islam - the difference is between Christians and Muslims and how they regard their religion. Christians have had maybe 100-years of biblical ridicule rendering the bible little more than a series of metaphorical fables, while Muslims still believe literally everything that is written in the Koran. The Koran is for Muslims what an encyclopaedia is for non-muslims.There is no excusing Christianity - it is as brutal and uncompromising as it ever was. It is our secular society that does not throw homosexuals from roofs. It is our secular rule of law that treat everyone as equal. It is our secular law that regards science as the arbiter of reality rather than an old holy book.

Multiculturalism doesn't translate well to what Angela  means here on our  continent, clearly she doesn't intend on taking the religion out of the refugee.

21 Jan 2016 8:43:17pm"Multiculturalism doesn't translate well to what Angela means here on our continent, clearly she doesn't intend on taking the religion out of the refugee"This is the key issue - the religion does not fit well with German values: ideological sexism, homophobia, and anti-science combined with a contempt for non-islamic laws. There is no way to make these polar-opposites fit. They co-exist when Islamic populations are small and when they feel relatively powerless to assert their views on wider society, but as the populations grow then so do the demands to impose their weird ideas on the rest of the population.Sharia is not a take-it-or-leave-it kind of ideal - it is as absolute as the rest of islam. If Islam were largely neutered like Christianity then this wouldn't be a problem for any but its adherents, but it is not neutered - it is militant. You cannot easily identify as muslim, drink, eat pork, wear what you like and not go to mosque while staying close to your friens and family as you can identify as catholic and use contraceptives, eat Maccas on a Friday and only go to church for weddings and funerals.Compassion for humans is to be lauded and applauded - I agreed with Merkel and felt similarly warm and fuzzy as she welcomed desperate people in desperate circumstances, but what now? What if these people hold Germans people and German values in contempt? What if they view German women as sluts for wearing what they want and the men as morally depraved with their beer drinking and eating Bratwurst? What if they cannot shake the belief that non-muslims are against Islam and are destined for hell? What if the only way they can escape this morally vacant German culture is to set up their own mini-culture by demanding mosques be built so they can live close-by as though not in Germany but back in the kind of  theocracy or pseudo-theocracy from which they came?This is a description of multiculturalism - it's the kind of multiculturalism we have here, and the kind that is not working. Cultural enclaves do not a nation make.

21 Jan 2016 12:14:06pmG'day Matthew.Thanks for your article.  No doubt Germany has acted with admirable motivation.  However, there does seem to be a certain arrogance in imagining that a problem in the Middle East can be solved by masses of people moving elsewhere.  We've got over 7 billion on the planet & 1 billion of them are permanently living in desperate poverty.  Despite a slow-down of percentage growth, each year still sees an increase of more than 83 million.  Could Germany absorb even that number?  Not likely.Sooner or later, the penny will drop:  Humans are in plague.  Anyone genuinely concerned about refugees, global warming, poverty, starvation, disease, social disorder or the welfare of other species, should concentrate all effort towards stabilising, & then reducing our numbers.Those who believe that this will naturally occur through education & a lift in living standards, or that redistribution of people & of resources will do the trick, are either very optimistic or extremely arrogant.We are, however, a species with sufficient knowledge & organisational ability to rationally farm both the planet & ourselves, without bloodshed, if we wished to do so.  I suggest that with modern technology, 2 billion people could live on this little green planet in magnificent peace & prosperity.  When all else fails, no doubt this will be done.  Meanwhile, Germany will have to carry on with the hopeful motto:  "You breed 'em, we feed 'em." Regards,Cobber

Practically, it's complete toss. In some respects it accurately reflects the level of discussion around various strands of this complex topic however, and should be held up as a fine example of the craft whilst simultaneously derided.Taking a variation on the "Why should Australia make the same carbon cuts as everyone else when most of the emissions are overseas" line, I'd be interested in knowing how you propose to try and sell your masterplan."We" live in a country with low population density, well away from the real levels of poverty and disease and starvation and social disorder. As such, in order to get "our" numbers down the majority (if not all) of the "cutting" should be done somewhere else.That requires YOU to hop on a plane, travel to these places, and patiently explain to these people that they need to be the ones to stick their heads in an oven for the greater good of the planet, because "we" aren't the ones who are contributing to the problem. It's a nice, logical, elegant, fact-driven case you'd be putting, and I'd happily drive you to the airport to help you deliver it.Not because I think it'd work; but because I'd really like to see what these people would do to you when you advanced it.Superficial, ridiculous slop is fine in its place - at the front bar of your local at about 11pm for example, but it's really a waste of serious time in a public forum where you're guaranteed to have at least one troublemaker who can think logically.

21 Jan 2016 2:12:36pmG'day Son.When all else fails, the bleeding obvious will be reconsidered.  Perpetual growth is not sustainable.In my humble opinion, Australia is already over-populated to the point of environmental deficit.  Tim Flannery suggested that the point of balance might be around 15 million.  My guess would be closer to 10 million.I'm not trying to sell you anything, old fella, & certainly welcome your views, even though I don't agree with you.  Perhaps if you imagine that Germany had only 2 million residents & sought to take in only 150 refugees, you could see how much easier that would be.  I presume you agree that humans have problems due to our high numbers(?)  However, you appear to be saying that nothing could ever be done to change that.  Do I read you correctly?  If so, what about when all else fails?  When the numbers of starving people rise from current levels of almost a billion to perhaps 3 billion?  Still no ideas?  No suggestions?  No possibilities?What about if Australia reaches 100 million, with 3 million starving?  No opinion?  Not concerned about other species?  Environmental degradation?   Global warming? Fair enough.  Can we at least agree to disagree, without too many bitter words?  I hope so.Regards,Cobber

21 Jan 2016 3:06:16pm"Do I read you correctly?"No, you don't.My point was a perfectly sensible one (at least I thought so), and I haven't gone anywhere near the carrying capacity argument on purpose just to keep it simple.You stated a problem (problems actually) AND offered up a solution ("...stabilising, & then reducing our numbers").I'm explaining to you that your "solution" is meaningless theorising because, at core, it (a) involves disparate human beings agreeing to do something that reduces their footprint/perceived viability as a species sub-group (which goes against the most basic instincts of human beings as practiced and perfected since the days of Lucy), and (b) your "reduction" strategy has no global currency.The notion that you can set population quotas for continents and nations could only have come from someone living in the comparative unreality of a continent which is also a country - elsewhere wars get started when countries within continents start making decisions about what happens on those continents.Any talk of "reduction" is also fundamentally meaningless even beyond the small and insignificant (irony by the way) problem of whether we need an across-the-board reduction or whether certain nations have to own up they're more of a problem and thus will need to provide more of the solution, and that's down simply to the first and most obvious retort that "if there's too many here, and too few there, then lets just move those here to there". Try getting that considered anywhere the "too few" brigade reside. I wish you luck.In short, I commented to the effect that you really shouldn't have bothered commenting. Bitter words never entered into it.

Alert moderator
21 Jan 2016 9:46:57pmYou are the voice of reason, Keith.I don't think compassion is the primary motivation of either German or Australian political leaders in accepting refugees. Rather, population growth is their concern, because as was noted here often during debate around 'Big Australia' that is fundamentally what keeps the wheels of capitalism turning. It increases property prices and rent; taxation revenue; consumption of goods and services; and all the other things that help the rich and powerful along. It creates competition for jobs that helps keep wages low, which further maximises profits. It breeds desperation and impoverishment, which makes people afraid to rock the boat. It provides opportunity for the poor to get into business themselves with new opportunities opening up, which entices their subscription.Compassion is just another tool here to get people to go along with the grander scheme of increasing the number of sheep to shear. It works best in this situation if, like the divine edict to go forth and multiply, it trumps all reason - if the herd can be convinced that to follow the mandate is to exhibit moral superiority, or to be unarguably 'good' by nature. (Do I hear "Four legs good, two legs bad!")It is indeed right-wing motivation behind immigration policy - so-called 'economic rationalism'. And those who do bleat the bleat are complicit with them, which makes their leftist qualities questionable as well. Little surprise that refugee advocates are often religiously minded as well, this is one of the key indicators of being conservative at heart. What we have here is really the typical feudal society in operation, with the elites laying out the line to toe, and all their slaves and sycophants filing along this path.I agree with you. Reproduction is a choice. If we so chose as a collective, we could have the human population at any level we wish within a single generation. The biodiversity would breathe a sigh of relief if we gave nature some breathing space, and a sustainable population could live so well according to modern scientific knowledge. It is a great dream to which we might aspire.The Big Australia debate should be restarted. Australia could set an example of how well people can live when population is small in relation to the availability of resources. Upon seeing the good example, others would surely follow suit.

21 Jan 2016 1:27:36pmNot true according to research on Muslim migrants to the UK, which found that second and third generations were LESS assimilated and more likely to identify with fundamentalist religion and culture than with their host country. So it doesn't always turn out the way you predict.
Alert moderator
21 Jan 2016 3:13:40pmmike, that sounds well and good but you might want to share what the research was.A 2nd or 3rd generation migrants, by definition, face no integration problems. That's where they were born and they only know Hull KR and Watney's Red Barrel. There might well be problems but you'll need a different name for them other than integration. There might be a case to make that subsequent generations choose to identify with some kind of austere, puritanical version of Islam that their parents were either fleeing or probably didn't even practice themselves. That's normal. I've been to weddings with kilts and pipes in Australia and no-one was actually from Scotland. Someone just fancied the whole heritage thing. Many recent generations of African Americans have chosen traditional over slave names for their kids. In a young man's search for identity I can appreciate the finding roots, retro, reclaim the culture, especially when one is a minority. Good luck to them. But they themselves are a minority within a minority. Look at mosque attendances and the demographics therein. Most young Muslim men have a far greater interest in cars, sport, girls and beer and reciting the Qur'an or listening to some fringe cleric tell them that they deserve more than a hostile world has given them

Easy prey for militant numpties who have no respect for outsiders and only want to use them to do what they cannot or, more likely, will not do - sacrifice their own lives for some purpose they presumably don't dare to even question.  There'd be others who convert for love - probably fairly safe from the predators.  Are there any other reasons to adopt such a faith?

In an affluent western society they are much more likely to be overridden by the western culture and values but in any traditional society with scarce resources, women generally and virginity in particular has a great value. Its been around for hundreds of thousands of years. The more affluent a society is the less likely is that women will be seen purely as an asset.

21 Jan 2016 12:43:12pm"The nation-state remains the only true arena for the pursuit of democratic politics." This is a challenge for the 21st century for all freedom loving democrats. The nation state is vitally important to the freedom of the individual. The Western Left has long since abandoned this principle and with its Open Borders position it seeks to create a government of the world via the UN. The UN, in the thrall of the OiC is actually anti-Democratic as we see countries like Saudi Arabia chair Human Rights while they segregate and enslave their women, and Iran advocates for the rights of children while they allow Paedophiles to legally interfere with 9 year old girls under the banner of Islamic law. Countries like China, Russia and India act unilaterally and thus affect greater change for the individuals in their countries. Those that want to group think the problems of humanity and not allow for ingenuity of the individual consign us to totalitarianism under the guise of "Compassion"

21 Jan 2016 12:48:03pmThere is an extraordinary wealth imbalance in today's world.  Importing the poor in large numbers can only be a short term solution.   A better long term solution is to help the impoverished nations to achieve some economic prosperity - genuine help, not the farce that is foreign aid. We have become a global world  and we can no longer  successfully maintain gated  communities for the wealthy. The  relatively poor now have the capability at least getting to our fences and sometimes even cutting through them.  The 3 wise monkeys solution will no longer work. It will take some time for us to accept this , but we will get there eventually. It's the economy, Stupid.

This included their own people - not just "other" refugees. Lots of people lacked any place to live.Refugees are a long term game, not a short term one. It is always hard. But there are long term rewards also ... remember the positive change of the Vietnamese here? Trying to change it into a short term one is ... folly. Those who come are determined that their children succeed - and that is the true heritage of refugees. Germany will have short term costs - and long term success.

Hardly a moment goes by without a Muslim group attacking and killing someone somewhere so they can impose Sharia. The frequency of events says the events are not unusual but are in fact normal.When this is occurring everywhere Islam exists it says something about the fundamentals of the belief system itself, its not the fundamentalists, its the fundamentals that are the problem.Look at this kid in Pakistan who chopped his own hand off, what sort of crap has been fed into that kids head for all of his life to even consider it? Eternal reward in paradise perhaps?If thats how Muslims treat themselves, how do you think they would treat other people who might offend a belief system powerful enough to make someone amputate his own limb?

21 Jan 2016 1:09:47pmThanks for an thoughtful article.Merkel's words on multiculturalism and the thoughts of the French philosopher are of particular interest.Multiculturalism doesn't necessarily have the same meaning for everyone. Some apparently feel it refers to certain groups within a community permanently adhering  to cultural beliefs and practices not found in the wider society.(Almost a support for a "mini nation" co-existing within the original country.) Others may see multiculturalism as a reasonable acceptance of some initial cultural differences, but with an expectation that immigrants will conform with the "basics" by learning the national language, accepting the legal/political system, the separation of religion and state and so on.The latter might also have an expectation that immigrants and particularly their descendants, will "assimilate" by marrying  others outside the migrant community, regardless of religious/cultural differences. - ie a "great big melting pot."The French philosopher doesn't seem to spell it out, but supporters of "open borders" or similar approaches to refugee immigration might have more in common with totalitarianism than they know. While there are often strident demands for protection and preservation of immigrant cultural differences, there is usually little corresponding respect for preserving the culture of the nation being entered. Migrants with a very strong "religious identity" living in  secular democracies may present unique issues. Cultures which have such entrenched views on women's social significance that they feel (as some did in the  Victorian era) it's necessary to cover female bodies either in part or completely, may have difficulties.Those favouring an immigrant "toxic victim ideology"  - criticised by some Australian muslims such as Mohammed El-leissey -  perhaps display a destructive aspect of allegedly tolerant, liberal humanitarianism.Have a good one.

21 Jan 2016 1:17:20pmThe nation state may be the only political entity that can serve as the arena of democratic politics, but if the world's countries cannot look beyond their borders to encompass a global whole the world situation will only worsen.Nothing that has been done in Europe has got to the fundamental problem behind the refugee flows, although Angela Merkel's compassion is far superior to Australia's xenophobia.The Australian solution has appeared to work because of accidents of geography. It is inhumane, immoral and unethical to systematically discriminate against a whole class of displaced persons for political ends - and to in effect torture them as a deterrent.All of the strategies to cope with refugee numbers are stop gap and temporary solutions because the basic push factors are never sufficiently addressed.Not unless and until the global community can stem the intolerably high levels of strife, poverty, sectarian violence, and racism will a true solution be found.From every direction a plethora of symptoms point to the necessity for a restructuring of the global economic and social system so that everyone has a place at the table, and feels included in a just social system. Clearly this is a massive challenge.It may sound idealistic, but actually it is quite pragmatic.Globalized capitalism has virtually destroyed the worldwide economy, endangered the planet's environment, and created a refugee problem not seen since the last world war.Constructive change is necessary. And an increase in awareness is necessary to make this possible.

Including, and perhaps especially, the countries from which many refugees flee. Many australians are either migrants themselves, or the children of migrants. The well meaning but totally misguided refugee policies of the Greens have been overwhelmingly rejected by an australian electorate which includes muslims, hindus, buddhists, christians, bahai'i etc., and people from just about every nation on earth.The very same allegedly "xenophobic" multi-racial electorate which is willing to accept 12,000 (at least) unfortunate Syrians.

21 Jan 2016 2:25:18pm1.  Multiculturalism is incompatible with large scale migration.  Because it gives migrants greater rights to retain the culture of their society, than it gives locals the right to retain the culture of their society.  Without immigration multiculturalism is a perfectly valid choice, but it's cultural martyrdom when combined with large scale immigration.2.  Compassion, or the empathy one champions, is not infinite.  In a finite world compassion has limits, and it has opportunity costs attached.  In the case of the influx to Europe, there opportunity costs take the form of leaving women and girls to rot, prioritising refugees with means ahead of those without, robbing groups like Daesh from people to oppose them, and limiting the compassion of Europeans in the future, by expending so much treasure (and borrowed treasure) now.3.  If the refugee convention didn't exist, and it was proposed now, almost everyone would be against signing it, on the grounds of fairness.  Why should a refugee who makes it to your border have greater rights than a refugee who doesn't?  Why should those with means and arrogance be prioritised over their humbler and poorer rivals?  Why should we create a scheme which favours men over women?  A scheme which lures people to their deaths with rewards.  If the Refugee Convention was proposed now, even the Greens would be opposed to it.4.  The gender imbalance is a demographic nightmare, and a direct result of letting migrants/refugees self select.  Self selection is a surrender of control (and values).  In the case of Germany, which received a million migrants in 2015, 73% or so being male, this amounts to around half a million more males than females.  Which places a large burden on progressive women in Germany, who need to take one (or several) for the team, in order to prevent a surge in sexual violence toward women.  By opening their legs as well as their hearts, to the needs of the male dominated migration flow which they champion. Of course it could be worse, it's only 2 or 3 males for every woman that is arriving in Europe.  When Labor was last in power, there were 6 males for every female who arrived by boat in Australia.  If you didn't know this, blame the media, which bombards us with images of women and children, so as to deliberately misinform, and manipulate public opinion. Fortunately the boats were stopped, and this demographic disaster for Australia was curtailed.  Irrespective of your position on asylum seekers, stopping such a male centric migration flow should be considered good policy.What Europe is doing may be viewed as compassionate by some, but it's also an unmitigated disaster on many fronts.

Germany has a leadership role in keeping the EEC together as well as financially unifying Europe with a common currency, but the terrorist attack in Paris and media exposure of violent dissent within polarised Franco-Arab fringe communities has given some political leadership back to France and has also given opportunist clarity to the European right wing argument for control of immigration which it has to be remembered was principally intended to fill a need for unskilled workers for Germany's industries much as it was for Italy and France. The onus is now on Europe as it is for any other country accepting multicultural communities to have a duty of care. The argument about conformity and patriotic indoctrination was a pointless one from the start, once the invitation is given and the door is opened you have accepted who comes in baggage and all.

Then there is the identity politics left. Or regressive left. Great defenders of the highly conservative Islamic religion.

21 Jan 2016 2:58:07pmA number of European leaders have now come out against multiculturalism or said that it has failed. The difficulties seem to be in the numbers, and the cultural baggage of the immigrants.Too many immigrants makes it difficult to absorb them, especially if their culture is one that favours isolation from Western values in the first place. Merkel was extremely foolish to allow so many to pour into Germany; that they were mainly men and Muslim men at that only made it worse.Self-censorship about the mass sexual assaults was witnessed in the Australia as well as in Germany. Voices were soon heard that sexual assault was found everywhere - which is true only up to a point, and not on the scale and concentration seen in Cologne.The Cologne outrage points to a systemic problem with the cultural values held by these men. The same people who so loudly condemned Chris Gayle do not want to hear this though. They are hypocrites who would rapidly change their tune if they or one of their female relatives were subjected to this type of assault.

21 Jan 2016 3:08:34pmThis entire article and much of the commentary afterwards is based on a single premise: immigrants into a country will always be a problem for whatever spurious reason suits the writer.In Cologne, a group of criminally inclined youth, apparently mostly from North Africa (which in case you missed your geography lessons is not anywhere near Syria), committed a number of sexual assaults.  That's the fact, but from this we can now deduce that immigration, particularly of Muslims, will lead to general chaos in any society once the level.But let us look at some interesting statistics.  America locks up or subjects to supervisions orders approximately 6% of its population.  They imprison 700 per 100,000 of their population whereas here in Australia we lock up around 200 per 100,000.So let us think about this for a second.  Germany has let in 1.1 million Syrians (and an unknown number from various other countries) recently.  If we use the American averages, this means that possibly 8,000 odd (using round numbers) will have a criminal bent and deserve to be locked up.  Using Australia's number, only 2,000 of them will be.Yes, it is undeniably true and intuitively obvious that if you let in a large number of people numbering millions, a proportion of these people will be undesirable.  It is even possible that certain traumas they have experienced may make them more susceptible to certain mental issues and anti-social behaviors.  It is absolutely absurd to extrapolate from this that allowing them into a society will automatically mean the end of a civilization.And some foot notes - the Germany romantically alluded to in the article has only existed since Bismark.  Prior to that a Prussian would not have considered himself on any level the same as a Bavarian (and vice versa).  Germany has been changing dramatically every 50 years or so for quite some time (the latest being the reunification of East and West) and shows no sign of stopping.Further, the criminals involved in the New Year assaults in Cologne were led (and I think it is certain that they were led), I am quite sure, by individuals who were well aware of what they were doing both from a macro (instilling fear in society generally) and a micro (pandering to their twisted psyches) level.

21 Jan 2016 3:11:41pmIt is all about percentages. When you have such a large influx of strangers into your nick of the wood, there are bound to be a percentage of scums, left-overs, thieves, hand-biters, rapists, and worst of all, religious fanatics.The destruction of order and stability in the Middle East, especially Syria, has caused no ends of troubles for just about everyone, except perhaps Oztraya. Too far to walk, with a huge stretch of waters all around, Europe is the obvious choice for refugees.I do have a lot of respect and admiration for Chancellor Merkel. She is a very brave person to dare to open the front door to just about all comers. I dare say she is also a bit naive. Perhaps she believe the experience of the reunification of the 2 divided German nations can be applied to these refugees. Unfortunately, I believe that is a false hope. For a start, despite the fact that the E.Germans are quite different in outlooks of life in general, they are still very similar in the basics such as racial, religions, ethos. But it is a successful effort in rejoining the jigsaws.As for the refugees, a very different situation altogether. For a start, they come from a society where rigid religious believes divided on sectarian base. Not only that, their social values probably still reflect the rigid traditions of the past. On top of that, there will be hatreds and suspicions between them as a result of what occurred back home. Then holy crap, the fools and idiots who believe wrong that by simply coming to a new country, lives will automatically be better without even trying. The ugly elements among them also see the opportunities to have a go. Of all these difficulties I listed, I believe religions and sectarian believes will be the most difficult hurdles to overcome. The agitators, activists, human rights advocates now see their handy work in full glory. By actively encouraging the breaking up of orders and stability in the middle East, one can be certain of nothing but troubles. Will these activists in the West now happy to take in a few refugees into their own homes ? I doubt it.

21 Jan 2016 3:13:50pmI think Merkel wielded power to try and mitigate this problem of Titanic depressing proportions. Power that has been lacking in all of this sorry mess of Civil Wars and unrest. Which seemingly is lead by a Hitleresque leader Assad (I call him a long streak of Pelican poo, a line from Gallipoli). If not in a complete genocidal maniacal manner, just a quieter tone of indifference to the death and devastation he set in motion. A lack of power from the UN, being hobbled by the usual suspects. One of those suspects, Russia, who has no problem with what Assad has started and aids and begets him. Maybe Putin admires the authoritarian aspect of Assad. Because it can't be for the right of the matter in what Assad is doing.When countries can't seem to do the right thing, I can't see anything wrong with some post modern (not a great way of putting it) power wielding. It seems it is the only hope these slow moving masses of sad humanity have got.

21 Jan 2016 3:16:29pmGermany's acceptance of more than a million refugees (mainly from war torn Syria) is an act of great courage and an example for the rest of humanity!.... I was previously p....d off with the German government for their selfish and irresponsible approach to the Greek debt, but their response to this refugees crisis is an act of redemption beyond comparison.Having said that, it is obvious that Germany cannot accommodate the entire population of Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, etc... Hence it is perfectly reasonable that they now stop the intake and ask other countries to move forward and follow their example. The task for the Germans now becomes one of "sieving" and "integration": "sieving" the immigrants in order to get rid of unwanted characters; fully "integrating" the rest in a productive and humane way into the German society (Germany is already used to this, they have millions of immigrants, including more than a million Muslim immigrants from Turkey).

21 Jan 2016 6:01:11pmHi New World,Angela Merkel responded (quickly and humanely) to a humanitarian emergency. The mess in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan is real, but most Western countries pretend not to see or hear anything, just treating all refugees as "queue jumpers" or even "terrorists in disguise". If the majority of German People are against the policies of Ms Merkel, they will vote her out at the next election, as you correctly write. Let's see.Neither the ALP, Greens or any other political party in this country, now or at any time in the past, have advocated anything even remotely similar to "open borders". "Open borders" is a Conservative fantasy used to scare the children and the simpletons away from Progressive parties.

22 Jan 2016 12:36:01pmALA Voter,Since the disappearance of the internal borders within the EU, many people have moved from East to West, North and South, and the other way around, looking for opportunities they couldn't find in their European country. Each European country has become far more diverse (especially in their big cities) than they have ever been.... and yet Europe is not collapsing, just like multicultural Australia. Their troubles are associated with: a) Globalisation; b) Failed Neoliberal policies applied to each country (in some countries tax evasion is endemic and scandalous!). But they are slowly transitioning away from this, see the case of Italy, for instance, the fact that Greece still stays within the Euro, the failure of nationalistic movements to destroy the Union, etc.

The Immigrants in Germany took advantage of an open door.Many Immigrants were already in a safe haven which the world could have contributed to fund these safe havens till the displaced people could go home.The root problem of people leaving their homes has not been addressed, and there lies the problem to solve. But as I say 1.1 million people did have a safe haven, they chose to take advantage of an open border policy by the Germans.

21 Jan 2016 3:21:15pmIt's really, really simple. The German population [and Europe as a whole] thought they were getting Syrian/Iraqi families - you know husbands, wives, children etc. People who would have a real desire to bed down in their new country. That's that the media presented - lots and lots of images of suffering children stuck on Europe's borders or god-forbid drowning in the Med. As it's turned out they were lied to by the politicians and the media. It's not families - it's wall-to-wall young men; the vast majority Muslim; from a vast spread of different countries. They are not fleeing war [they are certainly not in a rush to defend their homelands are they ?] - it's the lure of Europe's gold. The gates opened and they took full advantage of it.The politicians just do not see that the population has turned against the whole concept - sticking their fingers in their ear and singing "La, La La" won't make it go away.

21 Jan 2016 3:24:07pmEurope is slowly dying, and unless the EU seriously starts to address declining fertility rates across member nations, within just one or two generations, European society as we know it will cease to exist. Take Germany's fertility rate, which has been under 1.4 for at least the last decade. This is just not sustainable in the long term, and one of the main reasons Merkel has welcomed one million migrants. At that rate, Germany's population of 81m (2014), will drop to around 70m by 2060, just from deaths outnumbering births. The percentage of those aged 65 and over will rise from 32% to 59% during the same period, placing far greater pressure on government infrastructure, with an ever decreasing young population to provide the support needed. Germany can address this in two ways - encourage women to have more children, or rely on immigration. The first option is not palatable to many women in modern society, and the latter causes the decline of your society over time anway. In 40 years time we will look back at the first decades of this millennium as the time when Europes slow death march began.

21 Jan 2016 3:25:44pmI wish that all of your correspondents would have a look at Merkel's full initial speech regarding "refugees".She said that Germany would accept them from Iraq, Syria and Eriteria. They would not accept Iranians, Afghanis or from other counties.They were to learn German, get a job and contribute to German society.I was in Europe (including Germany) during Sept/Oct when they were arriving in thousands. The BBC had a large number of reporters interviewing them as they crossed borders as to where they came from. Answers India, Pakistan, Bangladesh,  Egypt, several other north African counties and even a group from Columbia. The Iranians mostly just barged past the mostly female reporters, but some did admit where they were from.Merkel also said that "refugees" from countries not on her list would be returned to their country of origin.. that seems to have conveniently been dropped.I'm in the camp that says someone from Iran, India etc are nothing more than economic "refugees" chasing welfare.

21 Jan 2016 4:12:07pmMerkel has probably, in the medium to long-term, done about as much damage to Germany as Hitler.  And her only salvation will be accepting the obvious.  The very obvious oil and water lesson which is going to be ramping up violently.  The Muslims will never integrate into German culture - but demand and forcefully insist Germany conforms to them and their 'Islamic principles'.  She knows this of course, she let her dogma overcome her common sense in a fit of insanity.  If she thinks Germans will ever forgive the hell she is inflicting on Germany by importing this mob of destruction, she would be totally delusional.  Real germans will be lining up to urinate on her grave.I suspect she'll never really have the courage to deport en masse the fake refugees, the violent, the extremists, even the terrorists.  But hopefully her replacement will.  The right wing has the next election easily.  And across the Europe the song is pretty much the same.  Being born in Germany myself, I can hardly wait to see the end of Merkel (don't care how it happens) and seeing real Germans, instead of elitist fairies in neverland, taking charge and cleaning up the mess she so stupidly and treasonously made.

Immigrants are always a good excuse for the Fascists, but immigrants have been used as excuse for decades now in Europe and I don't see any Fascist revolution arising anywhere.Don't forget, now that Europeans can move and work freely across major parts of the continent, everybody is used to see people of different skin colour, look and accent. The issue with genuine asylum seekers coming from war-torn areas is that of screening (for undesirable characters) and then integration.

21 Jan 2016 4:18:30pmGood article.The influx of too many people whose cultures have being built on misery, violence, inequality, a harbouring of hatred, even greed, is a difficult task for any good willed nation to absorb. I am concerned about the effect of too much migration to this nation where cultural negatives will infiltrate and impact on what we have come to love. While I recognise the wonderful aspects to migration, there are elements of other's cultural practices that I would hate to see become a 'norm' here. I see greed rapidly clawing its way into our psyche and cultural landscape. Kids from parents whose sickened motivations would rather see their kids without a balanced social life, then miss the opportunity of becoming a lawyer or doctor by not attending Kumon every afternoon.I know two migrants (who I like very much) that have sent their kids back to their homelands to be taken care of by their family members. One was sent for difficult behaviour (he was 1 yr old!), the other child's parents sight the problem of affordability. Despite buying designer handbags on weekends! Practices like these I consider bizarre and tell me a lot about their priorities. It also tells me something about the value they place on their children...even babies. Im concerned that the things we like about Australia will no longer exist in the future.

21 Jan 2016 4:39:32pmDel Santa generally gets it right, although this notion that Merkel's open borders policy was driven by an economic rationale is nonsense. Packaging asylums seekers as a potential benefit to the German economy was very much an after thought (the silliness spruiked by the Economist being the exception). Seems the truth is quite simple: Merkel had a brain explosion, set aside her normal cautious/pragmatic self, and went about trying to save the world.But all this is an aside. The inconvenient truth is that the modern asylum seeker makes very little economic contribution. In fact, it's usually the opposite. If we look at Europe alone, asylum seekers (and other migrants) from the ME/north Africa are far likelier to become (intergenerationally) welfare dependant than any other group. Put this down to language difficulties or issues recognising foreign qualifications, etc if you must, but the result is the same.

That is what Merkel meant by 'opportunity' - a mutually beneficial exchange, not exploitation.There are only 2 ways of doing politics - by concentrating on what divides us; or on what unites us as human beings.Clearly Merkel and the author of this article are on different sides when it comes to which way is best.

21 Jan 2016 5:05:22pmHi Matthew,Your 4th last paragraph is disappointing in its false assumptions and strange deductions.  "Without lines on the map there are no nations..".  Yes, by definition.  Although hardly democratic in the sense we in Australia are used to, the level of democratisation in the UN is an incredible achievement for a world given its history of international relations.  The UN continues to work towards global democracy, in the imperfect way I'm sure all we humans have come to expect.Finally, it is clearly better for "humanity", under whichever defition it is you intend, for Syrians to move to Germany: either it is better from a humanitarian point of view because ISIS and civil war will provide "worse" treatment of the said refugees, or, from the perspective of all humanity, there are clearly better ecominc opportunities for those leaving civil war/ISIS in Germany.  Movement of people across borders has rarely been zero-sum, and it is strange that a researcher familiar with economic history would claim so.Otherwise many interesting points, but for our sake please eliminate your redundant pessimism.

21 Jan 2016 5:11:47pmAll these asylum seekers in Germany are not permanently resettled.  For many this will mean no real interest in being integrated into German society. Most will live out a marginalised existance because of the lack of employment opportunities.  Eventually they can be easily repatriated.  A wave of this size reaching Australia would pose significant risks because all deemed to be refugees will be permanently resettled and hence entitled to social services.  Even those not deemed to be refugees will be difficult to deport.  Such a wave will cause the collapse of social services.

21 Jan 2016 5:29:42pmMerkel's decision to disregard the Dublin Protocol was a knee jerk response to the image of a drowned toddler on a beach in Turkey. That image was initially accompanied by advice his family were fleeing persecution in Syria. The image did not tell the whole story. The family had been living in safety in Turkey for 3 years. The father risked the lives of his family for "a better life" in an affluent western democracy. Merkel put "the sugar on the table" and millions were attracted. Strictly speaking many were not refugees, escaping persecution but a disproportionate number of young men seeking a better life.Most western democracies have principled immigration policies prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of religion. Selection of refugees should be entrusted to governments rather than people smugglers. It is reasonable to give preference to persecuted religious minorities and families that include women and children.

21 Jan 2016 10:17:02pmIn the 70s, 80s and even 90s the Germans would normally accept "refugees" from the eastern block and slowly integrate them into the society. That being said the "refugees" were overwhelmingly "volkdeutsche", German ethnics living in Eastern Europe. They spoke the language (although a more archaic version) were eager to integrate and in vast majority of cases had desirable skills. Back then there was a very clear expectation that you will:1. Relinquish your original citizenship and take on just German citizenship2. Change your name to the German version for instance John Bird would be known as Johann Vogel.Its a big jump from that very strict integration system to what we see today. Considering that the locals back then were hardly ever welcoming to these migrants I doubt that the attitudes of this notoriously conservative society will change overnight.

21 Jan 2016 6:37:23pmMerkel (and now Germany's) problem is that she naively project secular, humanist values into decisions made about a group of people who have no understanding of the concept. Apart from the cultural disaster of importing masses of young males from misogynistic, corrupt countries into Germany, she'll now have to find at least a few hundred thousands jobs for unskilled men with no language skills. Given youth unemployment is already high, this is impossible. So she's consigned this group of people to welfare dependency, just like what's happened in Australia. Germany is about to experience serious social problems with Merkel's decision, and they'll be mopping it up for decades. I fully expect Germany to have to close its borders to refugees, triggering a chain reaction in neighbouring countries until Europe becomes a fortress. The UN should be building massive, temporary camps in the middle east, as the West sends a firm message that exporting a population from a dysfunctional, sectarian country is no solution to their problems at all: in fact it probably makes it worse.

21 Jan 2016 9:03:52pmInspector P,"Merkel's stupidity will become ever more apparent."I hardly think this kind of ridicule is fair. Merkel was/is trying to solve a human problem with social concern.If you want to deliver vitriol or ridicule, aim it straight at the economic refugees who are forcing themselves on Germany and the rest of the world.We are being too kind by half. The genuine refugees are camped next door to their desperately troubled homeland, and urgently need a safe home.I am currently in the process of forming the view that no refugee should be considered for permanent status if they will not surrender their beliefs which are the basis for the trouble being visited on the rest of the world.Please don't carry on about my attitude to religion, I am an atheist and don't have one, but I'm quite happy for you to have one that doesn't cause a problem to others.

21 Jan 2016 7:40:40pmIt is worth giving some thought to the issue of your own culture. Should you make the decision for your neighbour to change their culture and their long held beliefs?Is it asking too much that an immigrant to your country should be asked to adopt  one of the popular religions, adopt the popular language of our country in public? Is it asking too much that an immigrant to our country should work for wages for their lifetime and pay back some of the money we spent on them, in taxes?After all, we are asking our countrymen to support theses people. We expect courtesy in return. For myself, I would like to know they pay taxes, but most importantly, that they say "Hello."

21 Jan 2016 7:44:24pmHas Germany's compassion moment proved to be naive? The question assumes Germany's motivation was only compassion because the government said so. I have a hunch, they were also motivated to obtain cheap labour.Alternatively, you could ask did the German government act in the best interests of the population it has a duty of care to. Maybe the answer is no. I can't imagine the government was naive to the risks it was taking. They allowed a large number of young single men to enter the country without assessment if they are a risk to the wellbeing of others. The risk they may have a criminal record and the other more complex risk to assess but I believe not impossible. A fundamentalist view of the Koran that may lead to violence, particularly against women.  What would be the influence knowing the Pakistan's democratic elected government allows Muslim clerics to veto proposed enactment of law? Recently a woman member of parliament in government, failed to change the law to increase the age from 9 years old for a girl to legally marry. The proposed amendment failed because the clerics assessed it as not complying with the requirements of the Koran. The Koran was written 1,500 years ago.  Anyone growing up with this culture would be influenced by the literal view placed on the Koran. 1,500 years ago not many, if any culture put much value on women. Like the Bible, the Koran is well meaning with many wise words but maybe it was not written to be read literally. Like poetry, it can be read with the heart of the now. What does love mean in 2016, I believe the Koran's author would be expecting the reader to ask this in their heart. The cultural difference between religious fundamentalism and the modern world is incredibly vast and there will be no compromise from a fundamentalist. And at the heart of the difference is the value and treatment of woman. Maybe the events in Cologne are not an impossible challenge for social justice to be balanced. If a person seeking to live in a country that values the rights, dignity and wellbeing of woman equally with men and that person is assessed to not share the same values, why should they not be refused? It's likely what the German government did was negligent with the safety of the German people because it's logical those events in Cologne could occur.

21 Jan 2016 8:17:38pmI too have wondered why Merkel did it.It is incomprehensible or impossible that Merkel was so naive.She must have known what was going to happen,  but she must have done some special deals and was willing to sacrifice her own people.Overall it shows the complete stupidity of allowing political parties to run a country, and the people of a country are not allowed to run their own country.

21 Jan 2016 8:46:04pmJust a hunch,I too, have pondered the subject from the same angle as you.There are two cultures to be considered, theirs and ours. Their religion isn't a lot like ours, and is it sense to say that the hosts should immediately change for the sake of not causing them offence. Should it be that they not cause us offence?Our current problem is that a minority of them are indulging in actions of hatred against others. Should we tolerate this? Further, they tell us that their religion is the real one and we should change?Now this is reaching the point that we cannot accommodate, that is adopting their religion. The next action is the important one. I think we need to tell them that any change that takes place needs to be their change.

21 Jan 2016 7:55:03pmThis article is confused from start to end, beginning with the word play around two meanings of the word compassion to prove that a compassionate act does not involve taking responsibility for the unfortunate because the feeling of compassion is transient. Later the duty of compassion is mentioned as if the previous argument had not been put at all. And that is about as logical as it gets, which is commonly the case when logic is constructed to support a set of conclusions already firmly held.The arguments about German-ness require an homogenous and ossified view of German culture and society that seems unusual for an academic specialising in historic perspectives on identity.It is irrational to suggest that Germany does not have the capacity to protect its citizens or prevent situations such as occurred in Cologne from being repeated or that insidious principles such as compassion and neoliberalism will destroy the nation state or that 1.1 million refugees will accomplish what two world wars, a Depression, fascism and partition failed to achieve.

21 Jan 2016 8:05:37pmThe article and comments following include some hysteria and exaggeration of facts.  I am a fairly avid reader and listener to world news events and for some reason I have missed much of what is claimed as fact by commentators to this forum.  I can only assume that many comments are simply people putting their preconceived notions into words.  We are fortunate to be able to voice our opinions in this manner.  Many people in the world do not have such an opportunity.We in Australia have no idea what it is like to share common borders with many other countries and populations.  The fact is that with the release of those who were in camps in the Mediterranean countries, each subsequent country entered was faced with a large flood of people determined to travel to Germany and other more prosperous countries.  What was to be done?  Once they arrived in countries bordering Germany, that country was faced with either accepting the incoming people or putting immediate neighbour's offside particularly as the German leader had by that time put out the welcome mat.The obvious answer to this ongoing problem is for European countries in particular to all contribute towards resolving the issues that people are fleeing from. Unfortunately, there has been a tendency for many European countries to turn a blind eye to what has been happening in the Middle East.  Perhaps their hangover from the GFC has caused them to be inward looking.   Unfortunately, no country in such close proximity to the Middle East can ignore what is happening.  When people flee the ME and northern African countries, Europe is at least achievable.  Those who attempt to get to say Australia are faced with a much greater and more dangerous task.The fact that many of those entering Germany and it's close neighbour's includes those who have not considered the cultural differences between their own country and those they are entering OR they are just plain criminals. Either way there is no easy answer to the issues to be faced.  If there was an easy solution it would have been found by now.Until the ME crisis has been resolved the turmoil in Europe in particular will continue.

21 Jan 2016 8:25:10pmMany European politicians laughed at the Tony Abbott,s London speech on the European migration. Who's laughing now?! Tony Abbott was talking from his own experience. I don't think many European politicians have any idea whet they have got themselves in. The biggest problem is that they are still not realizing the enormity of the problem they created. Many of them still believe that they can stop the 'human avalanche' at will. They must be really naive believing that people will so easily give up on moving to an affluent society and that people smuggling criminals will so easily give up billions of dollars from the people smuggling  industry. I expect some extraordinary developments in Europe in the next few years. It is going to be a real chaos which will shake up the foundations of Europe. Mark my words!!!

21 Jan 2016 8:36:03pmThere is one thing i have learned from all this, i ran my eyes over some of the facebook pages deemed to be racist, the reclaim a brain type of sites. These people live in a little world of like minded people, they think their comments about others from other countries are cutting edge and so good people can not challenge them. What they don't get is that one read of the rubbish and most thinking people decide they are not worthy of debate.   I can gather from these sites that only men from North Africa are capable of abusing women as it happened in Germany, mention that our jails contain many home grown predators and that you don't have to be from North Africa to be an abuser of women and you yourself will cop a dose of verbal abuse. I really could see any drunk large group of single men causing problems for women no matter where they are or who they are. It amazes me there people have not called to ban the Catholic Religion with their crimes finally coming out, but these groups again only go for one religion.Australians on these sites love to read stories like what happened in Germany as it is another piece in the jigsaw in their alarmist dialogue, but at the same time while they love to point fingers it works well as the look over there tactic as Australia itself has a very sleazy underbelly. I hear many stories of young foreign girls abused here whist on working visa', alone and isolated, they get led down the garden path and abused, money stolen, you name it. And you would be very surprised who the abusers turn out to be, not new comers, not Muslims, nope, home grown Aussies, and some who even wear uniforms. Remember too, the worst and most serious crimes ever committed in this county and continue to be have been perpetrated by people of European Christian heritage, but don't tell the haters that one. Point is, bad men are bad men, men who drink are men who drink, they are everywhere in every part of the world.

22 Jan 2016 11:27:21amNo.  The point is, that refugees are raping the female citizens of the generous nation that welcomed, feed, house and fund them.  The same females who were encouraged to welcome this horde at train stations with bottled water, blankets and teddie bears.  The point is, where has Germany's naivety gotten it?The point is, does Europe continue welcoming young unidentified foreign men from societies that foster the most misogynist and homophobic views on Earth. The West its home grown rapists, but the point is, should we import more rapists?And yes, Europeans have committed atrocities in this country, but millions of non-Europeans flock to this this country to stake their piece of it.  To guiltlessly grab the proceeds of those crimes.So lets get back to the 'point' please.

I therefore follows that no matter what these immigrants do, it is good, okay. Because bad things have been done by other among us in the past.How about we put it this way. There are crimes which we abhor, and if you immigrants commit one of those we will get upset, charge you and if you are guilty, we will decide on which punishment our locals would receive today, an deliver it upon you.

21 Jan 2016 9:32:36pmSaudi Arabia which recently beheaded 47 people is using British made planes flown by British trained pilots to drop bombs on Yemen under the supervision of British military officers. It is reducing Yemen to rubble, killing thousands and creating another million or more refugees for the rednecks to blame the victims for causing a refugee problem.What price stupidity?

21 Jan 2016 10:50:51pmA naive response.It ignores Australia's experience that proves - beyond doubt - that the people smuggling business is about PULL factors not the oft quoted PUSH factors favoured by the EuroCommunists that dominate the EU, UN agencies and many of the involved national governments of Europe.Basing border policy on PUSH factor analysis led to at least 1 thousand 2 hundred dead off Australia's shores.Merkels Europe has not moved from their Rudd like position and have killed 20 thousand in the Mediterranean.The Eurocommunist dominated ABC have made an art form of failing to challenge the incompetent - murderously negligent - EU-UN operatives whose policies kill at least 3 thousand a year.Naive also is the author's failure to analyse the impact of multinational corporation participants. The Goldman Sachs World Economic Forum types - the leaders of which - are on the record as stating their desire to end the nation state.These multinational corp's write most of the trade deals.They see the mass importation of foreigners to Europe as a way of breaking down national barriers.The author fails to mention the influence - the policy - of Iran and Saudia Arabia as they fund the invasion of Western Europe.Iran has funded the 'Islamic Left' in national parliaments of Europe and in the EU excuse of a parliament.To the tune of Billions of dollars!Not reported on your ABC of course.Both regimes refuse to use extensive infrastructure to host fellow Muslims and fail to fund nearby refugee camps.What they are interested in is increasing their power over the hated democracies of Europe through changing the demographics of Europe.The French President was elected on the Muslim vote.In short, a pathetic article...

22 Jan 2016 11:18:03amMerkel policy in giving the corrupt and incompetent Greek government over 400 Billion Euros in EU taxpayers money was hardly "austerity" .It was the  believe that if Greece was to leave the Euro somehow the EU would collapse. In relating to the refugees , Merkels humanitarianism is no doubt a response based on the guilt of past (WW2). In realtion to Merkel saying "multi culturalism" does not work ,  it simply means that young muslim men cannot treat women the way do in their home country . Is that a problem?

22 Jan 2016 2:49:08pmAgain, using an economic rationale to justify an open borders policy is nonsense.Asylum seeker outcome statistics and proxy data clearly show the vast majority of asylum seekers who settle in the West become dependants, not contributors to economic activity. While Merkel et al initially claimed many asylum seekers were qualified engineers and medical doctors, this was grossly overstated and failed consider difficulties recognising qualifications from countries such as Syria.
