As Pauline Hanson enters Parliament, relatives of Chinese gold rush miners are conducting a long walk to honour their ancestors' determination in the face of discrimination, and remember a long history of xenophobia.Max Brady may be a true blue Aussie bloke from Toowoomba, but he is "happy as Larry" with his Chinese heritage that for many years was an avoided topic among his family."It wasn't a hidden secret but it was not encouraged within Australia to talk about these sorts of things, being Anglo-orientated and possibly a little xenophobic," he said.Mr Brady's great grandfather Wong Ah Sat came to Australia during the gold rush. In 1857 — the year he arrived — the Victorian Government introduced a 10 pound tax for every Chinese person that entered a Victorian port.The large fee was designed to stem the flow of Chinese migrants.It meant almost 20,000 determined men like Sat entered the country via Robe in South Australia, and began a more than 400-kilometre journey on foot to places like Ballarat and Bendigo."It's just the way it is and still is, as recent events keep reminding us, there's elements of fear," Mr Brady said."It wouldn't have been a picnic." Like many of the Chinese miners, Sat went on to become an integral part of Australian society.He married Amelia Hackney, a woman from a well-to-do English family, and owned stores in the Bathurst and Bolong areas in country NSW. Mr Brady has driven down to Victoria this week to take part in an 83km walk from Parliament House in Melbourne to Ballarat, in honour of his great grandfather. The walk is part of the Chinese Fortunes exhibition, a series of events run by the Museum of Australian Democracy (MADE) to celebrate the contribution Chinese people have made to Australia over the past 165 years. MADE ambassador Jane Smith said it was still a relatively hidden history."They knew how to use water, they grew food, one of the eminent historians said to me possibly without the Chinese, the Europeans would not have actually survived," she said."There are amazing things that the Chinese did, and in the face of a degree of adversity with the sort of discrimination they suffered."Mr Brady said with more recent events such as Pauline Hanson's maiden speech in the Australian Senate, the walk is a timely reminder of discrimination in Australia. "I think the 10 pound tax issue probably needs to be aired again if only to tell us that things don't change," he said.
