Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull says Government claims that he is trying to stir up anti-China sentiment are "contemptible".The Government's relationship with China has come under the spotlight after Defence Minister Joel Fitzgibbon was forced to admit he had not declared two free trips he took to China which were paid for by Chinese-Australian businesswoman Helen Liu.The trips came under scrutiny after allegations surfaced that the Defence Department had conducted a secret investigation into their relationship over concerns she may be a security risk.The Opposition has questioned the Government's dealings with China, with Mr Turnbulll accusing the Prime Minister - who is currently pushing for China to be given a more prominent role in the IMF - of being too much of an advocate for Beijing.Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner has accused Mr Turnbull of stirring up "yellow peril" sentiments but Mr Turnbull says the remarks are "contemptible.""I have done a lot of business in China and one of the things that I have learnt over the years is that the Chinese respect people who stand up for their own interests, countries that stand up for their own interests, just as China always stands up for its interests," he told AM."When important matters of national interest are raised instead of dealing with them on their merits he tries to raise spectres of racism and casting back to bygone eras and Mr Tanner's remarks suggest we should just fall into line with whatever China wants."That is not in Australia's interests and it is not an approach that China would respect."In response to Mr Fitzgibbon's failure to disclose the trips he took in 2002 and 2005, Independent Senator Nick Xenophon has announced he will push for politicians to reveal all free trips they have taken within 60 days.Senator Xenophon says MPs should have to declare the travel and provide a comprehensive report within two months."So if an MP doesn't disclose, doesn't provide a report, they should be required to pay back the airfares and accommodation as a matter of course," he said.
