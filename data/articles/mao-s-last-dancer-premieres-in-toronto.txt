A film adaptation of the autobiography Mao's Last Dancer, by a Chinese-Australian stock broker who gained fame as one of China's best dancers, has premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival.The best-selling book, released in 2003, follows Li Cunxin's transition from a peasant boy in rural China to one of the world's most acclaimed ballet dancers.Australian director Bruce Beresford took on the difficult task of bringing the book to movie screens."The challenge was to fit all these years into a movie and to find the story within the story," Mr Beresford said.When he was 11 years old, Mr Cunxin was chosen by Madame Mao's cultural advisers to train at the Beijing Dance Academy.He trained rigorously to become the best dancer his generation and by age 18 ended up at the Houston Ballet in Texas on a cultural exchange.That is where, at age 20, Li Cunxin defected to the United States, causing an international conflict that grabbed headlines worldwide.The film uses three different actors to play Mr Cunxin at three different points in his life and focuses on relationships with his family and the people who helped him in his journey.Cunxin, now 48, travels regularly to China these days and is a stockbroker in Australia, where he lives with his wife and three children.Despite all his acclaim as a dancer and his life at the centre of an international crisis, he said it was easy to pick the highlight, which is an award he was given this past August."My biggest accomplishment is not all the accolades I got in my dancing career; not all the money I've made as a stock broker; not the accolades from my book," he said."It's actually being recognised with the Australian Father of the Year Award."
