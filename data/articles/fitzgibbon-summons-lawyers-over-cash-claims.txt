Former defence minister Joel Fitzgibbon has strenuously denied "outrageous" and "defamatory" allegations that he received a large undisclosed cash payment from Chinese-Australian businesswoman Helen Liu.Fairfax newspapers have today reported that documents show Mr Fitzgibbon was given around $150,000 for "expenses and gifts" by Ms Liu as a way of cultivating him as a political contact.Making a brief statement to Parliament today Mr Fitzgibbon said he rejected the claims "completely" and indicated he may take legal action."I believe them to be defamatory," he said. "The matter is now in the hands of my lawyers for immediate action."Fairfax says Ms Liu's records show she began a joint commercial venture with the Fitzgibbon family, with $3 million set aside for start-up costs.The reports also say that Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard was told by a former associate of Ms Liu's that Mr Fitzgibbon may have had more dealings with Ms Liu than he had previously disclosed.Mr Fitzgibbon was forced to resign from the frontbench last year after it was revealed his brother used his office to lobby for Defence health contracts.But by the time he resigned he already had a tenuous grip on his position after admitting he had not declared flights to China he had received from Ms Liu.His and his family's friendship with Ms Liu came to light after it was claimed Defence was spying on Mr Fitzgibbon because of his relationship with her.An internal Defence investigation subsequently found there was no basis to the allegations.
