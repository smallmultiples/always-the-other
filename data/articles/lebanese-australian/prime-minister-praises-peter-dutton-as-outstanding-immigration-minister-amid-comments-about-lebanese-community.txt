Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has praised Peter Dutton as an "outstanding" Immigration Minister amid community anger and calls for his sacking over comments about Australian-Lebanese Muslims. Yesterday in Parliament, Mr Dutton suggested allowing the ethnic group into Australia in the 1970s was a mistake.He said most people recently charged with terror-related offences came from a Lebanese-Muslim background.Asked whether he supported the comments, Mr Turnbull said: "There is no question that there are lessons to be learned from previous immigration policies and the minister was reflecting on ... policies many years ago. He's entitled to do that."Under persistent questioning, Mr Turnbull declined to repeat or condemn the remark, but repeatedly praised Mr Dutton's performance."Peter Dutton is a thoughtful and committed and compassionate Immigration Minister," he said."Peter Dutton is doing an outstanding job as Immigration Minister."Mr Dutton told Parliament 22 of the last 33 people charged with terrorism-related offences were the children and grandchildren of Lebanese Muslim migrants.He said last week that former prime minister Malcolm Fraser "did make mistakes in bringing some people in".Lebanese-Australian Muslims say they are hurt and angered by the comments.As of 2006, the number of Australians of Lebanese background totalled 181,738, including 16,201 people whose parents were born in Australia.Jihad Dib, a Lebanese Muslim Australian and the Labor Member for Lakemba in NSW, said it was wrong for the Liberal Party to "generalise"."It's ill thought of and the purpose, I think, is solely to try to appeal to a nationalistic sense — that's to provide a sense of exclusion rather than one of inclusion," he said.Mr Dib said Mr Dutton's words were counterproductive to "all of the good work that's been going on — particularly in terms of inclusion, in terms of harmony, and in terms of shaping Australia for what it truly is". In Lakemba, 15 kilometres south-west of Sydney's CBD, many Lebanese-Muslims have settled in after moving to Australia, mostly in the 1970s and 1980s.There are also large numbers of Lebanese-Muslims who were born in Australia, including 42-year-old Jasmin, who found Mr Dutton's remarks in Parliament "really upsetting".Jasmin said she and her family felt lucky to call themselves Australians, and they just happened to come from a Lebanese-Muslim background."I mean, I treat everybody fairly, respect every other person's religion ... we're all the same, really, in the end," she said."He's really ignorant, because he's probably basing that on the extremists that you hear on the news who identify themselves as Muslims, who I believe are not Muslims."Labor's Tony Burke, whose Watson electorate is in south-west Sydney, suggested Mr Dutton's comments would undermine cooperation with law enforcement authorities."The people who would be angriest about this, I expect, will be our security agencies," he said."Peter Dutton has just attacked a group that has been cooperating so closely with our security agencies and I think they would be devastated and shocked that a minister would do that."This is a bizarre, weird argument of racial profiling." Queensland LNP MP George Christensen launched a defence of the his colleague's comments."The dysfunction that [Malcolm] Fraser's open-slather immigration policy caused is still being felt today," he said."Many of the second and third generation of these migrants have been locked in a mono-cultural enclave that breeds extremism," he said, referring to south-west Sydney.Greens immigration spokesman Nick McKim labelled Mr Dutton a racist and called for his sacking."We've had comment after comment, spanning a long period of time, where he's attacked immigrants on the basis of being illiterate and innumerate," he said."Now, to link second and third generations to terrorists is just a step too far and he's just got to go."
