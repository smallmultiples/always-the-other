It was 10 years ago today that the Cronulla riots exploded and made headlines in Australia and across the world.It began with text messages circulating across Sydney, urging people to protest against the bashing of two volunteer lifesavers.It was an ugly call to arms: "Get down to North Cronulla to help support Leb and wog bashing day."We're a strong community and I think we've moved on, but there's no doubt that what happened that day is shameful. By early morning more than 5,000 had converged on the North Cronulla beach car park.The swelling crowd began chanting: "We grew here, you flew here."The violence that eventually took hold of the suburb demonstrated racial tensions many Australians were not prepared to admit existed and ran deep in the area.Ron is a Cronulla local who went to the beach that day after finishing work.He said the initial protest was overtaken by drunks and rednecks."I wouldn't say it was a good thing the way it happened, but the original idea was extremely necessary because you'd call for [police] assistance and nothing would come," he said. Ron does not believe the area should continue to be defined by the riots."It hasn't happened since, so whatever happened that day saved a lot of people a lot of grief around this place," he said.Nicky Surnicky is another Cronulla local.She agreed the event was a stain on the community.Ms Surnicky said while travelling overseas, many people knew about her hometown because of the riots."We're a strong community and I think we've moved on, but there's no doubt that what happened that day is shameful," she said.Dwayne Bruce has lived in the area for 37 years.He said he understood that some people might still not want to visit or move to the area."It's as if they're afraid to come to Cronulla; I think there's an undertone," he said."It's sad because it destroyed the culture, the laidback feeling of Cronulla."But not everyone has allowed the riots to colour their opinion of the area.Fatima Mourad is a Lebanese Australian who lives in Wiley Park. She teaches English to refugees and recently took her students to Cronulla on an unrelated field trip.It was the first time she had ever visited the area but she was well aware of its history.She said she chose not to tell her students about what happened 10 years ago as it was not useful."We don't want to create fear, we just want them to come and enjoy their time and embrace Australian culture," she said."It's a historical event, it shouldn't affect us anymore, we shouldn't think about it anymore."
