Stripping Australian citizenship from home-grown terrorists who are dual nationals would free our authorities from certain legal shackles and allow them to act against the radicals, writes Rodger Shanahan.The Prime Minister's national security statement included a reference to the possible stripping of citizenship from dual citizens.There has been criticism that such a move will be ineffectual. Peter Hughes said it was of limited use because, even though the individuals would be prevented from returning to Australia, they "would be free to pursue extremist causes and political violence elsewhere". And in the Sydney Morning Herald, Professor Matthew Gibney from Oxford University argued against the move from a civil libertarian perspective, saying that "denationalisation is thus open to the same criticism that Voltaire made of the practice in 18th century France: namely, that it simply constitutes throwing into our neighbour's yard those stones that incommode us in our own".This largely echoed a piece from last year by Sydney University's Professor Ben Saul.While I acknowledge these points, they would carry more weight if the proposal to strip citizenship rendered the person stateless. The subject's failure to renounce another citizenship they possess indicates that they must continue to hold some attachment to that country, and as a continuing citizen of it, they would continue to have an identity and the safeguards afforded by that country.The civil libertarian argument, however, fails to address what I would argue is a more serious issue: the potential eradication of targeting constraints for Australian intelligence agencies and military forces in dealing with Australian citizens engaged in terrorist activities overseas.The possession of Australian citizenship rightly imposes limitations on how much information Australia's spy agencies can collect, and perhaps more importantly who they can share it with. There have already been legislative amendments to strengthen the intelligence-collection powers of these agencies, but dealing with non-citizens gives them much greater flexibility in sharing information.So, rather than dual citizens simply becoming someone else's problem or able to undertake violent actions elsewhere, such a move may actually free up Australian authorities to address the problem by sharing information on foreign fighters or terrorists who were formerly Australian citizens.This may simply mean that the former dual citizen can be arrested and jailed, or deported to their remaining country of nationality. But it may also mean they are killed in a counter-terrorist military operation.In fact, there has been criticism in the UK that people stripped of their citizenship have been killed in drone strikes shortly after, and that the information that enabled their targeting was only released to the US after they were no longer UK citizens. I think this is the more appropriate discussion to be having, rather than a civil libertarian one.To take one possible example, would the Australian public be happy to see a former dual Lebanese-Australian citizen born and raised in Sydney, but now simply a Lebanese citizen because they are fighting for Islamic State, killed in a RAAF bombing mission in Iraq based on intelligence gathered by Australian agencies? I think the public would accept this.None of the steps proposed by the Government represents a silver bullet, but incremental changes to our ability to respond represent an appropriate answer to a unique challenge. Radical jihadists are not Islamic nationalists; they recognise no authority but their interpretation of what God commands them to do.They are by definition and by action intolerant and they are as far removed from the humanist traditions of the Western societies from which some of them emerged as it is possible to be. And while Australian dual citizens fail to recognise the authority of the Commonwealth and kill in God's name, they are protected by the fact that they are citizens of a Commonwealth whose authority they have plainly rejected.For those relatively few to whom this situation applies, we should look at the stripping of dual nationality as a military and intelligence targeting issue rather than simply a civil libertarian issue.This article was originally published by Lowy Institute's The Interpreter.

Fighting for IS is a mindset issue and changing mindsets is difficult and partly even disallowed because it's very close to the thought police.I have no problems with these misguided fighters not being able to return to Australia. And what happen to this population group overseas does not phase me; do I have to say sorry for that? Yes, we are throwing the stone across the fence but did the stone not come from there in the first place?

26 Feb 2015 12:40:56pm'Yes, we are throwing the stone across the fence but did the stone not come from there in the first place?' - the author posed a hypothetical of an Australian born citizen with dual citizenship. What then? And what if their second country doesn't want them either?What do you do with that stone?
Alert moderator
26 Feb 2015 1:55:28pmThe stone made its informed decision and therefore should suffer the consequences - after all there should be some form of condemnation for people who support beheading people and raping women just because they aren't Muslims. If we extend tolerance to these people just because they are "Australian citizens" we are signing the death warrant of our society. Mind you I apply the same standards to dealing with any religious fundamentalist - in the case of Christians export them to the US Bible Belt to hang out with the nut jobs there.

27 Feb 2015 8:27:54amMalcolm, you seem to have missed my point.I'm not discussing tolerance that should be extended toward these people, in that case I pretty much agree with you. What I'm asking is that in the case of an Australian born dual national what happens if our government decides to revoke their Australian citizenship and their second country imposes a restriction on their entry into that country? I don't know the laws concerning the issue so I'm asking if someone does.Has this been considered by the government before they started making anouncing the proposals?
Alert moderator
27 Feb 2015 9:24:57amAs it typically happens, in the event of someone being stripped their dual Australian citizenship, their ability to travel is restricted to whatever their OTHER passport allows in the country they were situated at the time. Often this means they cannot leave that country altogether; which works fine for me if the country happens to be Syria.That said, I believe we should step up this approach by legally acknowledging IS as a 'state'- and use it as justification to strip everyone else there of Australian citizenship as well. This would solve a lot of problems- we wouldn't even need to prevent them leaving Australia anymore.

27 Feb 2015 9:20:00amMalcolm.The issue should not be one of citizenship, dual or otherwise.It should be one of Crimes Against Humanity.Beheading, kidnapping and raping in the name of any fighting force be it religious or politic, constitutes crimes against humanity and should be dealt with as such.  If you have been fighting in a foreign army that has committed any such acts, you should not be allowed back irrespective of your citizenship and whether or not the country in which you are fighting deports you.

Even if their parent(s) who became citizens to both countries, the child can only be dual citizen if the country from which the parents came provides them citizenship automatically or through application.  If the latter is the case, then the child shall be dealt with as any dual citizen regardless of place of birth; i.e. they (the legal guardian) made the choice so they wear the consequence.  People MUST be held accountable for the choices THEY make.

Since we've joined in, terrorist groups have told their followers to not bother leaving their countries and attack them instead.I'd say we wasted a once-in-a-century opportunity thanks to Abbott's backflip.

26 Feb 2015 2:24:15pmI believe the only reason for stripping somebody of their citizenship if they migrated here is if they gained it by false pretences you know fraud .  If you strip them of citizenship for any other reasons you are saying that their citizenship is  a second class because they are born overseas . I would like to know the constitutionally of stripping citizenship of people who have it by birthright .  i know of two countries that stripped the citizenship of people born in that country that being Germany during the rule of the Nazis and Uganda under  Idi Amin .By having rules you can strip the citizenship for any other reason than obtaining it by fraud you are saying citizenship is essentially worthless .  If a person wants to renounce their citizenship then yes we can accept that.

26 Feb 2015 3:18:31pm"what if you were fighting for ISIL before Australia signed up to provide logistical support, training, fighter bombers etc to defend Iraq"ISIL was initially created for the purpose of fighting the Iraqi military. So the scenario you mention is impossible. By definition, anyone who joint ISIL when it was created was declaring war with Iraq and us.It was only recently that ISIL attacked Syria as well. We never considered ISIL or Syria to be an ally and to my knowledge, that hasn't changed.

Appropriate treatment including rehabilitation, religious deprogramming and ongoing support to assist with rejoining society as a health and normal (and not disaffected) member of the community is the solution to this problem.ps. and the benefit of this mental health approach is that we do not need to destroy the cornerstones of western culture (liberty, freedom and privacy).

27 Feb 2015 1:33:48pmIMBY, you are very mistaken. These persons who elect to follow such as ISIS  are NOT MENTALLY ILL. You'd find that they are flawed by that they either HAVE A  PERSONALITY DISORDER that's either full blown or at the least extra strong in the traits of such or a combination of overlaping personality disorders. It's via their inflated sense of entitlement, sociopathic tendencies that lead to their sense of being disaffiliated.  It occurs because their local Australian society doesn't meet their desires and expectations where they provide no sound basis for any recognition or wants to be fullfilled the way they'd like them to be.The consensus is amongst health professionals is that in the main personality disorders cannot be treated. That persons with them are resistant to being changed, nor do they generally accept they have a problem. Your recommended course of action has no hope of being effective. If you explore the persons backgrounds who've left to join ISIS from Australia you'd be shocked at the number of youth who had well off , great educational backgrounds, social options, others who were even employed , sure a few unemployed or crim types and in the main from families that have been aghast by their choices, very moderate types of folk. They have the type of angry disaffiliation that is similar to later non bullied school shooters, the cinema shooter, the nasty Norweign Island shooter etc..It's why ISIS and it's cruelty with beheadings appeal to them.

27 Feb 2015 3:14:11pmHi Brigitte Jones,Was that one for me (and not IMBY) by chance?Yes, personality disorders are notoriously difficult to treat though it can be treated as noted by a paper in the Journal of Personality Disorders, conducted by Gregory K. Brown, PhD, and his colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania, which noted that the patients symptoms came down significantly after a year of therapy.Kathleen Taylor of Oxford University Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics is a Neuroscientist and she has suggested that religious fundamentalism may also be treated as a curable mental illness in the future.However one would expect un-rehabilitated/treated people to remain in secure treatment facilities until such time as they no longer pose a threat to society.

27 Feb 2015 5:02:22pmJoeBloggs :"Personality disorders can be treated."I agree, yes they can. However you neglect to note that No mental health disorder, be it psychiatric or psychological be effectively treated without the willingness of the individual to WANT to be treated/cured.Do you or the learned ones you quote have any suggestions re how to cajole, encourage or force these "mentally" disordered scum to undertake effective therapy. To stop them slaughtering innocents, raping children,selling pre-pubescent girls at the local market, stealing from citizens in their invaded territory, forced labor from those able to assist them or destroying ancient artifacts.Personally, I think you ask too much of our Mental Health Services, or you have your head in the clouds.We are currently doing a less than acceptable job at present dealing with mental health issues in this nation. And that is treating those who want to be effectively treated or cured of their mental health issues.I certainly don`t think Christine of the watermellons suggestion that we talk to em is an effective cure.As for the recalcitrant ones who refuse "treatment"Dual internationals.

26 Feb 2015 12:31:26pmI see no problem with stripping Australian citizenship from Australians with dual citizenship if they travel overseas to fight for or aid any military or terrorist body whose aims are opposed to Australia's.

Fighting for whichever side is now equally illegal but if the basis 'lets not allow these people to return to Australia' is that ISIL is so bad (and it is), then where is the logic of preventing anti-ISIL fighters to return? Mind you, anyone involved in armed conflict is likely to be experiencing PTSD et cetera and is vulnerable and could pose problems for Australia; but that equally applied to the Aussies who signed up as private security contractors for US companies in Iraq, the adventurers who join French Foreign Legion, etc. . .

26 Feb 2015 9:18:10pmI think the whole point is that the government of the day can elect which individual dual nationals it can revoke citizenship from. Through policy, they could elect to leave dual nationals who fight for the 'goodies' (the government's definition), while removing it from those who fight for ISIL. The policy would be designed to be applied inconsistently (from a legal perspective), but that's the whole point. It leaves the decision with the executive (and the voters) rather than the judiciary, but I don't think people feel too many obligations to non-citizens anyway - look at the way we skirt international law regarding refugees, and most people are comfortable with that. Despite the protestations of the legal lobbyists, we're also comfortable with ministers having discretionary, irrevocable powers over visas too. It's farcical, pie-in-the-sky idealism of lawyers to insist that non-citizens should have the same rights, or even the same access to our legal system as citizens. Voters have drawn the line at permitting the judiciary to make determinations on non-citizens in all sorts of areas, and the community regards this as an uncontroversial aspect of the concept of sovereignty despite the fear-mongering of officers of the court, who regularly overstate and exaggerate this phony 'problem' of injustice in a western democracy.

The other side of the coin is when we prosecute Australians for breaking our laws in other countries- sexual offences, drugs & arms smuggling, as examples. If an Australian, of single, duel or triple nationality commits a crime under our law, here or abroad, then we should prosecute them.Besides, if criminal justice is to have any deterrent value then threatening to take away the passports of terrorists is hardly going to make anyone think twice.

26 Feb 2015 12:48:42pmDove,Lovely to talk again.Perhaps society should take a different approach.Instead of attempting to provide an ambulance at the bottom of the cliff (by stripping citizenship or jailing people for committing crimes/engaging in terror activities overseas) we should focus on placing a barrier at the top of the cliff, as in we remove the desire to go overseas and kill other human beings due to being indoctrinated by religious belief systems.Perhaps the answer is in preventing religions from being allowed to indoctrinate children and those who have not attained the age of legal capacity to provide informed consent.If we did this then relgious believers would reduce in number (as it is extremely difficult to indoctrinate someone with mental capacity) and therefore there would be fewer people with an inclination to and commit murder/crimes in the name of their said religion.ps. yes, I fully appreciate that in reality few western believers go and actually do this, but the point that religious indoctrination should not be allowed on those without the ability to provide informed consent stands.Kind regards and I hope you have a great day.

26 Feb 2015 1:20:19pmThe pleasure is always mine, Joe. I see your point, it makes sense but I think it might come apart both in the implementation and marketing phases. People are entitled to be idiots, be it tattoos, green hair, Bob Dylan records, voting One Nation, smoking or painting your toddlers face in your team colours to indoctrinate them. Parents have a right to likewise indoctrinate their children with their beliefs, after all,most others do so, albeit for a limited time with Santa Claus.

After all who wants to hear that their belief system is fundamentally flawed and flawed to such a point that it would be a criminal offense to subject those incapable of making informed consent to it.Yes, our species will always contain risk takers (smoker and one nation voters) and those that are so desperate to be 'individuals' (with tats, green hair and hippie albums) so they can fit in with their peer group.Fortunately the pagan beliefs relating to the Santa Claus mythology don't generally lead to calls for jihad etc in adult life and are so flawed that even children incapable of providing informed consent can see the flaws within the mythology (the red nose on the reindeer is the give away, until that point came up the myth was entirely believable).Please do come back to me with a response if you ever come up with a reason why children should not have a right to be protected from indoctrination.Kind regards

26 Feb 2015 2:21:23pm'why children should not have a right to be protected from indoctrination.'Some would say teaching a child their is no God is indoctrination, so it all ends up in the eye of the beholder. I was raised as a Catholic, at home and 13 years of Catholic schools,and by my early teens realised it didn't make the slightest bit of sense and gave it up all by myself. Millions have done the same so childhood indoctrination doesn't automaticaaly lead to a bad outcome. Living in a multicultural society with good education and seperation of Church and State would seem a good defence against radicalisation.But, how would you implement your plan ?. Banning things often makes them more attractive, and makes the 'believers' even more likely to cling to the ideas and/or become even more extreme and violent as they feel they are oppressed. People just don't like being told what to think, not overtly anyway.  If people have religious beliefs they will teach them to their children in their homes, no matter waht the law or the rest of society says.So to your question on an idealistic level I don't think that children should be allowed to be brainwashed, but on a practical level it is impossib;e to implement. The best we can do is to encourage moderate beliefs and practices. As somewhere said elsewhere extremism is the problem, not the belief.

26 Feb 2015 3:14:01pm"Some would say teaching a child their is no God is indoctrination" - quite true, but generally limited to those that seek to indoctrinate a religion into their children.Science is a process, a method. It isn't indoctrination. For example note how 'science' has stated today in the ABC that they need to work some more on the laws of physics as a supermassive black hole 12 billion times more massive than our little sun existed in the early universe when theoretically it shouldn't have under currently understood laws of physics. This demonstrates it is just a method of discovery, not a system of belief.Glad to hear indoctrination didn't work on your either.People can still believe that a Canaanite demi god from a polythiestic iron age mythology is the one and only true god, or that a space warlord in a space ship dumped the souls of the dead into a volcano on Earth (which is why people have a bad day some times so they say).What we should be seeking to do is to protect the children, the weak and the vulnerable from predatory behaviours by religious bodies.From a practical point of view the law should prevent religious organisations etc from activitely seeking to indoctrinate people who are unable to provide informed consent (due to a lack of mental capacity), ie. kids. For example 'alpha courses' are generally a primary method for beginning the formal indoctrination process. Such courses could be simply banned in the same way we ban 'grooming' by pedophiles etc. You could go a step further and place an age limit on entry to religious organisations / buildings in the same way we do with bars. We ban kids from bars until they attain the age of consent, the same rule can be applied to temples/churches etc.The problem is the belief, as without the belief system there wouldn't be the extremism associated with the belief, or the implied consent of those that share the belief (but not the exremism) by virtue of simply sharing the belief, ie millions of others believe in XYZ therefore I can't be wrong.ps. I also agree that 'moderate' beliefs should be encouraged, which is a polite way of saying "we don't really believe, and just pick out the bits we like, but we would like to hedge our bets just in case heaven is real".

26 Feb 2015 5:06:57pmYou talk logic, which is fine, but logic doesn't work on nutters, so I still can't see us any time soom being able to ban children from being taught/indoctrinated with religious beliefs. I'd be happy to be wrong.And I'll stick with the belief is not the problem, extremism is. There have been plenty of extreme belief systems not based on religion which caused great harm. We could even get new ones, like eco-terrorists and so forth. To me moderate means more like "I believe X, and I might even try talking you into believing X, but I would not forcibly impose it on you, or do you harm if I can't convince you".I am hopeful that humans will continue to evolve and we will leave all this religious nonsense behind one day, but I think it will be thousands of years, not decades or even hundreds. Once again, I hope I'm wrong about the timescale.

26 Feb 2015 4:54:05pmThe "way of life/religion", "islam/muslum,koran", is taught to the "children" and must be indoctrination, or why do these people, Australian born, even, become "radicalized" and want to join these violent groups fighting overseas, send their young girls to marry when in Australia such would be "illegal", want their ancient/horrible laws to be accepted by Australians, etc? Australia has living standards, these people say they want a new way of life, in a modern, "free" country/world, why they say they want to come to Australia, therefore, become part of Australian society and live as Australians do NOT bring their way of life here and expect Australia to accept it. Bring the children up in the Australian community as Australian citizens. Australia educates them, protects them and their health. Anyone who wants to become an Australian Citizen should NOT have alliance to any other country. NO dual citizenships or NO Australian benefits.

26 Feb 2015 7:37:19pmTreason is currently still on the books.  In most Australian jurisdictions, treason is punishable by life imprisonment. Knowingly providing a traitor with assistance is considered an act of treason in itself, unless the aid was humanitarian in nature. If you become aware that someone is planning an act of treason and fail to report it to the authorities, it will earn you a 20 years sentence in some jurisdictions.

26 Feb 2015 12:32:28pmThere is merit in revoking Australian citizenship from those who have it and another citizenship, if the circumstances are appropriate.  (There is also merit in suggesting Abbott revoke any citizenship he may have besides Australian citizenship.)Its application should not be automatic but dependent on circumstances, including the circumstances of the country of residual citizenship, and country of primary citizenship is relevant.Regardless, it is clear this measure would have very limited impact and its prominence in publicity has more to do with looking tough than actually being thoughtful or effectual.

26 Feb 2015 12:38:55pmThe notion of dual citizenship is problematic in these circumstances anyway.If a person is permitted to hold dual citizenship, there must be a potential for a conflict of interest.Dual citizenship has significant (travel) benefits, but, in reality, can a person be expected to declare and maintain concurrent loyalty to more than one country?Let's be clear; we aren't talking about residency.As I understand it, citizenship is awarded when a person declares fealty to the country awarding it.The problem for the country, and the dual citizens, arises when, as now in Syria, Iraq, etc. one set of loyalties subsume the interests of the other. Similar situations arose when the former Yugoslavia imploded, and Australian citizens went off to be involved in that conflict.By awarding citizenship to a person who is not required to surrender other citizenship(s) the Australian government implicitly recognises the person's right to express loyalty to other sovereign authorities.It therefore seems reasonable to assume, that to strip someone of Australian citizenship for exercising a recognised (potentially) conflicting loyalty could be open to legal challenge, given the ready availability of dual citizenship in the first instance

26 Feb 2015 1:46:51pmDual citizenship has significant (travel) benefits, but, in reality, can a person be expected to declare and maintain concurrent loyalty to more than one country?As a dual citizen I can answer this question. Whilst it is unlikely that my country of birth will ever be in such a conflict with Australia I can honestly answer that were it to happen my dual citizenship isn't what would get in the way of any loyalty. I still have relations in that country and that alone would mean that my loyalty would be challenged regardless of whether I retained my birth nationality or not. In the end it would depend on the cause of the conflict and my personal views on whether it was right or wrong. That said, if the same conflict occurred with a country other than my birth country then my answer would be the same. I suspect that many would hold the same view.

It makes employment, taxation and travel easier but that bit on the passport that says "without let of hindrance" is just rhetoric. Being a citizen can let you vote, but that's hardly anything to covet. Having a passport does not make zinc cream, vegemite or loyalty to an old English woman any more compulsory than being to loyal to the head of the Vatican state is for Catholics.These are all abstract concepts that are very elastic depending on the age, ethnicity and preferences of the individual.If someone can legally work here, they pay their way, they obey the laws then I don't care if they have ten passports or know the words to Old Man Emu or not

27 Feb 2015 12:51:40pmThe problem is, loyalty begins at childhood. To create a loyal citizenry, you need to teach these values to children the moment they start school.Perhaps what should be done is to have a special class for all primary and high school students to teach them loyalty. To make things fun, the kids could wear special uniforms, take part in parades and even be given ranks they can aspire to. Those who refuse to take part can be encouraged by their peers to do so and taught the mistake of their ways.The older generations will be lost, but if the younger generations are taught in time, within a few decades we could have a loyal, obedient nation without the conflict and chaos we have now.

26 Feb 2015 1:57:04pmHow about we seek to reduce nationalism and the problems associated with nationalism world wide?The clear benefit associated with dual or multiple citizenships is that there is a lesser degree of fealty to any given country, and a lesser emotional response to nationalism (and all its ugly facits).I am a strong advocate for human beings obtaining as many citizenships as possible (not only to facilitate travel globally) so that our species transcends notions of nationhood and nationalism and begins to accept all humans are equal and that we share one very small and insignificant blue planet in a very large and unforgiving universe.In the west we have arguably escape from the bonds of tribalism, we are also arguably escaping the bonds of religious affiliation as well, .... and once we escape nationalism and accept we are all just Earthlings the better it will be for everyone.

26 Feb 2015 2:47:51pmJoe, I agree, nationalism is fundamentally childish and reflects some misguided concept of an enlarged tribe. In our case, it justifies why we have much, and most of the world has little. I am widely travelled, and folks are folks, wherever you go. If you increase living standards, provide moderately competent government and services, then one does not find many fools willing to die for a dubious cause.  This applies to the Caliphate as much as to marxism or fundamentalism. You can't fix the ( relatively few)  fools leaving Australia to fight: they should be charged with crimes if applicable on their return.  Mostly they will end up dead - they reputedly do not play well with the locals and are sent as cannon fodder. How removing their passports will deter them leaving is anyone's guess. Daesh is bad.  But it is a long way away and none of our business - we have no power to fix anything, just to kill people.
Alert moderator
26 Feb 2015 4:04:38pmWithout expanding on the nationalism points made, my comments/questions relate more to shifts in perception of when a citizen is seen to have transgressed.If a dual-citizen travels to his/her "other country" and participates in activities not seen to be criminal in that other country, why ought the Aust govt have the right to criminalise those actions?Remember that by granting Aust citizenship without a condition of renouncing or qualifying the "former" citizenship, the govt is implicitly accepting (even condoning) that person has other loyalties.The major point I am trying to establish is that we are complicit in the conundrum created for some,  and we are now, retrospectively, trying to place conditions on the citizenship so easily acquired.

To get citizenship, one uncle had to advertise in the local newspaper just in case anyone wanted to object.

Alert moderator
26 Feb 2015 3:05:50pmIf there was ever a question I was asking myself as I wrote that poorly spelt effort above "polYgamy', you read my mind, Joe.A person born in Australia is Australian.  That's a two-way street, just like frozen berries.  To the child, it's identity, and to the country, it's produce.  It is logical for one's origin to determine the nationality of the integral being, be they animal, vegetable, or for the sake of argument, mineral.Having ancestors who are not Australian is part of our globalization efforts.  I think it is a good thing, but I don't think dual-citizenship is a good thing in anyway at all.  One life, one country.  Dual-citizenship is greedy beyond all the money ever coined or printed.  It's a false identity.  It's fraud.  If you are Joe Bloggs, then you are Joe Bloggs, one.  That's where I stand on the whole issue.  Regarding your question, both my sons have ancestral linkage to their mother's (same mother) parents' countries of origin.  If either of my sons were to try to get dual-citizenship because of that immigration history, then maybe they might have valid reasons, but they would become half-Australians.  One times one does not equal two.If either of my sons were to procure dual-citizenship, and get a parking ticket in Fremantle (exaggerating) then I would hope that their Australian citizenships would be revoked.  They would still have another country to call their new home - that's one of the few wonders of dual-citizenship.  I can't think of any others.Ideally, the place where a human is born is their country, and maybe they can trade one for another, but not double.  In this unfortunate situation where Australians obtain citizenship of other countries and still keep their original, then *take the original.   It's wrong, but the system is wronger.* take AWAY the original.

26 Feb 2015 6:50:46pmWow.  I love your optimism, fellow earthling.  Sad to say, I see it as a kind of ill-informed naivete. Just look at Europe, look at Syria/Iraq and the middle east.  Indonesia to the north is a potential invader. If it gets militarised and moneyed-up from Saudi, it may not be such a far-fetched idea. With the way its going, conflict against our fellow humans is inevitable - it seems to me we will have to fight if we wish for our brand of western, liberal democracy to exist in the future.  It may be - if we don't find the guts to fight, and continue on with the lethargic, 'it's all good' attitude - that we are the ones wiped out, in favour of an Islamic state militant state. This may bring a kind of stability of sorts with everyone left under the iron fist of Islamic nutjobs, but possibly not the one you'd envision in your earthling imaginings. I reckon it's worth fighting for the liberal, western democratic ideal, where the girls won't have to wear a black bag or be subject to intolerable deprivations and abuse because they are female; one in which  science is not ignored in favour of obscure rants written by an 8th century pedophile; or one in which cartoonists are murdered for drawing an image of an imaginary friend.  Just wanting and wishing for a utopian ideal, doesn't make it so. We've got to get the guts to stand up to it, and fight it.  Fellow earthling.

27 Feb 2015 10:57:52amHello Twintowns.As for war and invasion on a massive scale, .... I would simply refer you to the concept called "M.A.D." which ensures only small scale proxy conflicts occur. So no need to concern yourself with armada's of Dhows with bearded Barbary pirates arriving on our shores.May I also point out that western culture has triumphed, not because of our superior weapons systems, but because it is a successful culture and one others seek to emulate. For example in London I worked with Sunni, Shite, Sikh, Jains, Hebrews, Christians (all traditional enemies) and other atheists. And we all got along just fine, as we all wished to live within and adhere to western cultural norms. Similarly the cold war was won not with weapons but with culture. It is our culture that provides us with strength, and it is the fundamental tenants of our culture we must protect in order to keep our culture strong. It is all about "hearts and minds" dear friend.....ps. Perhaps you also weild your tar brush too liberally?

27 Feb 2015 12:44:51pmHPH,I'd perhaps suggest that no real direct attempt was made to win the Hearts and Minds of the folks in Iraq and Afghanistan. But overtime, western culture will continue to permeate into the internal culture of Iraq and Afghanistan.The conceptual idea of "Hearts and Minds" also doesn't necessarily have to be a direct and immediate PR / Propaganda campaign (ie. as being waged by the Russian Federation in relation to their Ukrainian campaign), but more of how western culture triumphed over Communism/Personality Cults during the last century, or how the key tenants of liberty, freedom etc dreamed up thousands of years ago in Greece and Rome survived military conquest/defeats of those nations. Just look at the world around you and the people within it, what do the individuals aspire to? western notions of freedom/liberty? or totalitarian dictatorships? (note how i mention individuals and not those in power/control).That is what I mean by 'hearts and minds'.Kind regards

26 Feb 2015 5:22:43pmYes, JoeBloggs, they should. Obtaining another citizenship should automatically void their Australian citizenship. A man cannot serve two masters, as the quote goes.

27 Feb 2015 7:00:53amFebruary greetings, reaver. I believe that 'national loyalty' is an Edwardian throw-back. People live across, travel and work to and from countries, many of which are the creation of arbitrary map making in the days of empires. Nationality isn't always clear cut and it's meaning varies greatly from person to person. It's not like choosing to become a life member of the footy club- it's something you pick up as an accident of birth. Having a sporting team and bad song doesn't create social cohesion, and many people will never feel loyalty to their country. I never have. But what does that mean anyway? People can be law abiding, contributing team players on our island without needing to....well, do whatever it is people think that loyal people should do
Alert moderator
27 Feb 2015 8:50:34amAs with everything about me, Dove, this is about practicality. When I write loyalty I do not mean it as an abstract concept. The primary asset of citizenship is the vote, the right and ability to participate in the political life of a country and decide who runs it and the policies those people are likely to have. This is not so important when things are good and everything is going well, but when the excrement hits the fan someone with a guaranteed bolt-hole to escape to will vote differently to someone who will be stuck with the consequences of their vote. When an election really matters the outcome will be different when a significant part of the voting public can pillage the system and then do a runner.

We used to work for a corporation for life.... now that attitude does not exist (and for the better for all), perhaps in time 'citizenship' will be as etheral as 'corporate loyalty'.

Two key decisions were made that gravely jeopardized US chances for success in Iraq: (1) the decision to bar fromGovernment work Iraqis who ranked in the top four levels of Baath Party or who held positions in the top three levels of each ministry; (2) the decision to disband the Iraqi Army and replace it with a new army built from scratch. These two fateful decisions were made against the advice of military and CIA professionals and without consulting important members of the President?s staff and cabinet.Both of these decisions fuelled the insurgency by: (1) alienating hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who could not support themselves or their families; (2) by undermining the normal infrastructure necessary for social and economic activity; (3) by ensuring that there was not sufficient security to carry on normal life; and (4) by creating insurgents who were angry at the US, many of whom had weapons and were trained to use them.Americans hauled 30,000 wrecked Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) back to Kuwait before pulling out most of their troops.

26 Feb 2015 1:18:07pmCitizenship of multiple countries is encouraged by most advanced Western democracies as it improves trade and cultural exchange. Cosmopolitanism at its best.Stripping people of their citizenship is an blatant end-run around the principle of the equality under the law by making the laws otherwise protecting their welfare effectively disappear.If we want extraterritorial laws to kill Australian dual-citizens overseas, we should explicitly discuss such laws and add them as and when agreed upon. Avoiding the discussion of what type and magnitude of extraterritorial jurisdiction is appropriate is hardly fair or reasonable.

I think it might be time to do away with Permanent Residency as well or at least extend that to 5 years.I think the same should also apply to some forms of residential real estate (citizens only).

Only radicalised killers are allowed to return to their country of citizenship, with specific instructions to continue the ISIL fight back in the countries of their citizenship. Therefore, fear not, no 'good guys' would ever be affected by stripping of citizenship under this law.

It doesn't follow that it is society's priority to keep them, or the terrorist's priority to remove them. You're confusing Australia's struggle against terrorism with your own personal struggle to keep your privileges.

If we start making exceptions to the Rule of Law, just what is it we are fighting for?Take David Hicks. He did some very stupid, morally reprehensible things. He collaborated with people who's goal is to destroy democracy and freedom. Now, in order to fight these enemies, we tinkered with the Rule of Law. No matter how morally unjust it was, he won the legal fight, precisely because we suspended the Rule of Law. It's a very important lesson we don't dismiss as being an aberrant outcome. It was a just outcome. I'm not arguing it was right. I'm arguing that if we toss aside the things that give us the peace, stability and justice we enjoy because our enemies have done so, what is it we're fighting for?

27 Feb 2015 11:29:05amJay. When our leaders talk about "values" and "way of life" they talk of simple things. Our right to be safe in the streets. Our right to implement our foreign policy without fear of consequence.The terrorists do not understand what civil liberties you have. They will not notice when they are gone, or celebrate when it happens. Most Islamic terrorists don't know what your "metadata" is or why you want it to be private. The obsession with civil liberties is yours, not the terrorists. The issue here is that you define "defeat" in the War on Terror as meaning you lose your civil liberties. As I said, it's because you're confusing Australia's struggle against terrorism with your own personal struggle to keep your privileges. They are two separate wars.

27 Feb 2015 12:07:14pmZing you say "As I said, it's because you're confusing Australia's struggle against terrorism with your own personal struggle to keep your privileges. They are two separate wars."I would suggest that in fact they are just one conflict.A conflict between competing cultures, and the most attractive culture will triumph in the end.Hense the need to protect the central tenants of our culture, our freedoms, privacy, liberty,... these are some of the aspect of our culture that make it so strong, attractive and powerful.In the end only a limited number of people will ever want to live within a 6th century religious doctrine based autocracy, whereas western culture will continue to influence and expand globally as others seek to emulate it or join in.After all consider how our western culture and the fundamental aspects of it has withstood the greatests of challenges ever since they were dreamed up by some fellows in Greece and Rome a fair time ago.As Aristotle put it so elequently "This, then, is one note of liberty which all democrats affirm to be the principle of their state. Another is that a man should live as he likes. This, they say, is the privilege of a freeman, since, on the other hand, not to live as a man likes is the mark of a slave. This is the second characteristic of democracy, whence has arisen the claim of men to be ruled by none, if possible, or, if this is impossible, to rule and be ruled in turns; and so it contributes to the freedom based upon equality".Our "privileges" are the bedrock of our culture, and must therefore be protected at all costs.

26 Feb 2015 1:47:13pmA powerful article.I am pleased to see common sense around this issue, at last we can see that there is a group of people who are without laws and want to harm others.We cannot see it as purely the rights of citizens.  There are those among us who have a sole purpose of violence and we need to make it as difficult as possible for them to flourish.My only other observation would be to realise there may appear to be a tiny minority of offenders, however, they operate within a family, a social group, community etc.  They are believing their behaviour is normal and justified because of the enabling that is occurring within these groupings.  This in my opinion requires the same amount of attention to limit travel etc.  There is nothing stopping supporters/family members doing the work for these individuals and I fear it is a bigger security risk than the just the ring leaders.  They have a following and we need to address their access to citizenship rights.

26 Feb 2015 2:55:44pmSome interesting facts here I had no idea about. While I might breathe a sigh of relief with the thought of somebody destructive to our society not being allowed to return to wreak havoc I have serious concerns about human rights issues. The Australian citizens whose citizenship are revoked are Australian citizens and should have all the same rights that other citizens have who have broken the law. I understand the difficulties of bringing someone to proper legal trial with the usual evidence of crime and wrong doing presented to a court of law etc but to free up drones to murder them disturbs me greatly. Is someone going to prove they have actually committed any serious crime before an American drone blows them away? Is there going to be absolute proof they have joined Is before citizenship is revoked? Who can guarantee some young vulnerable son or daughter caught up in this horror is not mentally ill and in need of treatment? What damage is this going to do to us on Australian soil amongst the community that the citizen grew up in(if they did)? I believe there is a major clash starting between old and new ideas, unbending religion and atheism that was inevitable at this stage in our evolution and our responses to it and how we deal with these things is going to have a big impact on who we are as humans in the future. The old ways of responding to violence (or enabling violence to occur) have to be rethought constantly. That is not to say we leave ourselves vulnerable to violence but we must be very careful we are not ensuring a future full of it

There is nought to seperate him from any other ISIL fighter besides his grieving family he callously left in Australia were he killed. Unfortunately his family's pain is not enough reason to spare such..

26 Feb 2015 4:19:41pmPerhaps more concerning is the broader legal implication for any Australian Citizen born overseas. This legislative change will mean that all Australians are equal - except those born here are more equal than those born elsewhere. That's not how I interpret my citizenship - granted 40 years ago. As far as I know, I am an equal to all Australian Citizens. Australian Citizens born in the Europe/US/Canada/Asia for example could find themselves accused under this regime and denied the rights of their Australian Citizenship, while an Australian born person accused of the same offence would not. If citizenship of Australia by birth somehow results in different rights to those who have it from naturalization, then lets spell that out right now, and see what happens when the millions of Australians born overseas vote at the next Federal Election.

26 Feb 2015 5:34:41pmYou misunderstand the proposal, David. This would only effect dual citizens. If someone with a foreign citizenship took up Australian citizenship then the situation would be the same as if they had been born an Australian citizen and took up a foreign citizenship. If this were implemented it would not effect anyone who had been a foreign citizen and had either renounced their foreign citizenship when they became an Australian citizen or who had their foreign citizenship automatically revoked when they became an Australian citizen. Citizenship by birth should be equal to citizenship by naturalisation, but if you want to become an Australian citizen it should be a choice between being an Australian citizen and being a citizen of another country. There should be no option to be both.

26 Feb 2015 4:28:41pmAbbott made the statement recently that a lot of people who go overseas to fight are on some type of Centrelink benefit. As usual he sees a need to tighten up on Centrelink benefits- what a surprise. Perhaps the problem is that these people are in Australia and have failed to succeed because lack of education, culture or whatever. Finally along comes IS and gives them a purpose - a reason to live- or die.Perhaps if they had been successful in Australia and had a job, car, house and all the other things employed people aspire to they might be less prone to accept extremism as a solution to their failed livesI am on the dole myself and know others in the same boat. Its hard to get motivated when all your job applications are rejected- if they even respond. Luckily I am 60 YO and have all the good stuff I need.

Nobody gets the dole overseas unless they have a good canoe and paddle at olympic standards.Pension is different.  You can get a month overseas on DSP, and if you're on the old-age pension, you can do what you like.  Luckily, there's not much killing you can do overseas in a month on the DSP after you deduct the costs of airfares, visas, postage, taxi fares to the airport, and inflight snacks.If you're old, you can fight as long as you like, but you're still old and nobody cares what you do or where you go.The whole centrelink terrorist statement is fiction.

26 Feb 2015 5:00:06pmMr Shanahan poses a hypothetical to support his case for stripping citizenship from Australian dual nationals.  Here is another hypothetical to consider.  An Australian, born here but with citizenship by descent of a second country, travels to a third country as part of an aid mission.  Intelligence suggests the mission gives aid to fighters of a terrorist group.  The government view is its citizen is providing support for terrorism and cancels his or her citizenship.  Stranded and unable to review the cancelation decision, the former Australian travels to the second country, without language, support or any connection.  What does Australia say to the government of the second country?  Now swap the second country and Australia in the scenario.  What would we say if the Australian citizen turned up here?

26 Feb 2015 5:38:47pmIf a country extends citizenship to an individual and does not withdraw it then that country must accept that individual, Jeroboam. If a country is not willing to accept the individual then it either should withdraw the citizenship or not have extended it to begin with.

26 Feb 2015 5:12:09pmWhy stop at just the extremists? There should be no dual citizenship at all. To become a citizen of a country is to declare loyalty to that country. To become a citizen of one country while remaining a citizen of another (or others) is to declare that you are kind of conditionally loyal, up to a point, maybe. If someone is eligible to be an Australian citizen let them be an Australian citizen and only an Australian citizen.

27 Feb 2015 11:46:12amI answer (IMHO):There is nothing about Australia that encourages young Australian men and women to support a barbaric horde such as ISIL. They are motivated by their ethnic loyalties, political aspirations and youthful idiocy which all gets reinforced by their specific version of religion. ISIL operates in Iraq and the Levant, thus the title. The overwhelming majority of the small number going are themselves, their family or their cultural identity, from Iraq and/or the Levant. It's not our fault. It's theirs. Their siblings, cousins, school chums, neighbours and mosque members aren't going. They are in a minority within their own minority. The fringe of the fringe, as ASIO calls them. Even in Iraq, the locals are staying away from ISIL in droves. Their local and international recruitment is pathetic. The world wide caliphate has less members than Collingwood. This must tell us something

When Australians are cowering under the fear of racism to show pride in their own nation, why do you think anyone else would respect Australia?If someone does not identify as belonging to Australia (or an Indigenous country within it) first, they should highly consider leaving this country.

26 Feb 2015 6:55:32pmThere is one issue with this. Under the conventions of which we are a signatory, you can't render a natural born citizen stateless. There is no law you can make that removes citizenship from it's natural born citizens.  It is also why cancelling a passport doesn't stop a natural born Australian from returning home under our laws.  One can certainly prosecute and jail them but this talk of making people stateless needs to stop. It shows a high degree of ignorance.  We don't remove citizenship from the worst criminals in the country. This doesn't mean we don't punish them. All this tough talk does nothing to make us more safe.

Mostly a bunch of stupid kids who traded their soft and privileged place in Australian society, for a quick dose of ISIS-style brutality - would they come back further radicalised, or would they feel chastened and in need of many years of PTSD treatment? As for those who would return to recruit people to the ISIS cause, surely ASIO would have a field day.

27 Feb 2015 5:51:38amThere are at least Three Fundamental issues from which Rodger appears to be hiding in this article - or is simply being INSENSITIVE, by following the line of  reasoning of Abbott government and Corporate media.First Unfounded assumption is that we have the Right to strip citizenship off the Muslim radicals before they are brought before a recognized International Court with Independent judges, with material proof that they have committed War crimes. Mere Allegations by Australian military authorities and Spy Agencies are NOT enough to convince any intelligent public that they had actually committed crimes overseas.Second Unfounded assumption is that the lives of Muslim radicals cannot be redeemed when and if they come back to Australia from their jihadist experience. Stripping them off their citizenship means that their lives have a negative value, even less than Zero, as far as society is concerned. - The case of David Hicks is the best evidence that lives of Muslim jihadist can be reversed - they can still have a positive value in society despite their experience as Muslim jihadists.Third Unfounded assumption is that by stripping them off their citizinship it will cause a damage ONLY to Individual jihadists - not including the members of their families who are still resident here, or their friends. - Indeed, for every Muslim radical that has had his citizenship cancelled you will have at least six persons who are living here with negative attitudes and behaviours toward Australians.Fourth Unfounded assumption is that the other Ethnic minorities in Australia will stay passive and indifferent if Muslim radicals lose their citizenship. - Ethnic minorities, especially from Europe, did NOT take Australian citizenship on the basis that each time Australian military engages in an Aggressive War Overseas they must show Loyalty to Australian Flag - even when Australian military may be killing their own people. - These Aggressive Wars can take shape anywhere - Not just in the Middle East! - Tomorrow it can be Ukraine, Poland, or Russia! I think all this amply demonstrates that Abbott government is being very keen on provoking even more ethnic tensions, intolerance, and distrust, across much broader spectrum of Australian society.

27 Feb 2015 2:41:51pmOtto Voss  I don't think you're on track.Re first assumption they can be stripped of their AU citizen ship without any concern about how bad they were as war crimes go. They broke a current law of going to zones that are expressedly forbidden. They make sure, as ISIS likes them to re strengthening their cause, getting recruits by their publicising personally via messages and even social media informing those in AU that they've gone to fight alongside for males or support for females ISIS. They also get tracked eventually via travel information confirming where they've gone.They are getting de citizened as a means for facilitating AU security  and local citizens safety.Re second assumption.David Hick's wasn't tangling with the likes of ISIS. Those who he tangled with have since decried the extreme barbarity of ISIS. Plus he was of western origins and wasn't as able to MIS-presume a middle Easten Muslim identity. It's more an underlying personality disorder that these current jihadists indicate in their type of dissafiliation with AU society. They have proved they have become trecherous with a sick side to revere butchers like ISIS. Sorry, their lives aren't likely to be of worth or have any constructive value to AU society. If any mainly misguided youth happened to follow a peer or sibling who sought ISIS, wasn't hardcore and ISIS got a wiff of any wobbles he'd be culled and never return.Third assumption doesn't fit the major responses of families where a family member went off to ISIS. The families have been devestated and disapproving. One parent even disowned his proginy over that.Otherwise yes these families hurt like crazy when hearing of their sons or daughters deaths. None have made any noises about AU legal reprecussions or are likely to turn on other AU society members over legal consequences.Some would find these family escapist too big  a problem and embarressment to have in their midst anyway. Fourth assumption, other ethnic minorities would in the main be pleased not to have AU allow a return of ISIS butcher extremist followers. ISIS are not a home based country at war, but terrorist invaders with global recruits. There are no parallels to incite any response ftom these ethnics. Sure a few may be confused and a touch perturbed, though if none of them are planning highly illegal activities or fighting in wars elsewhere they'd no they don't have a worry.No dual AU citizen who may have sympathetic feelings for their home country were AU ever at war with such ever face a threat to citizenship. It's active military involvement, by going or funding such that can become a promblem that most ethnics don't see themselves doing.Hence it's irrelevant.Hence you've utterly no sound basis for your strange view on the Abbott govt and aims in regard to AU and ethnic tensions.

27 Feb 2015 4:11:11pm@brigitte jones: - Firstly you said the reason for their losing the citizenship is because "they broke a current law of going to zones that are expressly forbidden by the government" If so then the possibility is that such a Law is a Bad Law! - Bad Laws made by the governments are not cut in stone, since bad laws violate Natural and Social laws, hence they are not Universal laws that anyone with a sense of Justice ought to obey.There is NO such Australian law that will forbid me to visit the land of my ancestors, or the land of my birth, wherever that may be, or whenever I see fit to go there! - In that case, the Australian government is overreaching itself not ONLY against the Muslim radicals, but against all Australian citizens of Ethnic origin.Because, given the Australian eagerness to wage Aggressive Imperial Wars all over the world, against all kind of nationalities, tomorrow "the expressly forbidden zone can be a country like Ukraine, Russia, Poland, China, Greece, or anywhere in the Balkans." Put simply, it is an UNACCEPTABLE condition of citizenship that ANYONE can be forbidden to visit the land of his or her ancestors, for whatever reason, simply because it is an order given to you, or to me, by the Australian military, or by a secret cabal of government spooks.

27 Feb 2015 6:32:42amFriends, I think there are a heck of a lot of "ifs" in this question, and there is a lot of potential for expedient political disinformation."Dual citizenship" is a very complex legal issue, and just as full of moral issues. I'm no expert in the area, but the regular implication that people shop around for or somehow exploit multiple citizenship is an expedient argument. There are countries who refuse to acknowledge that its citizen has renounced their citizenship.The truth is, the most common dual citizenships in Australia are British/Australian. I also refute the principle that someone who takes on Australian citizenship cannot be loyal without renouncing the citizenship of their birth.Look, I think ISIL is a revolting movement. I think we need to examine every tool in our toolbox to ensure their defeat and extinction. But I think making a broad, sweeping change with massive implications for citizenship In the name of combating a single threat is very dangerous. What I worry about is the unintended consequences. What would be the consequences of such a suite of laws if the Timor Leste (East Timor) situation happened tomorrow.We must be careful not to start tinkering with the Rule of Law in these situations. David Hicks, a man I think most would agree made some very foolhardy decisions, and chose to collaborate with enemies of freedom and democracy, has ultimately defeated the legal case against him, precisely because the Rule of Law was subverted for political expedience. Its an unimportant lesson we must not sweep aside as a perverse outcome. It was actually a just outcome, even though it was morally dubious.Any proposed changes must tick three boxes: 1) it must be morally defensible, 2) it must be legally defensible and consistent with the rule of law, and 3) it must consider all of the consequences, including a sunset clause.

27 Feb 2015 8:14:25amHard as it is to admit this, there is one thing that I agree with Tony Abbott.  ISIS is a death cult that is determined to kill any man or male child who is not willing to mindlessly join their cause which appears to be dictatorial rule and enslavement of men and the control of women as sex objects. But ISIL is a group of brainwashed fighters led by a small number of psychopaths.  Wherever communities feel oppressed or marginalized, the psychopaths and extremists are tolerated. This is what has happened in Iraq and Syria. The US military led a massive assault on Iraq with little understanding about the complexities of the nation that the UK had even more irresponsibly created in the 1930's.  Unlike the British though, the US went in gung- ho and killed up to 200000 human beings and traumatized  millions of children and the elderly on the false pretext of WMD.  Then the US handed over power to a Shiite led government who oppressed the Sunni minority. What a disaster. Ripe for ISIS leaders to use the resentment of the Sunni minority at their treatment by the US and by the Shiite led government. Muslims have also watched the destruction of Libya, Syria and Afghanistan. They watched as the US negotiated with everybody else except largely Muslim counties whom they bombed into submission. They watched as 2000 mostly civilians were killed in Gaza and nobody seemed to care. No wonder Al Quida and ISIL are still getting so much support even though they are clearly led by brutal people.  We in Aus, lock up our psychopaths. Almost half the long term prisoners in this country have psychopathic features or some personality disorder. We treat them in the prisons and make an effort to change their misguided thinking. They are Aus citizens and our responsibility. They are also dangerous to the public but they are our responsibility. The misguided young men and women who go to fight for ISIL need help, not alienation.  Most of them are no worse that criminal psychopaths in our country. Let us work with the Muslim community to treat these misguided young people instead of targeting Muslims as a group and creating more problems for our country by dividing people. We can deal with our criminals whether they are fighting for ISIL or local criminals shooting at people in our suburbs in Sydney and Melbourne. We do not ask whether our killers also have the right to a British passport. The real problem is the skewed thinking of the ISIL recruits and that is why we have trained mental health professionals in the country. Passing the buck to another country is behaving irresponsibly and childishly.

Not one of these articles ever hints of these illegal and immoral false flag wars for the benefit of Americas' hegemony.  Not once do we hear of the thousands upon thousands of  soldiers invading and occupying foreign Muslim lands under premeditated false pretences and outright lies.  Not once do we hear of the murdering of millions of innocent men, women, children and babies.  NOt once do we hear of the millions that that have been dispossessed of their land and property.  Not once do we hear of the destruction of the ecological destruction of their lands and the use of depleted uranium that is causing birth defects and abnormalities.  Instead the government highlights a handful of Australians defending their country of origin or simply defending the Muslims from Middle Eastern background declaring them illegal.  The hypocrisy and duplicity is appalling!  How would Australians feel if the Muslims did the same to us with false flag wars?  There is no dissent and there is no other topic that is allowed to be heard in this insane perpetual war called the Long war of 100 years of invasions and occupations by the 'Project of the New American Century'.And in whose name are we killing innocent people.  ISIS is merely another CIA-Mossad front to carve up the Middle East for a Greater  Zionist Israel.  People realised that al Qaeda was created by the CIA.  The backers are from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, the US, the UK, Israel and being trained in Jordan.  Your articles suppress specific information and there are many websites and news agencies that reveal this very fact.  Who has radicalised these Muslims in the first place?  The governments of the US coalition of the killing  and Australia have placed its citizens in harms way by their foolish and reckless actions.  We should not be getting entangled with those dangerous allies the Americans. This will probably be suppressed just like you have suppressed other responses in the past.

If they have no place to return to then they go into detention until they are relocated as the case with current refugees coming by boat.Importing problems through the immigration process is something no country should be bound by.

27 Feb 2015 5:11:35pmThe prospect of a dual-national being stripped of Australian citizenship and then killed through information exchange, which you think would be palatable to the public, amounts to extra-judicial state execution.    Your proposal of casual, convenient, state-sanctioned assassination is offensive.  In addition, consider Scott Morrison, our former immigration minister, and his affection for keeping "operational" (his definition) matters opaque to scrutiny, and the PM's contention that it's better to ask forgiveness than permission.  It would quite likely be decided that we (the public) don't need to know, or that official confirmation would be contrary to the national interest.  Official reaction to whistleblowers these days is vilification, demonization and criminalization.   The world is full of bastardry, and you're proposing that we join in - because  you think it can make us safer.  I disagree.
