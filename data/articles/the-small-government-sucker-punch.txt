By hiding behind the rhetoric of "small government" the right has managed to co-opt the functions of the state and bend them to the benefit of private firms and individuals at the expense of the majority of citizens, writes Tim Dunlop.Small government. It is meant to be the ultimate goal of right-wing politicians and their supporters."I don't want to abolish government," said US political operative, Grover Norquist, "I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub."Of course, this is nonsense. The right, every bit as much as the left, seeks to use the power of government to shape the world to its own ends. (Norquist himself makes Republican politicians sign a "no tax" pledge on threat of campaigning against them; less drowning them in the bathtub than handing them a towel as they get out of the shower.)The argument isn't about big government versus small government, but who government serves, the many or the few.Let's try to understand this.Neoliberalism, the contemporary form of capitalism which now dominates the world economy, is a utopian project that uses a paradoxical approach to government to help disguise its intentions. In the words of British academic David Harvey, neoliberalism......proposes that human well-being can best be advanced by liberating individual entrepreneurial freedoms and skills within an institutional framework characterised by strong private property rights, free markets and free trade.This doesn't mean making government small. It means reconfiguring it to serve private rather than public purposes:The role of the state is to ... guarantee ... the quality and integrity of money. It must also set up those military, defence, police and legal structures and functions required to secure private property rights and to guarantee, by force if need be, the proper functioning of markets. Furthermore, if markets do not exist (in areas such as land, water, education, health care, social security or environmental pollution) then they must be created, by state action if necessary...State interventions in markets (once created) must be kept to a bare minimum because, according to the theory, the state cannot possibly possess enough information to second-guess market signals (prices) and because powerful interest groups will inevitably distort and bias state interventions (particularly in democracies) for their own benefit.Or as author Nick Srnicek notes in his book, Inventing the Future: "A major task of neoliberalism has been to take control of the state and repurpose it."Whereas classical liberalism advocated respect for a naturalised sphere supposedly beyond state control (the natural laws of man and the market), neoliberals understand that markets are not "natural". Markets do not spontaneously emerge as the state backs away, but must instead be consciously constructed, sometimes from the ground up. Under neoliberalism, the state therefore takes on a significant role in creating "natural" markets [and] in sustaining these markets ... Neoliberalism demands that the state defend property rights, enforce contracts, impose anti-trust laws, repress social dissent and maintain price stability at all costs...The unprecedented interventions by central banks into financial markets are symptomatic not of the neoliberal state's collapse, but of its central function: to create and sustain markets at all costs.So this is the key matter to understand: the rhetoric of neoliberalism is anti-government, but the practice of neoliberalism is to use government to deliver neoliberal outcomes.Everything from education to water and electricity services are privatised and operated on a for-profit basis for the benefit of private owners.To use David Harvey's stark explanation, what we have seen is the "stealing back of privileges...such as pension rights, health care, free education and adequate services that underpin a satisfactory social wage" and this "has become a blatant form of dispossession rationalised under neoliberalism and now reinforced through a politics of austerity ministered in the name of fiscal rectitude."Examples of this process are endless, but we can illustrate with a quick example.In Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Europe, government employment services were amongst those that were forced to adhere to this new market logic.Australia went further than most in fully privatising these services. The process began under the Keating Labor government in 1994, and was completed by the conservative government of John Howard.In the book, Getting Welfare to Work, a recent history of this process, the authors note that "instead of acting to restructure the labour market ... the Keating Government turned to the Australian welfare system as its locus of reform."The biggest change in approach was that they decided to......stimulate job placements by bringing in private agencies who were thought to have better links to employers. Those agencies would also have greater scope to decide how to assist each individual in a model designed to give the jobseeker more choice.Or so the rhetoric went. What actually happened?In place of a formula of programs and requirements, each new agency would innovate to obtain the best results and thus earn the highest profits. They were to operate in a competitive market environment and payment was based on employment or training placements for jobseekers on welfare rolls.But of course, neither the government nor the newly invented private employment agencies can actually guarantee anyone a job. Even if work is available, the final decision about who gets a given job remains with the employer.So because neither the government, who pays the private agencies, nor the agencies themselves, can actually guarantee someone a job, they use the only metric they have, which is to ensure that the unemployed are "actively seeking work".As the authors note: "What these program designers could control was the nature of the employment service interactions," so that "job seeker motivation was to be viewed as the primary driver of outcomes" (my emphasis).So as employment services were privatised, the demands on the unemployed to show that they were "motivated" increased. They had to apply for X-number of jobs per week, to make themselves available for training, to learn new skills, to attend classes in writing CVs or interview techniques, and a range of other requirements designed to render job-seeker motivation visible and therefore measurable.The privatised employment agency became an agent of government control while the role of government changed from provision of welfare to one of surveillance.It is "small government" as Big Brother.So this is where we are: the role of government is less about the provision of welfare through the redistribution of national income - the traditional welfare state - than it is about the creation of markets in areas where markets were once considered unnecessary, if not outright harmful.In other words, by hiding behind the rhetoric of "small government" the right has managed to co-opt the functions of the state and bend them to the benefit of private firms and individuals at the expense of the majority of citizens.We are told government has to cut back on health, education, childcare, infrastructure and other public services, while public money is funnelled to private businesses. All under the guise of "small government".It is the ultimate democratic sucker punch.Tim Dunlop writes regularly for The Drum and a number of other publications.

Comments for this story are closed.10 Mar 2016 8:25:54amThe glaringly obvious piece of information missing in this article was whether the new paradigm saved taxpayer's money or not.In relative terms, is paying numerous private agencies and their contractors cheaper or more expensive than it was when it was run by the government?If not, bring back the CES (Commonwealth Employment Service) and let's start saving some money.
Alert moderator
10 Mar 2016 8:49:27amI think you missed the point of the article. It doesnt matter if its cheaper or not if you dont get what you paid for. The authors point is when your main role is to make money you skew the metrics to suit. Who cares if the taxpayer saves a million dollars if it means less people are finding work. It reminds me of the newish vet-help scheme. Look what privatising the education system does. Already a couple of billion in debt, and all the tax payer has to show for it is a few dodgy diplomas accepted nowhere.
Alert moderator
10 Mar 2016 9:58:25amIf you are not getting what you paid for then your procurement and contract management isn't working.It doesn't actually mean the idea of privatising these services is wrong.If the private sector can deliver a cheaper and more efficient service then the only reason you would not go with them is ideology.**Note the "IF" at the start of that sentence however.
Alert moderator
10 Mar 2016 10:15:46amAnd there in that if lies the rub Freddie.  The private sector is never asked to compete with the public sector ("that would be unfair" they claim) and so we never see if they truly would be cheaper.Add to this that if a PPP project runs over "budget" (the cost that the private company promised they could deliver on) then it is the government, not the company, that has to foot the bill.
Alert moderator
10 Mar 2016 10:33:48amSounds fair, Freddie, but now we need a new version of ASIC to supervise if the deal is working and if there is any other supplier who could offer a better deal and to administer any transfer to the new deal. You could suggest using the existing ASIC, but it's so underfunded and toothless that the Coalition wouldn't trust it to supervise unions. As Mr Dunlop suggests, it isn't small government it's different government.
Alert moderator
10 Mar 2016 11:43:39amYou don't actually need anything like ASIC for individual areas, proper processes, tendering and contract management can do that for you. But only if those government agencies are competent enough to run those type of programs in the first place.If your suppliers are running roughshod over you as a client, it's a bit rich to blame the supplier for not delivering rather than looking closer to home. And it doesn't give any confidence that those government agencies could actually deliver the services better themselves. Neither option looks too good for the capability of government areas. 
Alert moderator
10 Mar 2016 12:51:25pmI get what you're saying, Freddie, and your points are valid. My point is that anything done on behalf of the Australian people must be selected, funded and supervised by some form of agency on behalf of those people. By its very nature it must favour the people over profit or it will fail its own purpose.There is plenty of research that compares the effectiveness of private service over public and the average is pretty much 50/50. There are some things the private sector does better and some things that work better with a public service. In the end, our society is better with a good mixture of some things being private (most aspects of day to day production and service) and some things being public (essentials including law enforcement, defence, education, water, electricity, emergency services, health, etc.)In my view there are some things simply too important to leave to a profit driven enterprise.
Alert moderator
10 Mar 2016 1:19:37pmChris L,I definitely agree that certain things are better achieved by government agencies due to their societal need, monopoly status or difficulty in attaching real, meaningful and enforceable KPI's to allow them to be run by private companies.But those decisions should always be decided on robust and defensible grounds rather than solely on ideological standpoints.If something is done better by private industry then we'd be stupid not to utilise them. If it's done better by the public sector, then it shouldn't be outsourced.
Alert moderator
10 Mar 2016 9:16:42pmFreddie:"If it's done better by the public sector, then it shouldn't be outsourced."My observation is that once some services e.g.  electricity, water, gas are outsourced, only to find that was a mistake, the redemption is too slow, not the least because of current ideology's inertia and the community's diminishing memories of how things were.  Individuals being paid dividends by the same bodies which provide them with costly services also add to the mix.  Genuine competition among such corporations is another factor which is not easily established.

10 Mar 2016 11:00:34amThe logic of it is that businesses cut the fat. And the fat is usually quality.In employment services, the fat is actually getting someone into a paid job or an apprenticeship or a traineeship.But to do this requires more effort. And effort costs money. And that money is coming out of the profits.Better to get the unemployed to do the work of looking for jobs, while the " employment agency " does none of the work and collects all of the money. Thats free enterprise.

Just like the new crooks at the TAFE fairground. And the old crooks at the unemployment fairground. Every crook wins a prize. By design, public servants are given no funding and no training  so that they cannot have a good close look at what is going on.

10 Mar 2016 12:46:26pm"If your supplier is not delivering you the value you require, is it really the suppliers fault that you are too incompetent to get them to deliver?"So, Freddy, what you're advocating is an Inspection Authority, with enough resources and staff, with the aim of ensuring that non-government contractors who have signed binding legal contracts with Government authorities actually fulfil their part of the contracts. The investigatory staff will need the similar kind of zeal and dedication to cleaning up business corruption ('cause that's what we're looking at) as the original FBI in the USA or their Treasury officials, like Eliot Ness, had at first when they set out to enforce Prohibition.Of course, there will be the usual outcry of "bloated bureaucracy" "nanny state" "government interference in business" and all the usual self-interested propaganda from businesses who just want to be allowed to continue leeching off the public purse and draining taxpayer funding to trouser private profits.But if there's enough political will from the electorate to put into pace a government which will DO that - it won't be a Liberal government, of course. It will have to start with an independent standing permanent commission with judicial and executive powers to authorise the deployment of the first-line of forensic accountants, auditors and enforcement agents. There will need to be back-room investigators to provide a list of potential miscreants for the Commission to decide on priorities.How do you propose to make the Commission, its funding and its staff safe from political interference by the business lobby party when it gets government again?I like  the plan.Do you really want to do this?
Alert moderator
10 Mar 2016 1:28:08pmMiowarra,are you suggesting that the government agencies are so incompetent that they can't manage contracts without an army of investigators and special agencies? You must really dislike public servants to believe they are that bad at simple business tasks. And it's just amazing how so many private companies don't seem to have issues with delivery at the levels you're talking about? They must be super efficient right?Either way, you'll note that I said that you would only go down that route if it was shown that it was more efficient. If you actually required that level of oversight, it would surely be more expensive and you wouldn't be privatising that area. Get it now?

10 Mar 2016 5:39:41pmI have never heard more left wing rubbish in my life. The point is this. These agencies are paid to get people into work. The one KPI that they must be measured against is how many unemployed they are successful in getting into work when compared against government agencies. You don't need an army of officious bureaucrats monitoring every action of these so called quangos.That said I  would wager these organisations are not fantastically successful at getting people into paid work and the reason has nothing to do with nasty nasty right wing neo cons or whatever other stupid term Left Wing numptys wish to spew at them.Thee real reason lies with the destruction of  our society by Leftist Whitlam endless welfare statism. If a person has no desire to work  then no matter how good your job agencies are they will never find work unless there is a big stick at the end of it. Believe me this nation consists of millions of bludgers with no desire to work and have been living high on the hog for decades in many cases. In the Northern suburbs of Adelaide where I grew up  and in the particular street I rented in while completing my last year at University not one bludger worked. In fact I was the only idiot working as a welder which was a constant source of mirth amongst those I lived with. The only solution is enforced work for the dole or compulsory military service. As I have seen in so many countless cases when you let someone rot on the dole then promote them on to disability support for spurious reasons and let them stay there for years they lose the will to work, they lose self discipline and they lose any sense of self esteem. Drug and alcohol addiction are in many cases the only outlet.Whitlam's Leftist policies are to blame  and you lot are the most destructive of forces that are sending this nation to oblivion. I could recount case after case after case of folk that just can't be bothered it makes my blood boil.Lefty's YOU are the problem and it is YOU I blame for the parlous state of welfare sickness that sucks the spark and energy out of this over Governmented over bureaucratised nation. Punch On.

Those in your street whom you denigrate presumably weren't.  Maybe they were all ne'er do wells who were too lazy to give things a go, maybe they never  had the breaks you might have - one lucky chance at just the right time, for instance.In any event, you maybe have every right to your self esteem.  No system or ideology gave you that.  As well, all systems and ideologies produce their share of people who do not prosper.  It's the way of things.

11 Mar 2016 9:28:39amhave you dealt with these agencies?The agency i was dealing with was useless. Never any suggestion of helping me find work in any way ( too old, too regional) so, while i was looking I offered to build them a database for free to help match up  local skilled people and build up a contract work register. I thought we could organise to bring some work into the area through them. they refused as it was "outside their contractual obligations".If i would just sign my contract and show them my list of job applications?Centrelink all ready polices this. The job agencies are completely redundant. they want a fee when you find your own work though. I'm all for work for the dole, but none of this slave labour rubbish. Short term contracts, standard pay. Give people an opportunity to see what if feels like to earn and spend your own money, or to use your skills. Then if they are good on the short term contracts, help them find longer ones.presuming of course, that work is there in the first place.

It's kind of like a company pension system that allows you to steal from indiviudal pensioners.

10 Mar 2016 11:53:56amFreddie small govt is why govt procurement and contract management is failing . Due to the mantra of small govt the number of experts employed by the govt to check costings and contracts are reduced often leaving checking of contracts to be contracted out to private companies many have links to companies they are supposed to scrutinise.This was an issue with Labor's Buibing School Halls stimulis program . Garretts dept assumed State govts had the expertise and numbers of inspectors to scrutinise the contracts  , however with most state Govts virtually closing down their Public works Depts and contracting out those service , State govts lost the building expertise needed to make sure the contracts were cost effective .Its just like the Fed govt wanting to reduce the mining industry be self regulated to cut costs , the companies often just tick and flick the reports saying everything is fine, but the govt has lost the scientific expertise to analyse the data . Saves money for the company and govt in the short term but costs the Govt and people a lot more in the long term.

Things like "efficiency" dividends have absolutely zero to do with small government.Small government would be identifying the right amount of people needed with the right skills to deliver your core business and then employing those people. Anything outside of your core business can be left to the private sector.

10 Mar 2016 1:33:34pmPrivatising services introduces a middleman and profit layer. It can only be cheaper if you cut wages. Unfortunately, as soon as you have private operators, dodgy practices creep in; see security industry issue on 7:30, NSW/Queensland. It follows that you need overseers, probably more than you had before and if these are privately contracted they need to be paid really well to be strict and not corrupt.People are presenting small government like a religion. I see government as 'delegating'. Not everybody wants to fund and house the elderly in their own flat, so pension contributions and aged care facilities are delegating the task. If you don't want to prepare your children for the HSC yourself, you delegate and pay for it. Not all wages are  big enough for private schools, so taxpayer $ ensure that we don't get masses of analphabets. Just take the emotion out of it and call it delegating.

10 Mar 2016 2:49:39pmThe problem Freddie is this, there comes a point where there are no more efficiencies to be found, and any further cutting impacts on the level of service or product that is supplied. It's very easy to say 'be more efficient', much harder to do it in practice without affecting the levels of service or quality of product. It's surpringly easy to become so efficient that you put yourself out of business, or in the case of government services so 'efficient' that you no longer provide the services you were tasked to. Through no fault of my own I was forced to go into Centrelink the other day. They were so 'efficient' I had to wait over an hour to be seen. They have managed to become so efficient by marching their most knowledgeable staff out the door. They are no longer 'efficient' Freddie, they are now highly inefficient.

On each occasion he had to wait on the phone for someone to answer, who then transferred him to someone else. In previous years this would never have occurred. My guy who didn't know the answer would have looked around the room, found a supervisor, called them over and voila, question answered. But more than this. The supervisor would have explained why the answer was 'x', and why to do next. My guy was never told why the answer was 'x', and I very much doubt the different people who he spoke to knee why the answer was 'x' either. So now my guy has given me an answer via a time consuming process whereby he won't realise that the answer is 'x' the next time someone else asks the same question I just did simply because the next person used slightly different phrasing than I just did. That's the very definition of inefficient.

So efficiency would be a few penthouses and everyone living in tents in parks.A few smaller jets for billionaires is way more efficient than carting thousands around the world. etc.Neo liberalism is terrific is you are one of the few that benefit from all the efficiency.

10 Mar 2016 6:12:52pmUtter rubbish. Putting yourself out of business is not efficient. What puts so many businesses out of business is the endless Government meddling that gets worse and worse every year. I am trying to set up a business at the moment and the amount of Government legislation I need to comply with is absolutely infuriating! Government agencies could not care less -  they do not have to meet any real world performance targets, they monopolise so many markets and they act to create so much confusion and frustration that in many cases Government Departments actually work against each other to the detriment of the small business operator.   The GFC was caused by lax monetary policy expanding credit leading to asset bubbles and final collapse. Over the past 7 years Governments all over the world  have been stimulating their economies driving their stockmarkets through the roof. The hypocritical Wall Street brokers have gotten rich off this Leftist Keynesian madness.Meanwhile the true economy stutters along completely divorced from the stock market evaluation, sputtering from too much Government interference and bureaucracy. When will we ever learn and allow free markets to run without the curse of Government meddling and distortion.The government is my enemy.

10 Mar 2016 10:15:42amNice response fish.  Very perceptive and, in my view, right on the money (pun intended).Another example is the federal government's vocational education and training scheme which is estimated to have cost the taxpayer $6 billion whilst providing questionable outcomes and opening the door to serious potential for corruption.  For those who don't already know about this, check out ABC's Background Briefing's Program "The TAFE Plunder" (28 Feb 2016, https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/backgroundbriefing/2016-02-28/7193402).  It makes for very interesting listening, however, as a tax payer, it is likely to make your blood boil.The reality is, "small government" is any easily quoted mantra that completely belies the complexities of modern societies.  The private sector plays a vital role in a healthy society, but so does government.  The roles are different and important.  Get the balance wrong and, as the aforementioned Background Briefing program shows, things go bad very quickly.So I would suggest to anyone that if you hear a politician or lobbyist talk about the importance of "small government", be careful.  There is a lot of money to be made by ripping off the taxpayer, and their motives are not always admirable.

10 Mar 2016 11:11:09amI should have further added that given the content of the Background Briefing report, I am a bit bemused as to why this has not got more coverage, particularly through the commercial media and why the police have not got involved.  As David Morrison was quoted as saying, "the standard you walk past is the standard you accept".  It seems that as a society, we have accepted that individuals ripping of government programs is o.k.  I can't agree with such a standard.  Further, if the unions are subject to such scrutiny (and they should be), then why not the companies involved in the vocational education scam?  Is it to avoid governmental embarrassment, or is it something far worse?

10 Mar 2016 12:22:06pmAgreed.  An then there is the abandonment of mines by mining companies following the commodity market crash, now left to the tax payer to clean up.  No accountability what so ever.  And I am sure there are many others.  Yet the Australian tax payer is happy to be distracted by a GST debate, or "housing tax" or other such slogan that our current MP said he would not indulge in.  Is it any wonder we are taken for fools so often (i.e. taxpayers).  We might as well beg them to do it given our utter apathy.

10 Mar 2016 8:00:09pmActually, bees flap their wings inside the hive to circulate air and dry out the honey so it won't spoil - whether or not they're going to eat that particular patch of honey. And there are plenty of other examples of altruistic uses of wings and other appendages in nature. But our system rewards those who cut down others to get ahead, so that's who we get at the top.On the job services front, the fundamental problem is that there's no good measure of performance. If you reward companies for finding people jobs, then people with difficulties finding work get shuttled around because no-one wants to be holding the bad one. All sorts of "placements" and "interventions" and "training programs" get dreamed up to take people off the "idle" list, but all they do is cost a lot - and the taxpayer is signed up to foot the bill.

11 Mar 2016 3:36:30amMy take on the story Fish is that if the jobs are there, and the unemployed workers are there, it doesn't matter who the middle man is, the vacancies will be filled.That only leaves the question of which method is cheaper?
Alert moderator
11 Mar 2016 10:06:34amDumbing it down like that is actually not helping. In order to have a functional system you need employment, and in order to start the ball rolling on that we need some those jobs to actually produce something useful - not just endless house sales, or moving money. Then in order to help those industries flourishing a percentage of your workforce needs to be skilled - and they need the right skills - and they need to be able to keep those skills current and in good practice. It would make more sense to get rid of the job agencies as they stand - policing the paupers - as they serve no real purpose -  and create industry specific agencies that actually co-ordinate skills, jobs and training. Attach them to Tafe, or to University. Attach them to professional groups. Stop wasting people's time getting vulnerable people to compete at taxpayer's cost for jobs that arent there or that they are not suited to. Make them answer to the students - either they provide a certain number of industry specific jobs or they can be replaced. 
Alert moderator
10 Mar 2016 8:59:30amThe question shouldn't be how much it costs taxpayers, but how much it costs society - citizens as a whole.Because looking at costs to taxpayers encourages the externalisation of costs, pushing them somewhere else where those costs won't be counted as "costs to taxpayers".And this problem is at the heart of so much modern economics. We constantly cut down the easy to quantify costs and "save money", while pushing up the costs that are difficult to quantify and put a monetary value on, or belong to a different sector.

10 Mar 2016 11:05:46amThis article and Michael Bradley's are rather more significant fare than The Drum usually serves up.  Together they illustrate some of the consequences of the 'squeeze' of modernity which have thousands of analogues throughout all of our history.History is usually told in terms of the competition among potentates for power and posterity.  It is the re-tinted tale of the 0.1%.  But there is a groundswell under that story of the pressure building among ordinary people for relevance and a share in the 'product' of civilisations - which usually serve the purposes of power and potentates.Until perhaps 3/4 of a millenium ago, the occasional 'rebellions' of ordinary people were easily put down, but rebellions have threatened to become revolutions for more than 600 years now.  The Protestant Revolution, the English Revolution, the French Revolution, and their roots and the waves they raised, have battered the historical ways of potency but they have not out-smarted them.Practitioners of power have responded by letting a small number of the 'leaders' of these revolutions, and of their underlying thinking, into the station of the elite and they have infected/comverted them to the historical means by which power has prosecuted and preserved itself and its prelates.  Effectively, the leaders of revolution have been converted to something close to what ordinary people originally revolted against.  The sacrifice of revolutionaries is usually sold out, or mis-directed.In the 19th century the neocons of British and American Establishments baffled the hopes of French revolution to promulgate a pre-revolutionary model of civilisation onto the world for the next 200 years.  A real opportunity went begging.Now, our Economick Age has run out of puff.  the World cannot afford to keep it on according to the political-economic model on which it was built.  Something has to give, big time.Greg and Michael discuss some of the cracks appearing in the paradigm.  The zealots of the paradigm are beginning to thrash about madly.  Their simplistic old ways don't work so theymseek to make them even more unrealistically simple. We have a small window to think better than this.  Let's make good use of it.

10 Mar 2016 9:06:42amYears back in a small country town there was just one CES which being short staffed meant long queues.Now in the same town there are at least 7 employment providers- all with offices and company cars. Do these places provide better service than the old CES. There are no queues since you only go there if there is an appointment made.Do they provide jobs? I doubt it. The last 2 jobs I had were through proper commercial employment agencies- EBR and Hays. All that the numerous government funded employment agencies do seems to be about enforcement. Making one attend their office every few weeks. I have NEVER been sent a message that they have got me an interview or even a possible vacancy. I use SEEK to find my own to apply for.I cannot believe that this proliferation of job agencies is either cheaper or more effective- no matter how profitable they are
Alert moderator
10 Mar 2016 9:09:51amThe private employment agencies have been around long enough now for Australians to make a valid assessment of the scheme. The word useless immediately springs to mind. When a 50 something unemployed person (via redundancy) with a university education and 25+ years of work experience gets told that he/she should do a telephone marketing course I struggle to find a valid reason for the agency receiving tax payer funding. Don't even start me on the high staff turn over rate at these agencies. Every 2nd or 3rd time  somebody rolls up to a compulsory interview, the staff (invariably very young and inexperienced) they are dealing with have not done any preparation which in turn means they spend the entire meeting time going through the collection of information the agency already has. Once again, don't start me on the agency then claiming extra government funds by claiming that the agency had something to do with the job that the unemployed person got by their own endeavours.
Alert moderator
10 Mar 2016 10:27:07amCJ22, speak to anyone who goes through these private employment agencies and you soon get the feeling that with a lot of these agencies, unless they not for profit agencies, the purpose is more about the money they can make than about the job they can get for you.  There appears to be a lot of recycling through non-productive training courses, that they get paid for, all too often if resulting in a job that job is more often a short term tempory job.  In this system the people who make the money are the ones who own these employment agencies.  CES, may have had problems but they weren't getting paid for you being unemployed, or being restricted to the cycle of tempory employment, unemployment, tempory employment, unemployment.

10 Mar 2016 12:43:50pmCJ22, I fully concur with your observations and experiences. The gulf between the young consultant and the older, qualified, experienced worker is gigantic. Beyond frustrating, it's simply laughable.John 51, you are quite right. It's not hard to test. A private job agency has, by definition, ONE goal : to make a profit, else, it's not there.It's important to note this fine difference in definition: it is there to make a profit, not reduce unemployment. A private job agency cares not one whit about the social welfare bill, about the unemployment rate, about social disharmony, or even the state of the nation's economy.It's cares begin, and end, with it's own financial well-being.

Alert moderator
11 Mar 2016 3:35:04amThe level of private employment provider incompetence also extends to the younger unemployed people.In one instance, a young man had to cease a TAFE course because he had become legally blind and safe operation of machinery had become impossible. He was sent along to a nominated job search provider, where the sweet young thing asked him to choose areas where he would like employment from a list on a computer screen he could not see.When he did not respond, she asked him what he was interested in and he stated "Electronics." She then listed a couple of jobs for him to apply for: both were for a Licensed Electrician.In another instance, a young man was willing to have a go at anything suggested, as long as it paid something. He was sent off to a country location to help spray for fruit fly, then completed further certificates, at his own expense, in order to obtain more related work. When the task was finished a few weeks later he was dismissed from the job. After that came repeated 'traineeships' which always finished when the government subsidy to the employer ran out. His employment terminated, the employer started another 'trainee' the following week.The job provider receives payment each time an unemployed person is churned through the system, so it is a win for the employer, who only has to pay part of the wages, and a win for the job provider who gets paid for turnover of applicants.The only losers are the unemployed, who have their hopes raised only to repeatedly be slapped down again. Many become depressed, giving employment to the health professions. Some suicide when the feelings of being neglected and useless become overwhelming.Can we, as a community, afford the loss of so many of our young people onto the economic scrapheap?

10 Mar 2016 12:18:00pmThe function of private employment service providers is very largely to "shake the tree" and harass people off welfare and the unemployment statistics. Some people leave simply because the system is a nuisance and offers little or no benefit. Others leave because compulsory participation in activities interferes with their ability to engage in employment or business below the radar.The employment service providers make profits by ticking the right boxes. Much of their income is derived from claiming outcomes that are unrelated to their efforts. To this end spotters fees are commonly offered and employers are offered incentives to make placements fit into the requirements to be claimable as outcomes.Jobs can't be created in a vacuum and very often a claimable employment outcome is simply the result of a job being lost elsewhere; a rearrangement of the deck chairs.

10 Mar 2016 10:14:44amEven, I would take what you say an extra step.  The glaringly obvious object of neo-liberalism is how to use the power of wealth and position to avoid paying tax.  Privatising services of government has two objective outcomes.  It opens those privatised services to exploitation by those providing them for personal profit.  Its other objective through the policy of 'User Pays' is to reduce the arm of government and therefore personal and corporate tax rates.  What this privatising these services does open the door to is the potential of greater corruption.  This fact is what is not actually stated in this article yet it is so obvious that I find it strange that it is not.  Even within government provision of such services there is always the potential of corruption, but when privatised this potential for corruption is made so much greater and should be acknowledged loud and clear to all as we debate this issue.

10 Mar 2016 12:11:59pmAnother effect of downsizing government is those we elect to lead our nation effectively become less and less able to do so.Any utility you care to name, electricity, water, telephones, are all in the hands of private companies. These are things that should be a basic human right in a developed nation, but today "we, the people" are a secondary consideration to "them, the shareholders". The ability for government to influence things that used to be one of their main reason of existence (ie the delivery of services and infrastructure) is today negligable.As governments continue to downsize, the reason for their existence drops proportionaly. Today we elect debating club members, highly paid ones at that, not leaders.How big should government be? As big as it NEEDS to be.How should it be funded? We should be taxed fairly and raise enough to meet the ENTIRE spending needs

10 Mar 2016 12:10:15pmStructural unemployment of around 5% is not "lag" or even " adjustment" but actually the preferred MINIMUM of unemployment for businesses that like to keep labour costs capped. The 200-300k of immigrants aren't the problem. They create jobs and help grow the economy and some are children, etc, so aren't working/competing for jobs (although we should all question whether growth is ideal) and is more a distraction than reality. It also plays into the hands of the racists who like to blame "foreigners". Let's focus on the employers who deliberately fail invest in training and innovation because they're too lazy and stupid. Let's start thinking about doing more with less but getting more people to do more rather than using that as an excuse to cut jobs/costs. And let's all remember that we should be payig more tax but getting them spent better rather than giving up the ghost and wanting ever lower taxes. Those who are "all right, Jack" always benefit from lower taxes but we're all in the position of needing help at times and that's when we all cry out for more services that can't be funded by reduced taxation... Wakey, wakey...

10 Mar 2016 12:46:14pmI understand what you are saying, hated, but there's a massive flaw. The Neo-lib experiment has now been going for more than 4 decades here. TAFE has been gutted. Government services have been privatised. Dodgy diploma factories are rife. What does this mean?It means we aren't producing the skilled labour we need. Very few apprentices are going through TAFE anymore. State run electricity or railways for example used to produce fully skilled tradies, not any more. And dodgy diploma factories are producing 'graduates' with no skills to offer. This will take decades to rectify, and the system has been set up to fill the gap by bringing in foreign workers. We are in a situation where we can't just 'turn off' the immigration tap, until we start to, at the beginning, drip feed into the system our own skilled workers slowly turning that drip into a good steady flow.

10 Mar 2016 9:36:30amDog tags, it would depend entirely on whether, or not, the same services were being delivered.Always a moveable feast that comparison. Just like mobile phone services who vary their plans so nobody can really compare suppliers, it is so easy for the metrics to be altered enough to make real evaluation relevant.I do accept that public services can tend to be less than efficient, although I am also pretty certain that the same criticism can be leveled at most large entities. But one thing we do know for certain and that is the private system has a new input cost involved - profit.Every time a public service or utility is privatised it is done so with the argument that it will deliver efficiency, competition and better value and services - but the outcome is that this never happens. Efficiencies and rationalisations do occur and are directed towards profit, prices go up, services are trimmed and customers who don't represent good revenue are ignored or shunned.I cannot think of a single public business or service that has been improved (for the majority of people) by being sold.

I was not on benefits and supported myself entirely. Every day I was looking for work and applying for multiple times. It was targeted towards specific industries at first but towards I was partial to anything that paid. I enlisted with multiple employment agencies who would bring me in my nice suit and tie, have me complete a form, give me a small interview and then send me on my way after promising me they would do all they could to find suitable employment.Almost none of them came back to me and I've known multiple people who have had similar experiences The only two I would recommend who found me work in the interim and eventually a permanent position would be Robert Walters & Recruitment Edge who were quite good to me. The majority of them would say to me "oh we know a job that's perfect for you" and then I wouldn't receive any further contact. From my experience I'm of the opinion that the employment service market is over saturated and could do with regulation and possibly some pruning of the more useless agencies as well.

10 Mar 2016 12:59:02pmI had essentially the same experience as you Chubblo. Provider: this is our computer room. You have to come here twice a week and look for jobs on the network. Me: I have a computer and Internet access at home. Aren't the jobs on this network the exact same jobs I can access via the Internet at home?Provider: Centrelink requires you to look for work. Me: I am looking for work. Everyday. This week I've submitted 20 applications. Provider: you have to come here to do it. How else will we know if you are genuinely seeking work?Me: because I have to inform Centrelink every fortnight and provide evidence that I've been looking for work. Provider: *pause* if you don't come here, sign in and use these computers we will inform Centrelink you aren't meeting your commitments. So there I was. Using their computers. Signing in. I found a job myself, with no help from the provider, through my own resources and my internet connection at home. I have no idea how much the government paid these guys but they were less than useless. I had been a banker and manager for more than a decade and they wanted me to take typing courses, resume writing courses (despite one of their 'consultants' stating my resume was brilliant), as a seminar on how to present at interviews. What a rort.

10 Mar 2016 1:29:14pmThis article, and your post, miss the point entirely. I am definitely an advocate for smaller Government. And I would suggest to you that ANY taxpayer funds going into some "Employment Agency" is the OPPOSITE of what smaller Government advocates want. If you need employment "services" PAY FOR IT YOURSELF. Either directly, or by VOLUNTARILY, taking out some kind of income insurance policy that covers such unnecessary luxuries. People should be entitled to financial hel when unemployed, but that should simply be a cash payment - a cash payment that could be greater if such compulsory "services" were not covered.The problem that will never be absent from Government is that nobody cares about savings and, more importantly, nobody is rewarded for savings. Ditto for strong performance. The consequences of spending too much are that an uninformed and disinterested public collective are supposed to care. This will never be the same as private shareholders. If you make savings or work your backside off in a Government setting, you will find that everyone around you dislikes you. Because you are making their lives harder. In the private sector, this person would be able to be bonussed or promoted and would have the thanks of his/her employers, the shareholders. What thanks from the taxpayer? Zero.Government itself needs to be run more like a business. For example, Department staff should be given bonuses for making savings, and their numbers cut when massive deficits are run. In the private sector, if the company is bleeding money, layoffs happen. If the company is doing really well, bonuses happen. I know, I know, the Left think that no human being is motivated by self-interest and they all act completely altruistically. If that assumption held, I would not have a problem with collectivism and Big Government. However, I know I care more about myself and my family and friends than I do about others. I do not believe I am alone. The gap between rich and poor is ever widening. The party of Biggest Government (ALP/Greens) in the name of collectivism and social engineering make cigarettes artificially more expensive due to their own value judgements of how individuals lead their lives and manage their health. I look around poorer suburbs and still see high rates of smoking, but increased rates of social and financial desperation. If the ALP/Greens get back in they want $60 packs of ciggies. This is popular among the collective as only 10-15% of the population smoke. That is, the poor are in for unprecedented pain when Labor get back in. More than just being left alone to determine their own lives, the poor will be fleeced for being addicted to one of the most addictive substances known to man. Yes, poor people who do not smoke. You know, the neighbours, friends and family of someone under the weight of addiction and profiteering WILL suffer, no matter if they live just how the ALP/Greens dictate

10 Mar 2016 3:52:29pmGovernment being run like a business is all part of the narrative justifying the current model that you're opposing Todd. Unlike business, externalising people ends up with them committing crimes and to other outcomes that government simply can't wash its hands of in the way that business can.It's a bit like the business council constantly calling for lower wages. Lower (company) taxes. A budget surplus. WIthout having to deal with the actual macroeconomic and social consequences of these outcomes.And I'm not sure why you're singling out the ALP and the Greens for sin taxes. Abbott rose the smoking excise. There's vice crimes and sin taxes across the political spectrum.

10 Mar 2016 10:24:48amYou've got it wrong, dog Tags."At no cost to the taxpayer" usually means "At twice the cost to the citizenry, except that the money goes to a private company instead of providing services for the common good".Just look at all the toll roads in Sydney that are 'at no cost to the taxpayer', unless the taxpayer is someone who spends $4,000 per annum on tolls.  Try putting a $4,000 tax on using an expressway, and see how many votes it costs you!  But if you set things up so that the $4,000 in view goes to an investment bank instead, you can claim to be 'solving the transport problem, at no cost to the taxpayer!'What hooey!  Privatisation serves no-one except the investors!

10 Mar 2016 1:49:17pmPrivatisation is NOT small Government. Small Government is the removal of Government from the process. With roads, this is not possible, but for other areas, like "free" marriage counselling and so on, the free market should be left alone. Privatisation still has the same disinteretsed Goverment employees awarding the contracts - which means we pay too much. Ask any contractor about dealings with Government, they will confirm what I have said. Rudd's famous BER (Builders' Early Retirement) program serves as an excellent example. The constructions were provided by the private sector, but the contracts were awarded by the Government. So, that $2million contract to build something, could probably done for far less.

10 Mar 2016 10:30:20amIt is an excellent article but it does leave a number of questions like you noted. I am not sure the point of the article was to answer all questions, just to clarify what is happening and why.The other point I would like to make, that is not well addressed in this article is that while some services work better when privatised, for example, privatising the CBA was a very good decision bringing in additional competition products and services, most don't are just ideological money grabs by poor governments to make themselves look good.Howard paid off $90 billion deficit by selling $87 billion in assets. Including this $87 billion, his government had $250 billion in surpluses so there is no reason to sell these assets other than ideological. What would our accumulated returns from these $87 billion in assets have been over the 15-20 years since they were sold? What would their value be today? Our deficit today could be $150+ billion less simply from the returns from these assets.

10 Mar 2016 10:30:56amThis is also an important point and needs to be debated."Whether it saves taxpayer dollars or not"  - Mr Hockey used to repeat that there are "x" percentages of persons classified as rich but they pay "x + 150 - 300%" on a per person basis compared to the overall average.  Society is not just about money.  It is about getting a result per $1 spent if you just look at the economics.   Money spent without a result in purely economic terms is wasted money and my bet that privatizing the education sector means a great deal of money is wasted - running into billions.  Economics aside society is about caring, looking after those who cannot look after themselves - and yes there are heaps of them.  Of course personal responsibility is important but take the phrase "Love one another as you love yourself".  But what if you have no idea of love let alone loving yourself?  So one person can adhere to maxim whilst the other has a blank stare and could not care less about him/herself let alone others.  But that does not excuse looking the other way when it comes to homelessness which is sickeningly rife in our community for example.If society were just about money we would not have had the Harvester Judgement in the early 1900's, the minimum wage, overtime rates, superannuation for all, paid holidays etc.  And yet all of these are under attack by the defined neoliberalism (what a sick wrong word) because of globalization of the world's economies no matter what it costs to each society in question. America is in rebellion against the assumed status quo and the endless lies that have been peddled on such issues.  Australia will follow as it always does.

10 Mar 2016 1:08:38pm"In relative terms, is paying numerous private agencies and their contractors cheaper or more expensive than it was when it was run by the government?"Privatising a monopoly is never a recipe for efficiency. Some monopolies are not practical to eliminate (e.g. water and sewage) and should be publically run, with careful scrutiny but the owners (that's us folks).Others, like the taxpayer funded job seeking, can only be eliminated by changing the environment. A way to do this would be to eliminate the entire welfare bureaucracy by removing all welfare payments and having a single untested tax free 'basic wage' (say $20k) distributed to all tax file number holders by the ATO. It would have a lot of other beneficial side effects too.

10 Mar 2016 1:50:08pmThe article focuses on different types of ideologies. Therefore it is less concerned with practical realities. The answer to your question is: it depends.It depends on the type of market.If a market is properly competitive then the private sector can help drive down prices and increase diversity. For example, the software industry has lower barriers to entry and therefore benefits from great competition so much so that we actually have a lot of different software providers essentially supplying their product for free through apps etc.However if a market is uncompetitive then this is less likely. For example the energy sector has significant barriers to entry and therefore will be inherently uncompetitive meaning prices will be increased.There are also situations where you have captive demand like health services. When your life is at risk it doesn't put you in a very strong negotiating position to bargain on price (or to bargain with your private health insurer). The problem with the right v left dynamic and this nonsense about "neoliberalism" which is like some sort of buzz word since the GFC, is that they are gross generalisations as all ideologies need to be.Things are more nuanced than that. It's not all bad or not all good.Ideally government should approach these things by looking at what markets are efficient and what markets are inefficient. All steps need to be taken to ensure markets remain as competitive as possible (that means strong merger control). But some markets, because of the significant barriers to entry or because they are natural monopolies, are better off being controlled by government. The market will be inefficient whichever way you look at but the last thing we want is an inefficient market being controlled by a profit maximising private sector.There's also the classic postal service argument: why would a profit maximising private postal service deliver mail to the top of mountain? It wouldn't. So if you want the mail delivered to the top of the mountain then you need the public sector to do it, and if you want the public sector to afford to deliver mail to the top of the mountain then it should also deliver mail to the CBD so it can subsidise the non-profital parts.So in short, it's complicated.

In recent years service seems to be on the improve.Optus when it first began had a strong corporate philosophy of excellence in technology AND customer service. As the ownership changed this has been lost and the current owners see customer service and a robust network as impediments to profit taking.looking back at Telstra there were  hidden benefits that were never communicated to the general public. As one example the research labs in Melbourne contributed to many ultimately public projects that have benefited society. Someone noted in an earlier post the loss of such positives. The Neo Cons and their ilk do not want to see such benefits come to light lest they be seen as the true wreckers that they are.

In scrawled child-like writing it stated:"motem in soktet in wall"I was to infer from this cryptic message that while I was away a cosmic genius had been given access to my office, decided to use a hammer-drill into a plastered brick wall without any preparation or care about would happen to the debris and what damage it could cause. And had installed an extra phone line (which he presumed would be used for a modem that he wasn't supplying).Excellent service indeed.

Then he fixed it or so he said until two days later my neighbor  came around complaining that his garden was flooded.

10 Mar 2016 10:17:37amOwnership should be irrelevant, it's management that makes the difference and the transfer of a public monopoly (like Telstra) into private hands makes no sense and is definitely not in the best interests of the public.What Telstra used to fund internally (like improving mobiles coverage, cross-subsidising connection costs or even the maintenance of its own network) is now funded by the taxpayer. It is no longer a public utility but a money-making machine beholden only to its shareholders.Anybody like to give a single example of a privatisation that resulted in lower prices or improved services?

10 Mar 2016 12:24:23pmThe best example of how privatisation screwed us over is the green slips for car rego in NSW."They'll get cheaper" Mr Griener told us. Which they did.For about two weeks.In a single year the costs of the insurance on cars tripled. If you were unlucky enough to ride a motor bike at the time it went even higher.In those early days of privatised green slips the at-fault driver wasn't covered if they were injured either. It took a number of years before insurance companies started doing that.

This was at a time when my wage was only about $300 a week! One of my lasting memories at that time was seeing my car rego was worth more than I earnt!My Honda 400 Superhawk went from about $60 as the CTP to nearly $400. I never good get a good explanation why as the at-fault driver in those days wasn't covered, and if I was hurt by another road user THEIR CTP was covering me.Whenever I get a CTP bill today I say a little prayer to Mr Griener and the Gods of Free Enterprise.

10 Mar 2016 1:23:07pmFair go.If I remember right, the lawyers and judges ( yes, our legal friends again ) were handing out massive amounts of compensation for injuries sustained in motor vehicle accidents.

NSW was going under because of this alone.Interesting that there are now moves afoot to ( finally ) put a limit on some of these payouts.

It's only consumer law - that they are always trying to undermine - that provides a limitation on the worst behaviour.External market forces are not enough of a regulation when there is a duopoly that can afford to squeeze or damage suppliers and consumers, or the market is dominated by big players that effectually block competition. Essential services provide a somewhat captive market. Fees and charges for connections are not something that people can economise on. It's also problematic when in order for a consumer to challenge these mega-corporations there is not kind of real equality in access to legal representation. in the case of the job agencies we are seeing just how little accountabilitythese organisations have. If they actually had an obligation to the people forced to use them they market forces might have a role to play.

LGBT rights, multiculturalism, etc have all been on the rise.AT the same time, it is ABSOLUTELY true that on the Economic spectrum, both parties have been moving to the right. Everything is getting privatised, the rich get richer, the neoliberal dream gets realised.I'm a huge advocate for having 4 political parties in this country: Socially Left/Economically Left (Greens), Socially Right/Economically Left (Labor), Socially Left/Economically Right (Liberal Party), Socially Right/Economically Right (Conservative Party).Then you might actually see groups working together. The Conservatives might campaign with Labor against gay marriage. The Greens might work with the Liberals to campaign for it!
Alert moderator
10 Mar 2016 2:22:47pmNice analysis. However, social and economic are not mutually exclusive. For example, is Labor's $60 ciggies policy social or economic? They are certainly not proposing 1000-2000% taxation on any other products. Yet, such taxation will certainly widen the gap between rich and poor. And not just the extra $400 a week a smoker will have to find. The experience of poverty (not being able to afford rent, books, transport), also retards the natural development of poorer smokers. That is, the Government imposed poverty decreased an indivdual's chances of, say, attaining a tertiary education. Of course, the tiny proportion of smokers that are rich, will be entirely unaffected. And Labor call this a social (health) measure, but it will have vast, wide ranging impacts on the entire population of lower SES segments both socially AND economically. Basically, smokers will become the economic and social equivalant of Ice addicts. Family, friends and neighbours will bear the cost where the tobacco addict cannot afford to service his/her addiction. Violent crime will increase also in these lower SES areas as despoerate addicts without family and friends are forced to steal to maintain their habit. Oh, but that's right, the Left say "just give up". Yep, that works with all addictive substances to the same degree. Rarely. And the ALP/Greens damn well know that. Call it smart politics? Fine, as smokers are a minority. Call it ruthlessly opportunistic? Absolutely, just as any drug dealer knows, if you have an addictive product, there is almost no elasticity of demand and therefore one can charge whatever price they like. But I will never accept any notion that the poorest in our community are better off under Leftist policies. Indeed, it is those seeking to improve their lives, that require economic and social freedom the MOST.

10 Mar 2016 1:20:46pmYou say multiculturalism is a bad thing. You seem to forget that migrants of all stripes built this country. Come over to my house and tell my Chinese Australian sister in law, my Greek brother in law, my mixes raced children, my multicultural mix nephews that they are a blight on this nation. Here's a little tip before you come though. We are all Australian, we all speak like Australians, we all love out footy and support the socceroosc we are all law abiding and pay our taxes, and several of us provide the services this nation depends on, such as nursing, law enforcement and public works. Now about immigration. Immigration has soared BECAUSE OF Neo-liberalism. You see this endless need for growth at the lowest cost thing that is at the heart of Neo-liberalism CANNOT survive without an ever expanding, ever cheaper source of labour and consumers. Blame your beloved right or that. Welfare state? Doesn't exist. Employment must remain at about 5% or it pushed up inflation and puts upwards pressure on wages. Again, that is what Neo-liberalism demands. Governments that sticks it's nose in other peoples business huh? Try telling that to Abetz and Bernardi who are paranoidly and obsessively preoccupied with what people do in their bedrooms. It's interesting. It was Howard and then Abbott who have imposed the most draconian oversight of their own people. Metadata laws. Citizenship laws. The erosion of civil liberties. I genuinely am puzzled by your post.

10 Mar 2016 12:49:45pmRubbish. Read their policy and try and understand the effect the grandfathering clause will have. Better still, do some reading on how negative gearing actually works. It isn't a crime to inform yourself.Eventually no one will be able to negative gear against property UNLESS they build it new. It'll take a decade or two to wash through completely, but it will happen, and the shock to the economy Dutton is trying to scare people with won't be able to happen.It can even be argued it won't take even that long to wash through. As these investments mature the interest component on the loans drops. Anyone that takes an interest in how their home loan statements will tell you the longer they hold the loan the more of the payment goes to the principle and less to the interest component. What will happen in reality is as time wears on the existing investments will get to a point they can no longer be negative geared.Once the value of that interest component is lower than the rental your actually making money and you CAN'T negative gear unless your doing something dodgy.Attacks the salary earner? How? By putting the next generation of salary earners in a position where house prices are NOT continually being driven higher by investors? Odd way to attack, making the roof over the head affordable to anyone willing to work for it. Watching my daughter and her future husband house hunting now is a real education. Their budget is $650k and looking in the lower mountains. To date, and they have been looking well over 6 months, they haven't even been able to put an offer in on any thing they have looked at due to investors snapping them up, often without even looking at the properties if you can believe some of the stuff real estate agents are telling them.Oh, btw, they both earn reasonable amounts of money, and are both Labor voters.

Alert moderator
10 Mar 2016 4:18:06pmI've read the policy Harry. The difference being I understand how negative gearing works and what this proposal seeks to correct, which you clearly DO NOT. You clearly don't understand how loans work either.Or maybe you do and are just trying to confuse the situation? For argument sakes I'll assume you are as ignorant as your posts suggests.Even these existing investments can only be able to claim negative gearing IF they are making a loss.You may be making $12000 per year rental income. You have to actually be charged MORE than $12000 interest each month, or spend it on maintenance,  to calm any NG.That position will not continue for the full 25 or 30 years of a loan. In fact it only lasts for the first 5 to 10 years. Any variable mortgage will have payments going to both the principle and the interest, and the proportion of each depends on the size of the principle still remaining. It eventually gets to the point where the interest charges WILL fall below any income you earn.It's why there is so much "churn" in these investments. Once the loans reach the point they can't be negative geared the properties are then often sold for the capital gains, and the investor gets a second bite at the government purse thanks largely to the generous capital gains tax concession left to us by John Howard in 2000.Or are you actually suggesting Labor's changes will allow anyone currently negative gearing will still be allowed to continue buying more property to keep sucking money off the tax payer? I only ask because that would be funny, and I'd realize your posts are just trying to get a laugh.

The definition of negative gearing is that the investment income is loss making compared to its recurrent expenses.Now for some arithmetic genius:"You may be making $12000 per year rental income. You have to actually be charged MORE than $12000 interest each month, or spend it on maintenance, to calm any NG"Apparently you have to pay more than $144k a year against yearly income of $12k, who knew! By the way, how does one "calm[sic]" negative gearing?Excellent work!So you claim that people prefer to lose money so that they can get less than half of it back on tax, and that the moment they look remotely like making any money, they sell it. Is that how you think investment works?"Or are you actually suggesting Labor's changes will allow anyone currently negative gearing will still be allowed to continue buying more property to keep sucking money off the tax payer? I only ask because that would be funny, and I'd realize your posts are just trying to get a laugh."Actually that's exactly what their policy states:"From 1 July 2017 losses from new investments in shares and existing properties can still be used to offset investment income tax liabilities. These losses can also continue to be carried forward to offset the final capital gain on the investment."What part of "losses from NEW investments in shares and EXISTING properties" is too hard for you to comprehend?Their policy only hurts the small investor.

10 Mar 2016 1:29:03pmYou seem to believe that Labor aren't actually Neo-Libs, Harry, just not as much as the Coalition. Many economists and commentators actually agree with you, as do I. NG should be repealed completely, not grandfathered, though I do understand the politics behind the decision to allow grandfathering. The thing is though that even with grandfathering most investors won't be NGing existing properties a decade down the track. Quite frankly if your investment property isn't positively geared after a decade then you are deliberately trying to make a loss. I see no Eason why the taxpayer should fund that. Allowing NGing on new properties makes sense, though I do believe that there does not exist an under supply problem. Just in Sydney alone there are thousands of empty properties deliberately kept vacant for NGing purposes. Cutting the CGT should see the owners if these properties suddenly decide to put tenants in, as the risk of not getting enough CG to cover their losses on a reduced margin is too great.

"It often doesn't take that long spacey, unless they are doing something dodgy like spending money refurbishing their residential house and writing it off against their investment property. That NEVER happens does it???Both my father-in-law (a retired house painter), and my future son in law have never been asked to make an invoice out to another address. (If you believe that, you'll believe anything)At work we borrow large amounts of money for capital equipment often. Even these investments only can be negative geared for a short while as the loans are often only for 5 years or so. They quickly get to the point they can't be NG'd. The distinction between borrowing for plant and equipment compared to the existing property market lies here. These business investments actually help drive the economy and are very short lived. Speculation on existing properties does nothing to stimulate economic activity and can be exploited far too easily.
Alert moderator
10 Mar 2016 6:14:56pmOnce again you are thoroughly confused.Interest payments on capital equipment is a deductible expense against the income of the company. Presumably you won't buy expensive plant and equipment that doesn't earn enough to pay for its financing.The plant and equipment can be depreciated, dependent on the normal working life of the item. The depreciation charge is also deductible.This has nothing to do with negative gearing unless you routinely make poor decisions about large purchases, which given the multiple pieces of evidence showing you don't understand very much about tax law might be more likely than it should be.

10 Mar 2016 4:29:21pmSelective quoting out of context, hey Harry? Looks like you didn't read the FULL policy yourself, just the bit you seek to misrepresent. Here it is in full."Negative gearingLabor will limit negative gearing to new housing from 1 July 2017. All investments made before this date will not be affected by this change and will be fully grandfathered.This will mean that taxpayers will continue to be able to deduct net rental losses against their wage income, providing the losses come from newly constructed housing.From 1 July 2017 losses from new investments in shares and existing properties can still be used to offset investment income tax liabilities. These losses can also continue to be carried forward to offset the final capital gain on the investment.The key thing you want to gloss over is this "can still be used to offset investment income tax liabilities"INVESTMENT INCOME tax liabilities.

These losses can also continue to be carried forward to offset the final capital gain on the investment."ie. Not the grandfathered ones. New ones.Their only change stops deductions against salaries for new investments. So, as I clearly stated, their changes only affect those without other investments. The rich are totally unaffected since they will have plenty of investment income and can even carry forward losses to future years if they run out of investment income.So yes it is a big difference, but only to the Mums&Dads, first home buyers looking to rent the place out in the early years to afford the repayments and people making their first investment. It won't make a squat of difference to the rich. Is this how Labor is portraying it?

10 Mar 2016 1:46:47pmPartly agree. I think the biggest factor though is motivation. Setting up a new business is tough. So I don't really have a problem with the losses being set against future profits. But if a business is profitable the motivation behind setting up a related entity in such a away that the express purpose of the new entity is to lose money and offset those losses against the profits of the successful part of the business is plain wrong. In regards to shares and property I realky can't see any justification in allowing losses to be written off against income that is completely unrelated to the property. I believe that shared aren't such a big problem because many shares are bought with the threat of the bank making a margin call(something as a banker I hated having to do). If you have a property that is still ebony NG after a decade then you are deliberately trying to make a loss. No one should be subsidised to do that.

Alert moderator
10 Mar 2016 3:34:12pmI was a banker for more than a decade and the answer is of course they do. It's simple. The real problem is CGT, but NG makes the gamble of CT much less of a gamble. Let's say my interest is 15k. Incoming rent is 10-12k. Even after NG I'm losing 3-5k per annum. But I'm actually banking on the property increasing in value over the next 3-5 years and taking home the profit when I sell. This isn't 'investment', this is speculation. Now I can afford to lose that 3-5k for 3,4 or 5 years. It just means that the property better increase in value. But would I still invest in that property if I had to take the full 12k interest hit each year? If I'm a speculator the answer is no. The gamble that the properties value will increase enough in 3-5 years to cover those losses is too great. But if I'm a genuine investor then I will. Because I'm investing. Genuinely investing. After a decade or so that property will not only give me an asset, but genuine year on year income for as long as I hold on to it. So what this policy will do is remove the speculators from the market, leaving the genuine investors in while also allowing owner occupiers in to a more level playing field. You see genuine investors aren't gambling on a quick rise in property values propagated by speculators churning over property at short intervals. Genuine investors are looking for a real asset that creates positive revenue, year on year for as long as they hold it.

10 Mar 2016 4:23:21pm"But would I still invest in that property if I had to take the full 12k interest hit each year? "You seem confused, the "interest hit" is $15k in you example. Against this, in your example, rent is $10-12k", so the "hit"is between $5k and $3k.None of the confused example above says that the person deliberately sets out to lose money. They would always prefer that the rental income exceeded the interest payments. Being positively geared would make them even more money.All negative gearing does is reduce the size of the "hit" because of the loss of a large amount of disposable income will lead to a smaller tax refund.There are many genuine reasons why an investment goes negative, such as not being able to rent it for an extended period either because of no tenants or because of repairs following damage, such as through a storm. Labor's approach penalises salary earners but would allow negative gearing to be deducted against other investments. This unfairly advantages the genuinely rich, and yet all of the left-leaning commentary has claimed that it is "fairer", showing that they either have no idea what they are talking about or are totally partisan. With the left, it's usually both.

10 Mar 2016 8:42:58pmOf course it does Harry!You see if I own 3,4,5 or 10 investment properties, there is no reason whatsoever for me to take a loan out to pay for my next property. You see if I own 3,4,5 or 10 investments properties then the only way I'm losing money is if I'm doing it deliberately. Because after I've owned the first property for 3-4 years it should already be positively geared. The same goes for my second property etc etc through the cycle. To be losing money on your 3rd property, or your 10th, means you are delivers pry losing money. As I said Harry, I've been dealing with property investors for over a decade. Now, it is quite true that there are very good reasons why someone might lose money on their investment and claim a loss. But in each if your theoreticals the loss should only be temporary - a blip. There is no reason to be claiming a loss year on year on year.

Once you go past that and into actively assisting people despite their own failings, to ensure equal outcomes, you're overriding the innate talents and individual efforts for some false sense of "equality".

10 Mar 2016 10:49:19amI don't diagree, it's getting the balance right. I said I worked hard, the cleaners who  cleaned my office also worked hard, and many of them had none of the other advantages I had. I don't think the 'working hard' factor was the biggest one in our relative status. I'm not saying they should get paid the same as a surgeon or whatever, but they should get a 'fair' wage (once agin that's the hard part). I am a big fan of personal responsibility, but I disagree with the notion that 'working hard' is the biggest factor in people's success, it's an important one, but so are all the other things. I didn't have to work particularly hard at school, because I found the work easy, for example. Others had to work much harder for the same results.I believe we do have a responsibility to wider society, where 'lefties' would disagree I think we all do, even the poor. I have no problem with a requirement to do volunteer work to get the dole for example. But to say that's 'fair', but it's OK for the mega rich to avoid taxes because have 'earned' their wealth, I disagree with.

10 Mar 2016 11:58:39amwhogoesthere,I must clarify that I'm talking about relative success.That is, what is the outcome for people who have similar talents and work ethic to yourself. I would consider innate characteristics like intelligence or physical strength to be outside of this discussion. For example, I would consider the fact that people with different intelligence levels or innate attributes have different life outcomes is totally fair and is actually equality in action. It's not unfair that Tiger Woods gets paid millions of dollars for playing golf and I don't, even if we were spending the exact same effort on the game.And there's various levels of "working hard", which aren't about time or individual effort. A lot of it is about value. The main goal is to provide people with the system and tools to better their own situation if they want to.

11 Mar 2016 12:10:16pmyou had me right up until work for the dole....I also agree that we all owe something to our community - I'd like to see that emphasised a bit more. But work for the dole and the more punitive restrictions actually created quite a few problems.Firstly, charities and community agencies - like all employers - like to pick and choose their staff. Secondly, work for the dole is, quite bluntly, slave labour. Witness what is happening in the UK where large companies are substituting paid workers with unemployed doing forced labour. And in australia some of the salvos work for the dole programs looked exactly like that to me.  By all means provide work to people - but let it be within their capacities and let it be paid fairly. Even if its short term, and everyone has a go.Thirdly - you lost a lot of volunteers with the current bizarre job hunting requirements. Sole parents who ran canteens or worked as unpaid classroom help are now studying endless pointless course and going to endless pointless job interviews to make money for a private agencies instead.

Warren Buffet and Bill Gates have donated billions to charity- does that prove capitalism is wrong?Nearly every economy since the introduction of currency has had a mix of incentives for personal wealth generation balancing up against collectivised wealth capture for public spending. (Take a memo to the Nobel committee for that one). And so do we. If there were no restrains on personal wealth generation we'd have serfs and a nobility. If there were no restraints on collectivisation we'd all be queuing up for bread. Both have their pitfalls and their uses.Where is starts to unravel is when governments, at the behest of the wealthy, distort markets to collectivise not for the public, but for private interests. Every knows that they are. Truth is we're all capitalists and we're all socialists depending on what part of the economy we're talking about. If only we were more consistent

The TAFE privatisation-by-stealth fiasco in NSW is an excellent example of the down-side of privatisation.Many years ago, I did some teaching work for a mob called "Skillshare" - a Commonwealth initiative that formed part of the "Working Nation" programme. It was well-run, efficient and highly successful in giving long-term unemployed people the skills and confidence to find work, and sopme basic work skills in a number of industries. The success rate was high and the whole scheme was highly cost-effective.But then there was a change of government and the "Working Nation" programme was discontinued and the support services it had provided in such an efficient way were put out to tender.I got a bit more work with one of the successful tenderers and conducted a few courses for them. I withdrew gracefully when I was asked to falsify attendance records and fudge test results to meet the performance criteria.The private sector-based system that replaced Working Nation cost a fortune and was massively rorted.  Every subsequent employment training and support scheme has followed the same model (heavy private sector involvement) and has run into the same problems, with cost-blowouts, falling standards, manipulation of results and bare-faced corruption.But lots of Liberal Party donors have big fat government contracts, and that's all that matters I suppose.

In the old days the powerplay way between the King/Queen and the rest of the Aristocacy where one knew that their position and power and wealth depended on the support and interplay with the other.  Nowdays it has simply shifted to the powerplay between the government and the Capitalist system supported by all of its lobbyist.  Of course lobbyists are not a new thing seeing having your own powerful lobbyists were also part of the power crucial back in the days of the Aristocracy.  It seems no matter how much things change little really changes.  Do we really have democracy, or is it as I would suggest still very much a work in progress and therefore still vulnerable.The trouble is too many people think we have democracy and therefore we can forget about it, that it is no more than the need to simply go and tick a box once every three or four years at an election.

Hence a catastrophic drop in standards and skills - but who cares as 'products' are only fodder for the cannon of the rich the powerful and vested interests - no wonder Bernie Sanders has such massive support amongst the 'young' - under 35's as they have woken up to the truths of this article. (2) The workforce that was being shot to ribbons ruthlessly using such tools as 457 visa's and cheap labour from all over the place - for example a senior technical  executive in the shipping industry informed me that whereas persons such as he would be employed there is a massive switch using 457 visas to employing persons from countries such as India and I suppose he is prejudiced when he says "yes they are cheap but of very low skills and standards - claiming they can walk on water but drown hopelessly when situations arise - a disaster waiting to happen"  What he is yet to wake up being in his 50's that he is only a product - fodder.No wonder Mr Turnbull got nailed in Whyalla by a rather forceful citizen who votes.  And this is where the right has seriously miscalculated with the current trend lines indicating defeat for the Government or a situation created whereby they think although it is hard to get their way now being made totally impossible in the future.

10 Mar 2016 11:30:27amcat,"Since day 1 the NBN has been overtime and over budget."In fact, the reverse is true. Initial estimates of the cost of the NBN came in at around the $50 billion mark, but the project was on track to cost considerably less than this ($45 - $47 billion). And this is pretty cheap for the complete replacement of an entire national telecommunications network.So it is not true to say that the NBN was ever "over budget".But the same cannot be said for its replacement - the Turnbull Fraudband Notwork. Initial cost estimates were about $35 billion, but it is clear that the project will cost at least twice this amount, and we have just learned that they haven't even figured out how to make the final link in the "fibre to the node" model (the link to the customers premises).This is not surprising. It is almost always more expensive to "renoveate" than it is to build from scratch, and the results are rarely satisfactory.The big problem for the TFN model is the mishmash of media being used and the state of the existing network. It is pretty clear that the TFN planners massively underestimated the decrepitude of the existing PSTN, or faced irresistable pressure to ignore it. As a result, thousands of kilometers of new copper cable have been ordered, and the cost of purchasing and laying this cable was not invluded in the TFN estimates, and neither was the cost of buying out cable networks.In the end, we are unlikely to get much change out of $90 billion, and none of the fundamental reasons for replacing the PSTN will have been addressed. The network will still be as unreliable as it is now, and the maintenance bill can only get bigger. And then you have to factor in the cost of eventually finishing the job and retro-fitting fibre optic cables to replace the copper currently being installed.It was never just a matter of getting fast broadband. And that is where Turnbull made his big mistake.

10 Mar 2016 10:37:11amI'm just having a read down the comments, and thinking over the methodologies of the big and small government mentalities, and the common dilemma that seems to come to mind through a lot of the various sensible posts here so early in the day is something revolving about the dichotomy of monopoly versus competition.For example, a truly private electricity provider system would allow for half a dozen or more different electric companies to compete against each other on price and service provision, with enough different players to avoid collusion.One single privatised electric company to choose from is not really a proper private system, because ALL consumers are forced to use that one provider, so they basically have us all by the short and curlies, like a public electric company monopoly.  It is consumer choice which brings out the best in private enterprise, due to competition.With the CES vs. 'Yob' Network, that's not really a public vs. private equation either, because from the consumer's point of view, the so-called 'private' job network 'thing' still has the same power to punish its customers by reporting anything they feel like secretly back to centrelink, who are a public monopoly.  No competition, but only collusion and corruption.  Neither of these examples are truly 'private' because they are all based on a monopoly system.  That there are more than one job network services does not reduce the monopoly because each one is dependant on centrelink to source their victims, or they'd all have more time in their working days to sit around and drink coffee and twiddle their thumbs than they do now.

10 Mar 2016 11:52:54ambb,"For example, a truly private electricity provider system would allow for half a dozen or more different electric companies to compete against each other on price and service provision, with enough different players to avoid collusion."Nice theory, but it suffers from being too far removed from the reality that it is supposed to describe.The biggest cost involved in electricity provision is the distribution infrastructure, and we only need one transmission network. Can you just imagine how stupid it would be to have six sets of power cables running down every street?So, in order to create the illusion of competition, the privatisation happens at the distribution end and works by creating a whole heap of trading bureaus who produce no electricity but specialise in buying and selling.While this introduces a degree of competition, the competition is confined to a layer of the operation that was specifically created for the purpose and contributes nothing to the production and delivery of electricity.Electricity production and distribution is a good example of what is known as a "natural monopoly" in liberal-democratic theory. There is only a need for one electricity distribution grid. Adding extra grids would be patently absurd. And, according to liberal-democratic theory, it is vital that ALL natural monopolies (eg ports, education, roads, rail, defence, electricity production and distribution, healthcare etc) remain in public hands.If monopoly is inevitrable in a market, the choice is not between monopoly and competition, but between public monopoly and private monopoly. In such circumstances, public monopoly is the only rational choice.

10 Mar 2016 12:48:16pmThat is an excellent point v, and one I would have liked to have had the chance to explain a bit more earlier, but it wasn't quite necessary in the initial context, so thank you for bringing this conundrum to the discussion.Telcos are another example of a service which, if I can put this rightly, does not benefit the community by economies of scale, as such, if you can group that loose attachment back into what you have mentioned.  One big jet plane will carry more human cargo than many little ones, and one physical power network (using the Westinghouse AC model) is more efficient over the geographical layout of a city than a whole lot of competing organisations all laying their own networks, true.  True for electric, for gas, for telcos, because of the physical cost.Labour however, is another matter.  On both sides of the physical layer of a single electricity network, there are people: A - to build and maintain that network, and B - to sell it, connect it, meter it, support it, bill it, PR it.The network must be owned by the community, governed by the government.  However, the building and maintenance of the network can be done in house, by the government, or tendered to private contractors, who are accountable to the government for doing the job efficiently and with the required quality.Likewise, there can be any number of private companies who buy quotas of kWh from the central government agency acting on behalf of the 'community' and then onsell those kWh to consumers at the lowest prices, and or with the highest standards of service for sales, connection, administration and support.Whether it is better to let the government handle the entire system from building to customer service is debatable, but for the purposes of this topic, there needs to be a distinction between truly private free-market competition, and a monopoly masquerading under the label of privatisation simply because there are shareholders who comprise an exclusive section of wealthy community members, while the rest get ripped off by force.It can be done to a point, but it is obvious that the physical networks are best built by the community together, under the governance of an elected government.

10 Mar 2016 4:30:01pmIndeed, if it's done with understanding that there is not perfect knowledge nor perfect mobility, nor some other thing I can't remember from high school, but it's probably the easiest one to remember if you're scramming for an exam', knowing me.The good old days were easier because there were not so many of us munchkins all trying to live longer than each other so much, as a generalisation, but a breakdown of the various labour required to change a tyre is a good example, if you assume that the free market will, assuming perfect knowledge and perfect mobility, lead to perfect competition, where the itemisation of each specific task on the invoice allows the customer to hop on the magic loan carpet and zip around and get all the different chores done by the best-priced T-Mart.  Now, one thing to bear in mind in the power supplier equation is that labour has to come from somewhere, and no one who works for anyone: public or private, wants to be all that benevolent to strangers, even if they donate to the WWF and go to church on Sundays, but where the two differ, is that public concerns have a captive market due to monopoly, and consumers have no other choice at the retail end, nor does a government have anymuch choice at the supply end, because the most they can do is shunt someone off to the dept. of redeployment and hire another human risk to manage.On the other hand, if there are half a dozen private electricians tendering for the job, the government as the customer has the power to choose the one who will best serve the needs of the community.  Then on the retail side, if Coles and Woolies and IGA were all selling electricity, the customer could decide which one is the best for them, and so they will be required to compete for the business, unlike a public entity which everyone is forced to use.Do you see now how the greater choice provided by a true private system (not the pretend system that we have now for electricity companies who are monopolies with rich private shareholders) is far better than a public system where the cost of labour will be five times more, because nobody needs to try to compete with anyone else.  They have a captive market so they are not interested in competitive prices or decent service because there is nothing to motivate a public servant to do anything except out of the goodness of their heart, and that is not something I'd recommend you bet money on.

10 Mar 2016 7:14:49pmBen," the government as the customer has the power to choose the one who will best serve the needs of the community."Unfortunately, this is not what happens, because the government, as the customer, also has the power to choose the tenderer who offers the cheapest price. And this simple fact is one of the main contributing factors in the "skills shortage" that we are experiencing.You see, for people to acquire skills they need training, and training doesn't grow on trees. It costs quite a lot to train staff, and if you can eliminate those costs by getting someone else to pay for the training, you can then offer a cheaper tender.When our natural monopolies were in public hands and ran as instruments of government rather than "businesses", the large utilities trained their own staff. It was relatively easy to secure an apprenticeship or a cadetship because large public utilities provided training for their own purposes, and this provided a ready pool of highly skilled workers for other allied industries as well.Now, I suppose that the government could insist that all tenderers factor the cost of training into their bids, but this would defeat the main purpose of creating false competition in the first place - cost savings.As we are now realising (way too late), a skilled workforce is a very important "need of the community" that was being provided by large public utilities that have now been broken up and privatised.Large, vertically integrated public utilities are the most efficient and democratic way of providing, not just electricity or telecommunications services, but "collateral benefits" like a constant source of skilled labour. Break them up, and the benefits disappear, as well as the efficiencies.

It's only Thursday so I hope you checkin tomorrow if you're not still here this late (9pm on Mt, Warning, NSW).I don't agree with that statement in quotes.  For dogs to acquire skills, they need training.  For intelligent human beings to acquire knowledge, they need learning.Whatever way they choose to go about it, the same practical solutions are available to anyone who wants to learn something from either private or public companies - apprenticeships.  Besides, if someone wants to tender for a government job, then all they need to show is that they can do the job.  I don't want to pay for some apprentice tagging along if I need a new phoneline installed in my place.  All I want is one man who knows how to flick the big switch, because if he can't do the wiring then I'll do it myself.  If I need some information, I'll look it up on the web.  I don't like inefficiencies, because they balloon the entire economy and lead to cost-push inflation.Learning is what gets done at school, and if there was ever any truth in the 'skills-shortage' myth, then that comes back to too many stupidos who don't know how to learn something without being spoon-fed like babies.  It's all on the Internet.Economies of scale are a good thing for large jobs like citywide Wi-Fi, but let me assure you that a private servant will work a lot harder than a public one, simply because if the private servant doesn't do the job as well and as efficiently as he can, there's another bloke who needs a job and he'll be the one doing that job tomorrow, while Mr Lazybones goes on the dole.There is no such thing as getting the sack in the public service, and they all know it.  That is why the smaller the public service, the happier the public.

11 Mar 2016 8:42:25amben,"For intelligent human beings to acquire knowledge, they need learning."I couldn't agree more. Education which, as you point out, is different to training. They serve very different purposes.Education is a basic human need, but is also a fundamental human right. Education provides the key to 100,000 years of our shared cultural heritage. Nobody "owns" this heritage, and everybody "owns" it. Every human being who has ever been born has just as much right to access and enjoy our heritage, and this means that every human being has a fundamental right to the "keys" that give us that access.Education provides a particular type of learning that provides access to our shared cultural heritage, but it is not the only type of learning possible, and not the only type required by a civil society. Ever since the "division of labour" (and this pre-dates the emergence of Homo Sapiens) gave birth to the social phenomenon we call an "economy", training in specialised skills has been a fundamental requirement of civil society. It is a different thing to education, and it is probably fair to say that education is more important because it is not just a requirement but a right. But the simple fact is that we need both if we wish to maintain a stable and productive civil society.Unfortunately the distinction between education and training, which you so rightly point out, has been somewhat blurred over the past twenty or thirty years and I think that a big part of the problem can be traced back to the dismantling of our large, vertically integrated public utilities. In the absence of opportunities for training, the economic importance of skills training has overshadowed the civic and cultural importance of education, leading to the dilution of the educational value of degree and other academic courses.The only way of ensuring that we continue to reap the benefits of a well-educated AND highly skilled civil society is to allow both training and education to serve their respective primary purposes, and the best way to do this is to re-integrate training into workplaces and get it out of schools and universities.PS....I'm very, very jealous. Wish I was on top of Mt Warning........

11 Mar 2016 9:18:27amThat puts a better perspective on what I was trying to write about last night, v.  I have emotional reasons to cringe whenever I hear the word 'training' on the tele' because the first thing that comes to mind is Barbie Woodhouse standing on the green grass of some meadow in Dorchester with a troupe of attentive golden retrievers salivating down their chins.Emotional kneejerks aside, training for a specific job task is necessary in every job, even if it comes down to when to knock off and gather around the time clock at the end of the day.  We need to learn how each workplace operates in its own way, but this is important in any organisation of more than one.I still can't quite understand how anything public can do training any better than something private except that having no true profit motive, a cashed-up public organisation can throw more money at training than it has to, and rather than hire the best and most intelligent job candidates, a public company has to take whoever passes the public service test, if you can excuse a little exaggeration there.  This why employees of public corporations NEED more training.  Because they probably didn't do quite as well at school or grew up in single-parent families and lack the ordinary skills that more successful types already possess. including knowing how to learn new skills when needed.It is in the best interests of a private company that the staff are trained to do what they are responsible for, and if job hunters are prepared to compete with other qualified candidates on a global playing field, then they will have opportunities to gain employment in the private sector and receive the 'training' (sorry) required to fulfil such duties.I think that perhaps public companies seem to devote more money to workplace training, because: 1) they have more money to spend and no profit motive required to stay alive, and 2) they unfortunately have to hire less capable staff, because of all that equal opportunity rubbish that puts focus on who people are rather than what they can do.I must hit the shower and get ready for a big day out, and hope to be home sometime around 4.00 GMT.  I hope this discussion can continue towards a better understanding by the coming weekend.  Back later today.  Thanks.

10 Mar 2016 10:52:18amFrom my experience, when I was made redundant when the CES was running the show I got the help I needed and a job pretty quickly. The next time when it was run by a private business I received no help at all, numerous cancelled appointments (which I only found were cancelled when I turned up) but they were very quick to claim the money from the government when I found myself a job.

10 Mar 2016 10:03:46amThis is a common complaint about the privatised system. They are worse than useless. The old CES wasn't perfect, but we know it was better.A young lady gave up on them after five years, and soon got a job through a government service which caters for the disabled. She got her foot on the ladder and is climbing. Her new boss can't understand why she was ever unemployed.

10 Mar 2016 9:07:35amThe CES is a well-chosen example.  I worked for both the CES and  one of its private agency replacements and saw some shocking rots in the private sector.  When clients called to say they had a job and didn't need our help, staff were urged to get them in for some kind of interview so that the agency could claim their job as a result and get paid for it.  The government was billed for a photocipied handout given to 'clients' as if each notional hour it took them to get through some crappy worksheets in the handout was an hour spent with a caring employment counsellor.  More broadly, it seems obvious that some areas have no natural market.  The consumers don't have a clue how to choose, and so often don't, or choose against their own interests, while the mechanism of setting up the 'market' chews up an enormous amount of time and money, while enriching middlemen.

10 Mar 2016 10:29:34amExactly Floyd. I was short-term unemployed about 20 years ago and had to sign up for one of these agencies. When I found a new job off my own endeavours and notified them of this I was called in and presented with some forms one of which was an acknowledgement of the efficiency and hard work of that agency in finding employment for me.When I refused to fill out that form I was treated very badly and was told that it was a mandatory government form and had to be completed.I refused and heard nothing more about it as I suspected, it was just a box ticking exercise that went to raising the numbers for the agency in question.

10 Mar 2016 9:08:44amThis article is just 2 decades behind on the issue of globalisation and privatisation where sovereign nation-states are handing over control of resources and service to foreign countries and foreign corporations.  It is called Fascist Corporatism or Corporatism.  We can see how the treacherous political traitors have kept the TPP in their ultra secret negotiations from the Australian electorate.  That is one of the most undemocratic and abuse of process we have seen in Australia from the Parliament.Allowing trans-corporations to sue individual countries if the 'perceive' a competitive disadvantage is insane!  Regulations right across the board will be weakened  in many areas of health, economics, agriculture, safety and so in which they will dismantle the Medicare system and make it in their images which is number 37 in the world while Australia is number 6-7.  No democracy here by both sides of Parliament an no accountability or transparency as much touted from both sides.  We have traitors in Parliament who make decisions to weaken the national sovereign of individual countries.  It is a coup de tat from the corporations against democratic governments or what is left of the democracy process as it is a mere skeleton of what it should be.No Peoples referendum to decide the direction of this country.  Executive edicts that are not being checked by the other two tiers of government.

10 Mar 2016 9:12:51amTim Dunlop is quite delusional on this and obviously has no idea how the public service works which is not unsurprising as he actually works in a public service entity.What Tim has missed apart from pretty much everything, is that all these services that are supplied by the private sector such as health, education, employment, etc. are still overseen by public service organisations which means that they are still managed ineptly and waste can and does still occur on an industrial scale.My favourite example is the problems currently being encountered in the VET sector where huge sums of VET fee help have been spent on non-performing training courses.  Sure, it is bad, yet the dispense of VET fee help funds is entirely managed by the federal public service, who are responsible for the rules and regulations under which they are handed out.  In addition, all course work, delivery standards, and every single factor relating to training and assessment are under the control of ASQA which is again a federal government body completely staffed by public servants.Therefore, the problem is one of process, not one of who does it, and in the previous example it can be seen a lot of money is wasted, but it pales in comparison to what is wasted in TAFE's and other government managed training entities.  That is because they (public servants) don't tend to dob themselves in too often as they wish to preserve their perks and entitlements, and also they have a long history of knowing how to hide their dysfunction better than those in the private sector.Our main problem is that none of our political class has any worthwhile management skills, and yet they are often responsible for organisations which has tens of thousands of employees in them.  So, Tim 's big problem is that he is unable to see what he doesn't want to see, which is of course a common problem most frequently associated with those of the Left.

10 Mar 2016 10:42:36amCharles"Awareness - A problem most frequently associated with the left".But the migration of essential services from public entities to private entities is most frequently associated with the right.So the right's philosophy to give the control of important services to their mates so they can generate profits (as opposed to improving efficiency) is OK?The "lefts" inability to appreciate these huge strides in public benefit are the problem?The public service may be responsible for monitoring as you say but they do this in line with policy and legislation enacted by the government. Therefore what you are saying it is the fault of those administering a bad policy, not those who made the policy? Please clarify.

10 Mar 2016 10:58:42amCharles but is it you who is "unable to see what he doesn't want to see", like the slow destruction of TAFE and the proliferation of private "vocational training colleges" that have been exposed as scams as they get govt money just for signing up students with absolutely no completion requirement. The courses they provide are dangerously understaffed and give students useless qualifications.
Alert moderator
10 Mar 2016 1:49:57pmCharles, it's a pity you don't work in VET or the public service to know what you're talking about. Tertiary education in Australia has been absolutely gutted over the last 20-30 years, with the survivors being the so-called sandstone universities with old school tie connections with the politicians who have declared education (and health) a luxury for the well-off. The role of the public service is to deliver the services the minister asks for, even when that is patently against the national interest (as in education, health, trade). If you don't like it, you're supposed to vote for another politician, but they've all been bought, so what choice do we have? We need political reform that re-establishes the primacy of the national good. There's still plenty of scope for debate about what that is but the current system has systemic errors that reward self-interested behaviour.

Alert moderator
10 Mar 2016 10:34:28amI thought the ndis was the latest example of neoliberalism with a left-wing twist. My understanding was that eligible customers were given the ability to choose which private services they would pay for with their budget. Fleecing them, by overcharging, under servicing or just encouraging the client to choose lower priority services ahead of higher priority services, will be like taking candy from a baby. In fact when I think of the NDIS I imagine a school of sharks circling their cashed up victim. At the end of the day the critical difference between public and private is that private services must make a profit whilst public services must provide a service. The idea that private businesses will compete to provide the best service at the lowest price ignores concepts like "race to the bottom" and "snouts in the trough". Rorting the government is easy.

10 Mar 2016 9:17:48amThe author makes the same mistake that the groups he criticizes in this article do - taking an extreme position that ignores evidence that such position doesn't work (see the communist block and how well it did economically for evidence of that). Now to make it clear I'm not advocating neoliberalism - it's failings were at their most obvious in the GFC. A balanec between the two is required.Oh and the author also makes a whooper of an error in saying this:"The privatised employment agency became an agent of government control while the role of government changed from provision of welfare to one of surveillance."So the government no longer pays the dole then Tim? That would be the outcome if the conclusion above was correct. Now that isn't saying the government doesn't engage in surveillance in this area - of course it does. And most in the community are happy with that - after all the dole isn't like the pension. You get it as financial support to assist you to get back into the workforce, not simply because your unemployed and nothing more.

Of course there are overlaps but errors should be on the side of public utilities.Neo liberalism has gone too far, even affecting people in the Labor party who should have been relied upon to protect the interests of the majority.

10 Mar 2016 9:31:28amsmall government ?first law of bureaucracy- politicians make laws, they usually involves more coordinating management, which usually means more public servants and more government.this is the reality of cabinet government in western democracies dominated by lawyers ;) . now if we had cabinet government by engineers , the story might be different . perhaps the chinese polit bureau might have the answer there ;)second law of bureaucracy -  the exercise of political power is largely symbolic and arbitrary. policy is largely about what our political masters believe in, and not necessarily about what works, which means the party in power generally accumulates more losers the longer it stays in power, which means it eventually has to spend more and more money to placate the growing number of people that feel dis enfranchised from  its decisions making , which equals more government.  third law of bureaucracy - the regulators are regulated by the vested interests they are trying to regulate. a lot of money gets wasted on special interest pleading- and managing the process.  for instance the government debt market is the biggest case of corporate welfare known to mankind.fourth law of bureaucracy - the size of the government is a direct reflection , of the private sectors technical enginuity and the increased productive potential it creates . the government is a currency duoploist, and it has no choice but to issue enough currency into the system to finance the increased economic output of productivity gains.john howard got rid of 20,000 public servants, guess how many more he had by the time he lost office.we will never have small government, it will go the other way , and as joseph Schumpeter said , we will probably all end up being socialists in the end ;)

10 Mar 2016 10:03:05am"better links to employers"  actually they have very few, but I'm betting they've got plenty of links to politicians.  In fact every time there's a change of govt job seekers get pushed to another brand new Job Service Provider.  As a carer allowance receiver (42-45hrs per week but couldn't afford to survive on $116 a fortnight so had to also apply for Newstart) I was subjected to this merry-go-round more than once.  In fact one agencies came in that quick after an election thet didn't even have any computers, fortunately shortly after there was a change of govt the merry-go-round started again.  This is the great untapped money spinner with links to everything including the higher education money spinner.  Our policies are being written by them look at LNP's Social Security policy from ex Mission Employment agency big table sitter.  It's time the entire process was brought down & if Centrelink think they're the solution guess again they're just as useless. The majority of Australians at some time in their life will have encountered these & yet still they remain publi scrutiny free with even a former Labor Attorney General on a morning news show about 3.5 years back saying he had difficulty getting info from Centrelink.  That's not good enough.  We've had million + dollars accidently transferred to account in Brisbane move than one Centrelink employeee raiding the financial kitty.

We have seen that in action with the Howard govt's sale of Telstra's poles and wires and the subsequent NBN debacle, and soon we will see more of the same in NSW  with the sale of our electricity infrastructure to private interests in order to fund major road projects, just when we need govt to control that infrastructure to assist with the introduction of more renewable energy into the grid.  This small govt ideology also allows the system to be rorted by private political donors, as is occurring now with the slow destruction of TAFE and the proliferation of private "vocational training colleges". These colleges have mostly been exposed  as scams as they get govt money just for signing up students with absolutely no completion requirement, so the courses are dangerously understaffed and on completion they offer students useless qualifications.

10 Mar 2016 10:10:12amAny objective analysis of the capitalist system will show that as well as being incredibly productive, it is also incredibly disruptive and ruthless.  The capitalist system will eat itself unless restrained by the State, so the increasing influence of the neo-conservatives to reduce the role of the State is actually counter productive in the longer term.  The real concern is that the capitalist system is also eating the planet as seen by the continuing stupid comments about whether climate change is real or not.In addition, we the people are getting angrier and more frustrated with being ignored by our so called representatives.  The incredible success of Bernie Sanders in the US, (who ever would have thought we would see a serious Presidential nominee call himself a Democratic Socialist) and of the lunatic Trump on the far right are good examples of how the status quo is now under challenge.  The ongoing pressures on the state to assist the neo-conservatives is well demonstrated in NSW by the weasel actions of our Premier.  The introduction of laws to increase fines for the people who protest against CSG extraction have to be compared to the decrease in fines for mining companies that pollute!  Whose interests are being served here?  Again the Liberals want to privatise the profits and socialise the losses as Tim has pointed out, the current system can only survive with the active support and intervention of the Liberal Governments to create markets that don't exist by privatising our infrastructure and services so we end up paying for them twice.And they wonder why we do hate them so much!

Along comes a tribe of cancerous privateers and they set up to transfer large hunks of our nicely organised government systems to themselves for no money, or at a low cost. They would readily accept it as a gift.You'll note that they pick the smooth operating, well organised hunks of government industry to privatise. They're the ones which are already geared up with prime staff and ready to milk.The only thing that deters private industry is when the government unit is dissected for sale. Like Australia Post.It is well to note here that these government agencies are actually already in the hands of their original private owners, the people of Australia. We are forced to relinquish our share of the business for no money. That grieves me.

10 Mar 2016 10:23:04amA problem with a lot of these schemes is the private contractor, only wants to make money, and they will be mates of the Government anyway.   The quality of the product they are turning out (people for jobs), are only taught basic skills.   There still remains the problem, of someone getting good qualifications such as at TAFE or university or a trade apprentice, are the skilled and well trained people.   Employers wont hire someone who has been long term unemployed, they are too used to dodging the system, and causing problems at work, so they can be dismissed.   This might sound basic, it started in the Keating years, and ran under Howards Government until he pulled the pin on work for the dole.   Those people did three days a week, or they lost their social security payments if they did not attend and work.  And they cleaned up people's yards - mowed lawns for elderly people - and cleaned up the sides of roads where people throw rubbish.   To me, that scheme worked better, as it, took in people, and gave them basic work, the Government already had these people on social security, so there was their wages already paid.   The Government paid Aboriginal Corporations, who ran the scheme.   And a lot of times, that's all some people can handle, is a basic job, a few days a week. Anyone knows, most people coming from a Government employment agency,  as an employer, you are going to be checking on them a lot more then any other employee, as they will have problems, from social, to interpersonal, and be more prone to violence.   I have seen the current schemes in Western Queensland, you can tell the people who join these schemes, the ones who have worked get in and work, the ones who have not worked, just stand back and let others do it, and from that scenario, unless you knew the people personally, you would not employ them.    As well the training providers, show up,  give these guys a few lessons, in heavy transport driving, and assist them to get their driver's licence endorsed,  these people have done a course, but have no real hands on experience with machinery, driving such large vehicles under a lot of different conditions.  It is like the Security Guard industry,  it is just tick and flick, there is no care taken, to weed out the ones who are not suitable, everyone passes, no one fails these courses.  And the people running these scams just happen to be mates of the Government, they have never been in education before, and think because they know something, which has taken them years to work out which is experience, that they can pass it on in ten minutes, and give people the answers to the questions.   Government in this country, couldn't drive a nail into a wall.  There are no checks and balances, the people who assess the people being trained, should be independent assessors,  not the training provider.

10 Mar 2016 11:25:32am"Employers wont hire someone who has been long term unemployed".  The reality is they want to hire them they just don't want to pay them.  Even though wages have clearly failed to keep pace with the the cost of living they advertise jobs that are senior qualification jobs as junior positions so they can pay lower rates.  Then they play the traineeship, over 50 employee grant systems to the hilt.   Got a deficit LNP & Labor start lifting the ATO interest on loans to companies not paying their PAYG & Superan on time.It's time the Employers grant & tax lifelines were cut & they started paying their OWN Employee expenses.  It is utterly ridiculous that Employees taxes are paying part of their own wages (we've seen how much tax big business is paying).

10 Mar 2016 12:58:05pmYou can't confuse big business with small business.   I have seen small business where I am, not pay Superannuation installments.   Super payments should have to be declared the same as tax installments, by the employer, to make the process transparent and fair.   The other problem in rural and remote Regional Australia, is wages are much lower, then the rest of the country.   And this issue of tax should also be lower for people who live in these areas, as it does not affect many, people, but they pay more for food - groceries - everyday goods, (freight costs).   The main offenders here I have seen taking advantage of the Government are small business.   I seen some they will hire someone from a job agency, as they get 12 months subsidized wages, they get rid of them at the end of twelve months, and get some more on the same scheme, so they don't have to pay full wages. The Government,  wont enforce Super installments payments by employers, which affects what people have in Superannuation to retire on.   And then it falls back on Government, to put these people on the social security when they retire as their employer did not pay super installments.    Government is hoping if they give an incentive, that will offset the skills shortage, the employee has, and the employer will train their staff and keep them.   It is a scam by some small business people, who talk to their accountant, and work out they can get the government to subsidize the wages they pay.   With workplace training, the government is conned, into believing,  training will get people into jobs.   They need independent assessors, to see the employers are training their staff, and the staff are meeting their education standards and industry standards, by testing them.   Government would be better off, to cut incentives for employers, cut the personal tax rate, so that people can see if they work, they will have more money, in their pocket, then trying to live on social security.   The problem is, Government gets conned by small business and gets taken to the cleaner, when they do not enforce standards, or  do full audits on employers from training to tax to super installments.   If Scott Morrison wants tov talk about budget savings, instead of cutting things, he should go and take a hard look at small business social welfare.    The rip-offs in the system, goes across the whole range, from wages - training - employers - super installments.    The training scheme at the moment is the biggest scam, in a couple of days you can teach someone what the wheel nuts on a truck look like, it is another thing, to understand machinery, look after it, and see that it is maintained, and the operator has the experience to operate it under difficult conditions.

10 Mar 2016 10:31:19amInteresting article but to my way of thinking it misses the central point.The quality of legal outcomes depends very much on the funding available. This means that in a legal battle an individual is at a vast disadvantage against a company or corporation.In order for companies and corporations to be held legally accountable there must exist an organisation that advocates for the public interest and is sufficiently well-funded to compete not just with any one corporation but with many of them simultaneously in widely diverse fields of interest, each requiring specialised knowledge and detailed expertise.Our logic brings us inevitably to the existence of a large, well-funded federal government.

10 Mar 2016 10:33:12amDoes not matter whether left or right, small right government or socialist government, the one thing they all have in common is that they are the font of taxpayer funds.  One way or another everyone sees a pile of money under the control of disengaged public servants and politicians who are ill equipped to administer such large piles of money and who have no direct belief or responsibility to administer funds wisely and judiciously.We trust that politicians genuinely believe what they say and that what they say is accurate.  The business lobby says that there are too many people living off the public teat while dipping into those same government funds in the name of creating jobs and running things more efficiently than government.Well, the longer I live the less convinced I am that more than fifty per cent of business runs more efficiently than government organisations.  Just recently we have seen this phenomenon in action in Townsville with a private company owned either directly or indirectly by a Federal politician which has hit hard times and dismissed a large percentage of it's workforce and calling in Administrators.  First port of call was the Queensland State government to attempt to secure taxpayer funds to prop up a family owned business in the name of saving jobs.  When the state government considered the issue and drew up a list of conditions if it were to guarantee a loan, the quasi owner then suddenly found a bit of loose change(around $ 20M) to do the job.  There is no doubt the company which had been a profitable enterprise until the price of nickel dropped is in trouble not the least reason being it's funding of said politician's foray into politics.The waste of space individual whose only physical exercise is getting down to Centrelink now and then to lodge forms or whatever is no better or worse than many businesses who establish shonky business operations funded mostly by the taxpayer with no perceivable benefit to anyone but themselves.

10 Mar 2016 1:35:23pmHi Regionalgranny.  Depressing indeed.The one bright spot today came from reading Mr Shorten's remark on Tony Windsor's comeback:  "There are two people running in New England one is a respected politician and the other is the deputy PM," he said.

10 Mar 2016 4:37:00pmMr Windsor is trying to gain the seat of New England and I have a great deal of respect for him as an individual and as a politician.  He obviously has the interests of the electorate at the forefront of his thinking.  I fear that the years of the hung parliament would have taken a toll on him personally and there is no doubt that the party machine will go after him to discredit him.The Deputy PM may have a bit to think about in the next few weeks or months, not the least being why, when the National Party previously disendorsed Mr Windsor, the voters seemed to support him anyway.  It may bring home to the party machines and the factions therein, that the people who have the last word are the voters ie the people who live in the electorates and put politicians into Parliament to represent them.

10 Mar 2016 10:57:23amThere is an even more sinister outcome than those examples the author explains and  it is about the control of information.  the state cannot possibly possess enough information to second-guess market signals (prices) and because powerful interest groups will inevitably distort and bias state interventions (particularly in democracies) for their own benefit. This statement partly explains the devastating affect that neo cons have on government, they actively work to control the information available to ministers and  the people, government is a business opportunity that can actually umpire itself. This can reach in any direction including creating new meanings for words. This "neoliberal" term has no real relevance to liberalism, it is a radical group more closely aligned to the operations of fascism. The separation of government from business interests has been corrupted by both parties, The Labor party would probably like to put the plug back in but can't without the help of the Australian version of what it was to be Liberal or conservative, a strong  and healthy public service capable of instructing ministers with impartial advise. Our politicians are trained by business to be dancing bears, original thought and instincts  not required just do what you are told.

10 Mar 2016 11:14:16amDefine neoliberalism and then define the programs you believe are implemented in the name of your definition of neoliberalism and presto, a ready made argument to damn anyone to the right of Bernie Sanders.  However, privatisation is not an end in itself but one part of a process designed to achieve an efficient market.Unfortunately, most governments, including those which most who comment on these pages brand as "neoliberal" are left of centre and never bother to move towards an efficient market.  Why, because they do not really believe in the market mechanism.  In fact, let us assume for a moment that politicians enter their vocation from the best of intentions, the very fact that they believe governments can solve problems should provide a hint that they lean left rather than right.  The converse is that those who believe that government is the problem rather than solution are much less likely to pursue such a career.Yes that means Tony Abbott is not a "neoliberal", he cannot even be described as leaning to the right on anything other than national security issues.  On all conceivable social matters, Abbott was a conservative.  On all economic matters, Abbott leaned to the left, and if you doubt this, just look at the size of the budget deficit and his "signature" PPL program.  If anything, Tony Abbott was a neoconservative, not a "neoliberal".  Indeed, most if not all of those branded as "neoliberals" are in fact neoconservatives.  They may pursue a neoliberal idea here and there but do not be fooled into believing that this is anything other than for lip service.  They do not really embrace the notion of an efficient market.So back to the notion of privatisation and "neoliberalism".  An efficient market is the aim of the right, not privatisation.  When privatisation occurs in conjunction with a regulated monopoly or oligopoly, or where this involves contracting out of government services to a privatised firm, then an efficient market is hardly likely to evolve.Thus it is fair to criticize governments which pursue half-hearted market based reforms, whether these are based upon privatisation or not.  However, it should be remembered that this is not a criticism of the right, but a criticism of the left, for anyone who truly believes in the role of efficient markets in maximising social welfare would never pursue the examples cited on this page.

10 Mar 2016 12:47:45pmRay: a large part of the confusion is using political terms derived from overseas and then trying to overlay them on local politics. This sort of works in that strategies and indeed often players are from overseas. I'm confused  because I do identify with the notion of an efficient market, monitored by a healthy and well managed public service, which I expect to lead the way in many areas of progress precisely because of its potential to not be corrupted by market forces. This to my mind makes me a Liberal,  clean information provided to ministers, and a conservative in this information is considered carefully and discussed without bias  or bias identified openly and taken with less vigour.There are many areas that are better handled by publicly owned institutions and until corporate practice is  redesigned I don't see that changing.  I agree with your interpretation of Aus neo cons as opposed to neo liberal.  Tony Abbott  showed very little except the worst more stereo typical version of a conservative, an elitist boys club, no scientific or clear headed analysis there.I disagree that most governments are left of centre, I don't think political terminology travels well.

10 Mar 2016 11:37:02pmThe problem with privatisation is that you are taking an efficient service and selling it to someone for whom efficiency is secondary to profit. Health care, to take an obvious example, is most cost-efficient when it is managed as a long-term solution and with the economies of scale achievable by consolidation. Breaking it down, as the Liberals have done, into a variety of private insurance covers with a variety of products, drives costs up. And as the Liberals push this into even GP visits, it gets worse. It's not so different with other services and utilities. The competition they tout doesn't hold up over time because the players are too few to create an actually efficient market, and the consumers are left holding the bag, with no one in a position to pull back, to add weight to the power of oversight. When we sell off the public assets that give balance to markets, we give up the power we have as a society to ensure they are fair.But Liberals hate unions, too, because anything that gives equal power to anybody but their corporate masters has to be wrong, even conceptually.

10 Mar 2016 11:48:01amOf course, what's truly amusing is the delusion that humans have been genetically conditioned to accept, that there is such a thing as "private" vs "government"!!It matters not when it comes down to the ultimate enforcement of 'power'!!Everything else is mere obfuscation!  Smoke and mirrors designed to sucker the gullible into endorsing one particular power brokerage, whilst mindlessly opposing another power brokerage's version of a false reality.Both versions merely tussle for dominance - and they don't particularly care whether the 'plebs' actually believe their rhetoric or not; as long as enough of the other 'players' do, they know they can continue to manipulate events for their own advantage... which is unsurprisingly what the whole game is ultimately about!We're human versions of ants, being manipulated by members of our own species - not for the benefit of the species as a whole; but for the benefit of the individuals who see themselves as worthy of being "Queen", with all the workers acting on their behalf, because as they are born and bred to rule, the species will inevitably be better off simply because they're in charge... so, the rule of "anything goes" is warranted to ensure that they get what they're after.A simple proof of my contention is to just ask oneself "who is the ultimate power that actually can confiscate anything and everything that they might want or need?"If the answer is "the Government", then it's pretty clear that it matters not whether that Government is one that's there for the people, elected by the people, or one that's called a business, that's doing what it's doing in the name of helping the people.In the end it's just other people treating other people as they see fit.

10 Mar 2016 11:52:43amThe idea of having a lot of small enterprises competing against one another is very good in theory, but in practice the more powerful ones buy out or force out the small players & we then end up with huge cartels, like the banks, the oil companies & supermarkets that then set the price according to what they want & not what the consumer wants, so competition ceases to exist.Some of these companies get so big, that they earn the title of too big to fail, but of course they do fail & then the tax payer is forced into recuing them or else there is the threat of total disruption.Our current system is in total disarray & there does not seem any Govt. that is prepared to do anything about it, which then leads to the question of who is actually running the country & at present it sure aint the elected Govt.

10 Mar 2016 12:15:08pm"Our current system is in total disarray"...Or so it seems because it's patently clear there is no longer a sense of pride in the nation or in the endeavour of doing things for "our nation".In essence the morale of the country is at or nearing rock bottom and our political 'leaders' haven't got the foggiest about how to lift morale - regardless of whether it be morale in private industry or in the public service.They're too busy chasing their own tails for a start anyway.Given the global loss of morale - i.e. the rosy Hollywood promoted future of a world co-operatively heading towards a glowing future where we could meet intelligent beings from other peace loving worlds, has been replaced with pessimism and a sense of "what's the point?" amongst those who realise they've got fat chance of being 'recognised' regardless of the effort they put in for year upon year.The pendulum sure ain't gonna swing back in a hurry; that's for sure, but it'd be nice to think Australia could give it a go at getting the pendulum swinging back the other way...

Expenditure on the public health system has not kept up with the demand for health services.  When such expenditure has been increased it has come from the sale of land currently part of the public hospital system thus denying future expansion possibilities.

10 Mar 2016 12:27:30pmThe stated reason for moving govt services to the private sector is "that the private sector can do it More efficiently" This does not stand any rational analysis. "efficient" in this context means "cheaper" or "at less cost to the taxpayer"  The unstated assumption is that the public sector does not have the ability to be efficient. It is a true statement that some govt departments are inefficient in delivering their processes.  One need only to look at the traditional "council worker" to see situations where the system became so entrenched that reform and efficiency was in capable of being achieved without the use of massive political capital.  Another example is the union control and "jobs for life" in the Telecom workforce of telecom prior to privatisation. That being said.  A private company, in the govt services space,  (except for some charities which do welfare services) exists for the purpose of making profits.  Unless a company is making 15% on its capital and expenditure it is ineffective and the money is better in the bank. (don't get me wrong - I am a capitalist profit it good if it is generated in productive industry) Therefore a private company performing Govt work necessary has 15% of its income not going to Govt services but to profits. is necessarily 15% inefficient. As the function of a private company is to make profits - the more profits the better.  The primary way of increasing profits  in a corporate situation is to reduce costs.  I a company Costs include - provision of timely service,  wages, maintenance, stock and inventory.  Reducing any of these will increase the profit. Reducing any of these reduces the govt services. Therefore when a Govt services is privatised 1. necessarily there is a 15% cost inefficiency built in2. the corporate imperative means that services, maintenance and investment will be reduced - one need only look at the way Telstra performed after privatisation and before any competition came into the market. (note; the greatest beneficiaries of the privatisation of telecom was the taxpayers of Singapore who largely own Optus through Singtel)3. when those govt services are reduced there is no way of forcing the to improve. A complaint to you local member that (Telstra for example) is not providing a proper services will be met by the reply - its a private company. To my mind any natural monopoly - Electricity, roads, telecommunications infrastructure, ports, rail,; public safety infrastructure eg lighthouses;  and civil security - prisons, police, ambulance, army etc should be publicly owned.

10 Mar 2016 2:41:34pmThe thing many people are missing is that all interactions in society, apart from coercive ones, need people to have a set of attitudes and values that support and motivate the behaviour of the participants. These attitudes are partly instinctive, partly tacitly learned (in the family and other relationships that engage the emotions and the thinking of the learner in a way that imbeds them) and partly learned through a deliberate teaching/training process. Privatisation shifts the emphasis away from intrinsic, emotionally imbedded motivations, learned mainly in personal relationships, friendships, family etc.to extrinsic, instrumental relationships, which are much more fragile. The continued extension of the state, and the large private organisations it sponsors, destroys the deeply imbedded motivational structure that underpin honesty, fairness and caring for others. Not a surprise that we see a drift away from communal involvement, loyalty and public spiritedness towards a potentially more violent and extremist set of ideas and practices.The neoliberal agenda not only subverts democracy but. over time, it subverts itself.

10 Mar 2016 2:53:33pmAdd ...... the handing over of regulation to the 'regulated' as self-regulation and the persisting dependence on self regulation with its obvious failures (they would would never do anything to harm their own businesses would they?).... persisting to appeal to organizations to voluntarily choose to behave responsibly and ethically, rather than regulate, when it clearly puts those that do the right thing at a competitive disadvantage.... presumptions that private enterprise is always more efficient (not forgetting that many private educational institutions have degraded the value of qualifications and scammed the vulnerable).... the increasing acceptance of spin, spin, spin; being lies by the deliberate omission of relevant truths but not treated as lies; including obvious stonewalling by not answering legitimate questions.  Yes, government should not be larger that it needs to be and tax should not be higher than it needs to be.  However, the need should be meet a democratic agenda not a vested interest such as identified as neoliberalism, which seems to have no regard for the detrimental impacts of their ability to exercise demanded freedoms on others.Does it actually serve small business well and not just big business?  Running a business must be hard work but the solution is not simple.    Are not some corporations so large that they can play governments off against each other and governments need to cooperate to combat their power (countries unionize? how dare I?).  The unions had problems but so does business and the Royal Commission into unions was clearly one sidedly, politically motivated (CommInsure being the latest example on the other side)."The argument isn't about big government versus small government, but who government serves, the many or the few."  I know what Dunlop means but to reinforce the point let be point it more accurately.  The argument for smaller government probably serves as a proxy for having to explain details while serving the purpose of governing for the few.It does not mean everyone running business are bad people.  Just like the budget the problem is structural and driven by competition.  Even the best do not know all the answers but who do we trust?

10 Mar 2016 3:01:03pmWow... Good question: How to abolish a government?  But before we answer the first question, answer the second question first, which is:What are our plans after the government is abolished?Which leads us to the third question:Why did we contemplate the first question in the first place?In my dreaming, that's the sequence of events ... as outlined above.

10 Mar 2016 3:16:00pmOn one hand Tim is correct in that the argument involves the question of who does government serve, but he incorrect in asserting that it between the many or the few. Large government is an institution that makes the people serve it. Small government is a mechanism where the people are able to control how much the government controls it. The bigger the government the more we lose our individual freedoms. The smaller the government the greater our personal responsibilities start to kick in. This is the central difference between large government and small government. Small government means implicitly that individuals need to be self governed. It relies upon the fact that as a society we are evolving or developing towards maturity. Big government prevents this maturation process - because it implicitly says that unless we develop at the same time at the same pace then we will stay where we are. Where we are is in the hands of the state as their servants.

10 Mar 2016 3:21:55pmTim, it is my understanding that many organisations are now starting to abuse the system & not giving the unemployed a chance to be employed. Jobs that were once 'paying positions' are now being offered as volunteer positions. Time for the Government put an end to this.

10 Mar 2016 4:05:13pm'The power of financial capitalism had another far reaching aim, nothing less than to create a system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalistic fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences. The apex of the system was the Bank of International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the world's central banks which were themselves private corporations. The growth of financial capitalism made possible a centralisation of power for the direct benefit of financiers and the indirect injury of all other economic groups'  Extract from Tragedy and Hope by Professor Carroll Quigley.With ever increasing global debt driving economies -with more and more of us being caught in a debt trap; with falling household incomes and rising inequality can anyone really dispute the above?Take this country of ours- it is in a mess We run an economic growth based on a housing boom which is based on the need for increasing debt. Crazy stuff!!'Democracy is when the indigent and not the men of property are the rulers' Aristotle.

10 Mar 2016 5:42:15pmAs I understand it, small government and the privatisation of the rest of the government is primarily concerned with making a commodity of the environment and of people simply so that business can make a profit off the peoples back or off the environment.In our country, we now have the working poor who are unable to earn enough from sometimes 3 jobs to keep their heads above water.  Then we have the LNP seeking to cut the weekend penalty rates.  Lets face it the only people working on the weekends are those in the less skilled jobs...those who have to sacrifice their families to earn a wage to keep a roof over their head.Conversely we have parliamentarians who get 5 or so tax payer funded flights for their families because they don't get to spend enough time with their families. No thought to the people who have to work every weekend which is the only time their kids aren't at school. The statistics show us that the gap between the rich and poor is increasing.  In some countries we have a decreasing middle income bracket and all of this I believe can be laid at the hands of neo-liberalism and the drive to privatise government.It seems to me we have no agreed definition of government and what that government is to do.  What we do have is every time the conservative front an election especially when they have been in opposition is their comments about trimming the public sector.This is hidden talk for privatising the functions of government. The neo-liberals then talk of 'getting rid of red tape' but guess what...the red tape is the stuff that provides safe guards both people and the environment to stop exploitation.  So remove the red tape remove the protection.Did we ever look back at the legislation aka red tape that was removed and determine if that was a safe guard and if we are worse off?  No it seems we just accept the rhetoric and accept the promulgated view that public servants are lazy and shouldn't be fed.Then we complain we had to be on the line for a length of time or that the public servant couldn't do what you wanted...we then blame this person when the reality is they are hamstrung.Public servants can only do what the government tells them not what we the public need.I say go ahead and vote in leo-liberals at our peril!

10 Mar 2016 6:28:58pmGovernments at all levels make vicious laws that affect ordinary people, it's no wonder people want smaller government, here are some examples, a small goods butcher was prosercuted for putting  too much lean meat in his sausages, this was done by a vindictive government agency using a technicality, Then there was the NSW state government getting a small farmer kicked off his property for selling eggs to the public, then there was a case not long ago where were a man was prosecuted for defending his family against an aggressive and extremely venomous snake. To top it all you would think that an old man could have a couple of chickens on his property and be left in peace not with the council that administered his locality, one counciller did what she could to hound this old man from keeping his chooks, council inspectors were sent to his property on a regular basis to spy on him, and other officials carried on like standoverover merchants in an attempt to frighten the old man into relinquishing his fowls, the old man stood firm and with help from friends and well wishes made the decent councillors see sense and the council campaign against him ceased. If government made decent laws to deal with the nonsense that the banks and financial sectors carry on with people may have respect for governments at all level, as it is the possibility of replacing politicians with robots and computers should be looked at.
