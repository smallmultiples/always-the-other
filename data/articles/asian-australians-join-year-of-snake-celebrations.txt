Kelly Cao and Eric Fan will be revisiting long-held traditions as they celebrate Chinese New Year with their family in Australia.They will give their children, eight-year-old Yanan and one-year-old Lily, red envelopes filled with money to bring good luck and prosperity.The envelopes are a cherished memory from their own childhoods in China, where they would celebrate the start of the lunar year with extended family and friends.Their celebrations required weeks of preparation for banquets of duck, seafood and chicken dishes, dumplings and Asian vegetables and fruits.If they were lucky, children would receive many red envelopes."Red means lucky, also rich - a lot of meaning," Kelly Cao said."Before the Chinese New Year we prepare a lot of new clothes; everyone must have new clothes and buy a lot of food because a lot of shops are closed."You visit your friends and your family members and you say hello to them, give them best wishes for the next year and have a meal and a drink with them."The lunar new year is being celebrated this weekend, heralding the arrival of the Year of the Snake.More familiar with the Australian traditions of Christmas and Easter, young Yanan and Lily will have a chance to learn more about their Chinese heritage. They will join with some other Chinese-Australian families for the festivities."When I was one we moved to Adelaide, I didn't know China, I didn't even know what it looks like," Yanan said."This year we will celebrate Chinese New Year, we will get red envelopes, with money inside!"Kelly and Eric, whose Chinese names are Fuqing and Zhongcui, made the tough decision to move to Australia in 2006, when Yanan was just a toddler.They lived in Adelaide for three years, doing mainly manual work. Language difficulties prevented them from working in administration and communications, as they had done in China."When I first came to Australia I just did a cleaning job and I thought 'This is terrible', but it wasn't. As long as you're working hard, people will respect you," Kelly Cao said.In 2009 the family moved to Berri in the South Australian Riverland to operate a takeaway store.The birth of their second daughter Lily last year cemented their decision to raise a family in Australia.For Eric Fan, living in Australia has brought opportunities he had always wanted for his children."It's a big country, a big space and the freedom is good for them. They have a bright new future, a much brighter future than me," he said."It's freedom, I think the freedom, you work and don't worry too much outside of work."His wife agreed Australia now felt like home."We have nothing to go back to China, we love it here," she said.
