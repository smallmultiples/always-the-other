If you walk down the street in the north-western Sydney suburb of Ryde, chances are you'll catch the sound of a Chinese dialect drifting through the air.The area has one of the country's largest Chinese-Australian communities, and over the weekend some of its more creative members showcased their talents in an exhibition celebrating the successful blending of two distinct cultures.The Love My Home, Love My Community exhibition, organised by a local Chinese community group, brought together a diverse collection of cross-cultural paintings, photos and performances.Among the works displayed were traditional Chinese watercolours of Australian landscapes as well as eastern-style portraits of prominent Australians, including musician John Farnham and Indigenous activist Charles Perkins.The exhibition was part of efforts to give new and not-so-new Chinese migrants a stage to express themselves."I think the main challenge for new migrants is for them to feel like they belong to this community and to be accepted," said organiser Shiping Luo, from the Australian Chinese Cultural Education Activity Centre."In China people have a very rich cultural life, but when they come here, they lack language skills, they lack friends, so they often feel isolated and unsure of how to participate."One of the artists, 70-year-old CunDe Wang, migrated to Australia 20 years ago with a well-established background in painting.His bold, colourful works range from contemporary portraits of Australian children in rugby league jerseys to classical Chinese scenes."I was very familiar with Chinese art, so when I came to Australia, the new environment here provided me with lots of new opportunities to study and learn," he said through a translator.Another artist, Sydney-based Yongquan Cong, has been taking photos for 40 years with a specific focus on multiculturalism."I like to use my photos to demonstrate cultural harmony," he said."But I wish I was more involved myself in the mainstream of Australian society."The jovial 74-year-old migrated from China nine years ago, and though he insists he was one of the best students in his English class, he said the language barrier "continues to be a real challenge"."I would like to study more at TAFE, but I have no idea how to enrol," he laughed.Much of north-west Sydney's growing Chinese population fits within the federal electorate of Bennelong, which Maxine McKew won in 2007 - partly on the back of strong support from the Chinese community.She describes the area as a "multicultural melting pot" where fifth-generation Anglo-Australians mix with more recently settled residents, not just from a Chinese background, but also Indian and Sri Lankan as well."The great melting pot that is Australia is quite a force, so I think we've got a lot to be proud of," she said.As the federal member, Ms McKew says from time to time members of the local community raise concerns with her about the broader Australian-Chinese relationship, which has recently been strained over the detention of Australian Rio Tinto executive Stern Hu, and the visit to Australia by Uighur activist Rebiya Kadeer."But most families and most individuals in Bennelong just get on with their lives and focus on the day to day issues," she said.Ms Luo agrees that culture, not politics, is the focus for her community group when it comes to encouraging new migrants to express themselves.But she does single out one politician for the impact his Mandarin ability has had on Chinese-Australians."Since Kevin Rudd became the Prime Minister, our community feels more proud," she said.
