The case of detained Rio Tinto executive Stern Hu isn't the only problem facing Chinese-Australian relations.China's Communist Government has been accused of trying to stop a film about a Uighur activist premiering at the Melbourne International Film Festival.The film is about Rebiya Kadeer, who went from successful businesswoman to political prisoner and then leader in exile of the ethnic Uighur.The Uighurs are a largely Muslim and Turkic-based people who live in far western China.China has accused Ms Kadeer of instigating the ethnic riots which killed more than 180 people in Xinjiang province this month.Melbourne filmmaker Jeff Daniels has been working on the documentary The 10 Conditions Of Love for several years. It's finished just in time for the Melbourne International Film Festival (MIFF), and - just as the conflict central to the story - is making worldwide headlines.Richard Moore is the executive director of MIFF, where the film is due to premier next month."On Friday I received a call from Ms Chen, who is based here in Melbourne at the Chinese consulate," he said."She told me that she was ringing to urge me to withdraw the particular film Ten Conditions Of Love from the festival."I said I had no reason to withdraw the film from the festival and she then proceeded to tell me that I had to justify my decision to include the film in the festival."I said 'Well, I'm very sorry but I didn't have any reason to justify the inclusion of the film in the festival.' So she then proceeded to ... list Rebiya Kadeer's crimes. I have to say to you after about five minutes I blanked out."He says the essence of Ms Chen's arguments was that "Rebiya Kadeer was a criminal."Ms Kadeer is also due to speak at the festival next month. Mr Moore says the Chinese consulate urged him to cancel the visit."She was also very unhappy that Rebiya Kadeer is coming here as a guest," he said."It wasn't threats ... she was just continually insistent that the film should not be included in the festival."She plainly wasn't happy [the festival will continue as planned] and as I said before, she just went on to list Rebiya Kadeer's crimes and unfortunately I had to tell her that I could no longer continue the conversation because I'd already expressed my opinion, so I politely hung up."Mr Daniels concedes that the film could be considered biased."Well it's presenting a particular point of view and it presents a point of view that is very, very close to Rebiya Kadeer," he said."So I guess the Uighurs would say that from their perspective it's not biased."Attempts to contact the Chinese consulate for a response have proved unsuccessful.
