What protesters in Kiev see as a movement for freedom and prosperity looks to Moscow like a hybrid US/German empire reaching into the Russian sphere of influence, writes Matt Fitzpatrick.In 1783, Catherine the Great annexed the Crimean peninsula to Russia and established a naval base at Sevastopol. Thereafter, it became the seat of the Russian Black Sea fleet, which has clung on to this warm water naval outpost ever since, give or take some short term occupations by the Western victors of the Crimean war in the mid-nineteenth century and the Nazis during World War II.Russia's current deployment of troops to buttress the pro-Russian elements of the population in Crimea looks like blatant Russian aggression. There is some truth to this. Russia has repeatedly signed agreements with Ukraine guaranteeing its territorial integrity. In the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, Russia explicitly pledged not to use force against Ukraine except in self-defence. So too Article 3 of the 1997 Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership between the Russian Federation and Ukraine explicitly stated that both would observe the territorial integrity and inviolability of the borders of the other.Since then, however, Russia, and in particular Putin, have repeatedly pointed out in international fora that Russia views a pliant Ukraine as a necessary condition for Russian security. As the world saw with Georgia in 2008, Russia is happy for independent states to exist on its doorstep, but these states must not join the Western security pact aimed at Russia: NATO.Given their 1994 and 1997 assurances, Russia appears to have broken its obligations to Ukraine in international law. They may seek to exploit the wriggle room afforded by Point 6 of the Budapest memorandum, which offers a startling escape clause. Contrary to reporting in today's Daily Mail in Britain, the Budapest Memorandum does not oblige the UK and the US to intervene to forcibly throw the Russians back. Point 6 of the treaty simply states "Ukraine, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom ... and the United States of America will consult in the event a situation arises that raises a question concerning these commitments." Both Barack Obama and David Cameron have held long telephone discussions with Vladimir Putin since the recent crisis began, so consultation might be said to have occurred (after a fashion).From the Russian perspective, Article 1 of the 1997 Treaty also insisted upon the "strategic partnership and cooperation" of Russia and Ukraine. While this is far from an ironclad commitment to join any formal Russian-led enterprise (such as Putin's recently mooted Eurasian Union), it does suggest a tacit understanding by the Ukrainians of Russian interests in the region. This is to say nothing of the naval base agreements for the Crimea. For the Russians, Ukraine's NATO aspirations clearly jeopardise this commitment to a strategic partnership.A broader view of Russia's strategic position is also worth keeping in mind. Since the end of the Cold War, NATO has determinedly pinned Russia back further and further to the east, with its Cold War satellite states in Central Europe now all under the NATO umbrella, to the extent that it is Latvia and Lithuania who have called NATO together to discuss the present crisis. What prior to 1989 was called "containment of the Soviet menace" has since been an incremental push to deny Russia any influence in its immediate region. Not content with peeling off ex-Soviet territories, NATO and the EU have denuded Russia of all its remaining buffer states. All that remain are Ukraine and Georgia.In geostrategic terms, Russia is not interested in having either the German-dominated EU or US-controlled NATO directly outside its borders and it is willing to overstep the bounds of national sovereignty to ensure this doesn't happen. This is not new imperial thinking. Having had to fight for its existence against Germany twice in the first half of the twentieth century, the Soviets hung on grimly to a raft of buffer states in Eastern Europe for almost half a century. For the first time since the Wehrmacht was turned around at Stalingrad, Russia faces real frontier friction with the borderlands of an expanding EU and NATO. What for the protesters in Kiev is a vehicle for freedom, liberty and prosperity looks to Moscow like a hybrid US/German empire reaching into the Russian sphere of influence and towards the Russian border.US and European plans to push the EU towards Ukraine via 'associational' status look like a provocation to Putin. Even worse from the Russian perspective were the moves towards Ukraine joining NATO, which were managed in 2010 by the installation of a pro-Russian president in Yanukovych. In lieu of any diplomatic or political option for preserving its centuries long primacy over Ukraine, Russia will fight to defend its position in the Crimea against further NATO or EU encroachments.  Initially, the Crimea was key to Tsarist Russia's attempts to subdue the Ottoman Empire and expand its south-western territorial holdings towards the Mediterranean. During the Soviet era, particularly after WWII, the Black Sea fleet was a southern bulwark against NATO. In the post-Cold War era, it has served as a staging post for Russian military actions in the region, most notably in the 2008 war against Georgia. The Russians now rent the site from the Ukrainians, with their current lease lasting until 2042. As one Russian admiral said a couple of years ago, however, Russia intends to be there forever.Russia's current invasion of Crimea is aimed not at expanding and creating a new Russian Empire, but rather at preserving the last remnants of the last one. Although there is the chance that the Crimea will be incrementally absorbed if a political agreement with the new political leadership in Kiev cannot be found, the adage in Moscow presently is "informal empire when possible, formal imperialism when necessary". Like in the 2008 conflict with Georgia, Russia is seeking to preserve a threadbare system of peripheral states that has been placed under enormous stress in the past 25 years from an expanding European Union and NATO. Even if they agree to allow a rump Ukraine under revolutionary Kiev to move westward, the price will be Crimea.Matt Fitzpatrick is Associate Professor in International History at Flinders University.

Having chosen this course they have PUT themselves in opposition to everything Europe stands for.   A significant proportion of Ukraine wants closer ties to Europe then Russia and when you see what Putin stands for you can understand why this is so.

Mind you the Ukrainians have every right to be angry with Russia, past history as shown Russian genocide against the Ukrainians 'The Holodomor'  under Stalin, and Putin is very much in the mould of Stalin - leadership by personality, he only understands strength, being the ex-head of the KGB he understands all to well 'state sponsored repression'.  What the West needs to do is isolate Russia diplomatically, and financially  - back to the future - bring back Ronald Reagan

04 Mar 2014 4:41:22pmAbsoutely, FoS.They know the West will DO nothing. They will write strongly worded letters, send diplomats here, there and everywhere, but in the end they will not use a military option. That would not have been so bad pre-Snowden as the West could always bluff that they could use force. Snowden's 1.7m documents, I am sure, show the true state of play and US/UK intentions when it comes to the use of military options. This knowledge has emboldened Putin to a dangerous level. He will annex Crimea. The West will then do nothing but antagonise economically and diplomatically.The only rational "battle" for Russia to have with the West is now a military one as he knows the West has not the willingness to challenge him on that battlefield. First Syria, now Ukraine. Is it just me or does this seem eerily like what happened in Europe in the 30's? Hopefully, we can nip this in the bud, so we do not experience what Europe experienced in the 40's.I don't hold much hope under a Democratic White House though. Although I prefer the Democrats to Republicans on balance, World security is in jeopardy under weak Democratic leadership. I understand diplomacy seems more rational, hence Obama's position, but sometimes there is only one language that gets results. And it seems like the next President will have no remaining options other than military options.

05 Mar 2014 5:06:51amWealth is zero sum. The more public funds are siphoned off to create private palaces, the less public funds there are.Power is also zero sum. The more the parliament/senate is limited, the more power the PM has. The more laws there are that curtail government criticism, the less power the people have. The more corruption there is in the police ranks and in the courts, the less recourse commoners have to a "just" result.Just because someone was voted in doesn't make them immune to that. They can't create money from nothing without devaluing the money that already exists, and when they seek to increase their power and decrease the ability of others to disagree with them, well that calls for sterner stuff. And that's what the protesters brought to the table.Of course, the people who are holding onto political power until elections aren't necessarily the government that was voted in, they're the "Okay, number 1 is down. Now where's number 2 to keep everything together". Normally we'd call this impeachment, but when the ability of the various houses is limited and the person in charge instead calls in the army to maintain control?Well that's when things like Euromaidan happen. Of course, the situation is being manipulated by every power seeking nutter on the planet. But being voted in does not make someone immune to being kicked out when they focus on their own advancement at the expense of the country they're supposed to be guiding. And when other countries, say, Russia, step in and broadcast propaganda (You know it took official Ukrainian news sources and Russian sources two months to acknowledge beatings of journalists by police? And even then the police mention was only a line at the end of the article) then you've got a problem because the person in charge is no longer the elected representative but someone maneuvering for a dictatorship. And you know how those work, better to nip one in the bud than let it flower, so to speak.

04 Mar 2014 10:15:24am"And that gives Russia the right to invade the Ukraine?"Perhaps so. If the opposition mobs don't recognise the legitimacy of the government, why should any of it's neighbours recognise the legitimacy of the mob?
Alert moderator
05 Mar 2014 5:46:38am@ZingOh come on, the government lost legitimacy when they siphoned off billions in public funds for their own personal advancement and made moves to limit both the power of the parliament, and the ability to criticise the government. At that point you're no longer represented by someone you voted in, you're witness to the establishment of a new dictatorship. And when the government is dismissed by parliament but then orders in military to maintain their position? Well Churchill said it well, victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory however long and hard the road may be; for without victory, there is no survival.If someone tries to become a dictator, by force when they feel it necessary, they lose all legitimacy they may have gained from being elected.And no-one else gets to invade based on the actions of the people without tactically supporting the dictatorship. That's why Russia should recognise the legitimacy of "the mob", because it's recognise that the people have the right to remove faux dictators or dismiss the idea that the people have any say at all thereby removing the election legitimacy in the first place.Which is kind of obvious, isn't it? USA presidents have been impeached, British kings have been toppled, Russia is the only place where being voted in once apparently means permanent invincibility. Which in Russia itself makes sense, they have a habit of power hungry crazies coming to power and then devolve into civil war. Ukraine didn't need to do that. Which is probably the saddest part of all this, they accomplished a removal of a dictator with less than 200 deaths on all sides and now they'll lose independence to a surrounding empire. Again.

The facts are that the legally elected President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych had written and asked Russia to send troops to Ukraine to protect the people from a Germany backed coup where radical extremists have taken control of Kiev and some other parts of Ukraine. This is his legal right under the Constitution of Ukraine. As such Russia has acted 100% within all laws in Ukraine and the United Nations.

05 Mar 2014 1:45:52am@General Disarray. The Ukraine Presidential election takes two stages. In the first stage all candidates (of which there were several) compete. The candidates who receive the highest two votes going to the final second stage to decide the Presidency. Yanukovych won both the first round of voting and the second round. In the final vote, Yanukovych won the runoff election with 48.95% of the vote compared with 45.47% for Tymoshenko. The election was recognized and endorsed as being fair and an accurate reflection of voters' intentions by ALL international agencies observing the election including the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. It should also be noted that recent opinion polls (most by western media) over the last six months all showed that over 70% of the people would vote for Yanukovych in an election.

I've been to both Ukraine and Estonia, and the citizens of both certainly have strong reasons, both historical and current, for preferring the relatively free air of the West over the stifling authoritarianism of Russia.

04 Mar 2014 5:57:51pmWe did get a vote and it carried. Yet we were not "allowed" to secede as we are worth too much money and we do not control the military. For all the talk, it ALWAYS ends up boiling down to those with the guns (or the will to use them) call the shots.Putin calls the shots right now. I think the poor old Ukrainians would now vote in favour of Russia - and by a mile. Russia have shown how they roll - military action. The West have shown (yet again) that they can talk the leg off a chair and condemn Russian action until the cows come home. For the average non-suicidal Ukrainian, the decision is now a no-brainer. On one side you have Russia prepared to use force, on the other, discussions and meaningless words on paper to protect themselves with. So if Ukraine votes against Russian occupation, Russia moves in and the West does nothing. Then what becomes of those foolish enough to side with the Western friendly government? Hmmm. Whereas, if Ukraine votes for Russian occupation, the West will talk and condemn, but do nothing. Either way, I cannot make a rational case for anything other than Russian occupation.Same for WA, no matter what the will of the people, those with the guns (in this case, Canberra) call the shots. The sad part for Western (US & UK) taxpayers is that they DO waste trillions on guns, but elect leaders so weak they are still bullied by the likes of Putin. Even the Conservative British leader is weak. He does not even deserve to be in the same group as Thatcher. The benefit of a strong leader like Thatcher is that Putin would not even be doing this. He knows Obama and Cameron don't have a set of stones between them. Maggie had bigger stones than both of those men put together. She will go down as the last GREAT Western leader. That much is certain. I am truly glad that she did not live to see her British Bulldog become a Russian poodle (and that is under the Tories...Milliband will strap on a diamante collar for Putin and sit in his wife's handbag).

04 Mar 2014 7:14:24pmYes, the article appears to focus entirely on the Russian perceptions. Not in defence of a one-sided approach, I accept that it pays to have an insight into the motivations of the invader. It also pays to recognize that during the Soviet era, Ukraine - and especially the region of Crimea - had undergone substantial ethnic cleansing and artificial installation of ethnic Russians. Their descendants are the ones today who want to merge with Russia.Russia is (still) a member of the G8, safe and secure and had no reason to provoke a potential worldwide conflict. But their dangerous gamble is likely to succeed in annexing Crimea.The West will huff and puff, but the reality is that they haven't a leg to stand on after the invasion of Iraq, Afghanistan.Geopolitics sucks and has no place in enlightened societies, a state that most can't even comprehend, or at best associate with loopies seeking Utopia.Are earthlings destined to perpetual conflict and recurring misery in the name of commercial, or military aspirations with forever turning tables? Could we go back to the drawing board, please?

04 Mar 2014 9:17:38amThere's certainly many Ukranians that would like to be closer to Europe, possibly becuase they're sick of Russia, possibly because they fancy a plasma tv. Most of the Ukranian politicians went against the idea, largely at the IMF requirements that they privatise public assets, farming land and take out some hefty loans to "restructure" their economy. This would have done nothing for the established commerical classes who are wedded to the Russian economy, but have done wonders for those hoping to be enriched by a Europen union. Instead the politicians, in the main, went for the tens of billions of bonds purchases offered, and then begun by Russia. Probably no coincidence that the unrest began after the first tranche and no surprise who helped fund the unrest. The EU are in this for the money. The USA are in this to weaken Russia. The Russians are in it for what they see as their strategic security. Reckon that makes them more motivated. In the same way the US would never allow Mexico to join another block, the Russians won't allow Ukraine to go, short of the Americans threatening war. And they won't.

If they had no nuclear weapons no one would take any notice of them. Pompous windbags!
Alert moderator
04 Mar 2014 12:43:30pmKilling 100 protestors is a crime under domestic law, if the killing is proven unlawful. Even if the killing was unlawful, it wouldn't be a crime against humanity. This is because the force was not targeted at civilians generally, but at an organised group of rioters attempting to take over the country.If Yanukovych is charged, he'll be prosecuted by a Ukrainian court. They wouldn't want to take him to the Hague. It's likely they'd acquit him and rule that the takeover was unlawful (which would just be embarrassing).

04 Mar 2014 11:23:49amAditionally- the 'legitimacy' of the Russian position is based upon contrived demographics- the Crimean Tartars have been the unwanted beneficiary of forced movement and exile for over 150 years. If successive purges/forced relocations/ wholesale slaughter were not to have taken place, would there really be a 58% Russian majority in Crimea? But how far do you turn the clock back? I mean, those historical Russians might have been less inclined to carve up the local population if the Tartars hadn't been famous for relocating hordes of Russians themselves- as slaves. See? The Tartars did it to themselves!

04 Mar 2014 1:03:41pmAs you pontificate over Russia. Yank, the hypocrisy and ignorance of the US and UK position as enunciated by you is clearly evident. Before 'annexation' in 1783 the Crimea was  a part of the Ottoman Empire under Turkish domination. The Turks used the Crimea to stage centuries of invading wars against Russia, a fact not lost on them. You may know that Kiev was the centrepoint of Russian culture. Ukrainians share a common linguistic and cultural heritage in much the same way as Australians and New Zealanders, Canadians and North Americans, but going back millenia, not just centuries. Through centuries of history the Ukrainians have looked to Russia when under attack, and Russia has always responded. The Crimea has been part of the Russian nation for as long as the USA and Australia have existed as nations. You may not know that in 1954 it was the Ukrainian Soviet leader - Nikita Khrushchev - who dictatorially ceded Crimea to Ukraine. Unsurprisingly there was no 'democratic' vote taken from the Russian people nor were they consulted then about their wishes on whether they were agreeable to a valuable chunk of their nation being hived off.When the dissolution of the Soviet Union occurred, what hubris and arrogance the 'West' showed by using the inebriate Yeltsin's weakness of rule during one of his drunken stupors in 1994 to enter the Russian sphere of influence by negotiating the lease of Crimea 'back' to its former nation as if this was native Ukrainian territory. It never has been - apart from a dictatorial edict - and this is the huge mistake into which the keyboard warrior pundits of the West now fall into. A real act of friendship to Russia?  Can you imagine the outcry if Russia saw its role to broker the 'lease' of New Mexico back to Mexico from the USA? Except Russia has more historical and cultural legitimacy over Crimea than the US has in that particular case. Even the most 'western' Ukrainian ideologue knows Crimea is traditionally Russian territory and why mainly Russians live there.Then we look at your commentary in relation to the actions of those great bastions of freedom the USA and UK; truly their gob-smacking hypocrisy and 'holier than thou' attitude is vomit inducing: where was the UN backing for the USA and UK to invade the sovereign nation of Iraq ? Wasn't that an illegal invasion that was catastrophic to that nation? What was legal about Kennedy's invasion of the Bay of Pigs? How about the concocted invasion of Vietnam? Is the current 'interim' Ukrainian Government democratically elected by a majority of the people? If not, what legitimacy does this 'government' have to undertake the action they have and why is the West supporting an unelected, undemocratic government? This 'government' said it would "display its new cabinet to the crowd for its approval" - sounds more like the approval of the mob, not the nation to me! Is that what the US and UK stand for?

04 Mar 2014 1:33:51pmSo, to summarise, when America or Britain invade foreign countries, it's wrong;  when Russia does it, on the most specious of grounds, it's fine and dandy.By the way, Crimea was part of the Ukrainian SSR back in the 1950s, and remained part of Ukraine by mutual consent after independence.  To argue that the Russians had any right to the Black Sea ports in 1994 is to ignore that little reality.  Of course they had to lease back those ports - they didn't belong to Russia.

04 Mar 2014 11:14:53amThey didn't prefer it before but now they do. As millions live under the poverty line. Our relative has been a nurse for 20 years. She makes about 100,000 net a month. Out of that nearly 70,000 goes on utilities (so they don't turn off the heating or electricity). That doesn't leave you with much left, plus you have to eat as well. How about the hundreds of thousands who receive as little as 30 dollars a month. When we left Hungary in 86 I was only 19, we hated the Russians, mainly because we thought the west is paradise and also because we had to learn Russian for eight years. I was cheering when Bush attacked Iraq and was wondering why the South Americans hate the US and not the USSR. After finishing university here I gradually realised that there is no such thing as real media freedom. Trust me, people are not happy at all there. As for freedom, I had more privacy there in the 80s than we have now in Australia. First time I saw a police officer was around the 80s when we travelled to the capital Budapest. As for Assad, he is corrupt but a million times better than the Jihadists that the Saudis and Qataris are financing.

They may be going through tough times now, but they are still far better off than any of the Russian satellites states, or than Russia itself.  And they don't have to worry about substandard nuclear plants blowing up next door and showering them with radioactive soot.
Alert moderator
05 Mar 2014 2:01:48amThis is complete and utter nonsense. My father immigrated from Hungary, I have many relatives who stayed back in Budapest, and I have never met even a single Hungarian who has positive things to say about the Soviet occupation. The Soviets are hated there with a depth of passion roughly equal to the way Russia views the German invaders. Everyone remembers when the Soviets sent in the tanks in 1957 to crush the Hungarian revolution. Around the Hungarian parliament in Budapest there are countless memorials to the uprisings against the USSR and the "martyrs" who stood against them, which are now a deep part of the national psyche. Hungary was one of the states who help break down the Berlin wall and thereby break down the USSR, by letting East germans immigrate to the West via Hungary. Hungary was never a willing subject of the USSR, but were only kept in line via overwhelming military force.Hungary right now has very severe economic problems, and has a huge debt. But I have lived in Budapest for a few months and seen how my cousins live, and whilst they are extremely far from well off and struggle to find work, their quality of live is infinitely better than under the Soviets, and is honestly about the same as in Western Europe. They have modern electronics, go out to restaurants  or bars multiple times a week, shop in malls, go to the gym and the tanning salon etc. No one other than this idiot above wants a return to communism. The majority blame the previous, socialist government for their predicament. The real threat in Hungary is that, in their hatred for communism, people are turning in huge numbers to the extremely fascist party Jobbik.

04 Mar 2014 8:55:47amWhilst this is a good analysis of Russia's motivation it fails to address some of the more recent factors involved in the conflict.Contrary to what most Western media has reported the Euromaidan protests had minority support from the Ukrainian population particularly in the South and East of Ukraine. The vast majority of the population were indifferent to the events seeing it as a standoff between competing forces of equally corrupt politicians on both sides with most of the top opposition political figures, such as Yulia Timoshenko, having estates that rivaled Yanukovich's for opulence. The exception was the Vitali Klitchko who was considered as relatively clean and enjoyed broad support across ethnic and linguistic divides.For many ethnically or linguistically Russian Ukrainians this changed in mid-February when Svoboda and Right Sector decided to stay at the Euromaidan demonstration. Previously these groups had visited, initiated battles using improvised weapons then departed back to their strongholds in Lvov and Rivne. In mid-February those groups brought firearms and explosives and changed what had been a largely peaceful demonstration into a mini civil war. Svoboda is an ultra-nationalist, anti-semitic political party that wants Ukraine for Ukrainians with an agenda to ethnically cleanse Ukraine of ethnic Russians, Tatars, Cossacks, Poles, Ruthenians, and Jews. It claims to be a continuation of the Ukrainian National Army established by Stepan Bandera that initially fought alongside occupying Nazi forces during WW2 and who were implicated in a number of massacres of Ukrainian Jews. A major Svoboda initiative is the banning of languages other than Ukrainian which was one of the first acts of the interim Ukrainian administration. This party includes pan-Ukrainian elements that want to unite Ukrainians even in border districts of neighboring countries such as Poland, Belarus, Slovakia and Hungary.Right Sector is a Right-Wing, anti-Russian terrorist grouping that has members from inside and outside Ukraine. This group has members that claimed on Vkontacte (Russia's equivalent to Facebook) to have fought in Chechnya and Dagestan against Russian forces. On 28 February, before any moves by Russia in the Crimea, Right Sector's Vcontacte page included a call for Islamist terrorists from Chechnya and Dagestan to rise up against Russia. The Russians may view this as tantamount to a declaration of war as Right Sector is largely responsible for the security functions of the interim Ukrainian administration. Right Sector is also implicated in international drug and people trafficking.It is highly unlikely that peace is achievable in Ukraine until Svoboda and Right Sector are removed from the interim administration in Kiev. The presence of Svoboda and Right Sector in the interim Ukrainian administration is seen as a real and present threat to ethnic and linguistic Russians living in Ukraine. Righ

04 Mar 2014 9:28:08amYour article seems clear, relevant and pointed. Putin is entitled to champion the interests of ethnic Russians anywhere, but imperialist past actions have messed the maps. He is not entitled to shoot or occupy. Crimea is not comprehensible to most western observers, being part of the old empire and the USSR. Russians are in a clear majority over all others combined. Strategic considerations are vital to Putin, who feels hemmed in by the seduction of former USSR lands to the west and dopey consumerism. Bankers, probably led and briefed by USA agencies and operatives, are undermining aspects of civilisation and peace, as they did in north Africa, Syria, Thailand and other areas, Laying waste through applied and financed rebellious mercenaries is the new imperialism. Neutering opposition cunningly is better than Nuke threats and expensive wars of degradation and occupation, e g, Iraq and Afghanistan. Russia may well fear a future combination, featuring Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Turkey, crowding the borders and "appealing" to minorities with hollow calls of freedom, whilst being handcuffed to the international banking crooks.

05 Mar 2014 2:44:35amChaz,I have ethnic Russian friends who had participated in the Euromaidan protests since mid-December. Most, but not all, of them are UDAR (Klitchko) supporters. They estimate that until mid-February 25 to 30% of the protesters were ethnic Russians. This is not surprising as it is about proportional with the general Ukrainian population. At that stage most Euromaidan protesters were wanting early elections and regime change through the ballot box not the gun. Then Svoboda and Right Sector arrived and those friends were forced out of the Maidan on ethnic grounds.At no point did I suggest that the people in south and east Ukraine want a Russian presence in Ukraine. What they want, and what my ethnic Ukrainian friends tell me most Ukrainians want, is an independent Ukraine free of corrupt politicians of both sides without the extremist elements. Most people in Ukraine are happy to see Yanukovich gone but are disillusioned by the carve up of the spoils between the Fatherland (Timoshenko) party, which has a history of corruption to rival Yanukovich, and the extremists like Svoboda and Right Sector. In particular, the new Executive is not smart to stir up ethnic tensions by handing over the administration of areas with high proportions of ethnic Russians to ultra-nationalists.

04 Mar 2014 9:02:05amYes, Russia has always been VERY sensitive to the security of its borders. As one of the most invaded countries in history, Russian foreign policy has always been to create buffer & client states on its borders as insulation against foreign aggression. Russia reacts very swiftly and forcibly to border incidents as indeed the Japanese learned at Changkufeng & Nomonhan, the Chinese at the Ussuri River and the Georgians recently in South Ossetia. Russia today perceives quite correctly that the recent USA & EU funded Ukrainian movement to align itself closer to the EU and in effect NATO is an encroachment policy and a direct threat to Russia's security. Hence they are not going to stay quiescent anymore than the Soviets did in Czechoslovakia or Hungary. But apart from Cold War precedents, the Russians have even better legal precedent to legitimise their actions. They could of course cite1) Safeguarding the lives of Russians the Crimea. 2) Defending the democratically elected and illegally overthrown President Yanukovychcy3) Protecting the integrity of the Russian-Ukraine Treaty and the fact that this uprising threatened the security of the Crimean naval Base and the Russians has the right under the treaty to intervene militarily to protect the Crimea.Coincidentally enough, they are 3 of the 4 EXCUSES ....err, reasons... which Bush Snr used to illegally invade Panama in 1989 and seize control of the Panama Canal in defense of the Pax Americana which is enshrined in America's single most important Foreign Policy .... the Monroe Doctrine!In pursuit of that imperialistic policy, the USA has invaded Canada, Mexico and almost every Latin & South American country, setting up military dictatorships with generals posing as "Presidents" in almost the whole South American continent who then enforced "democracy" at the point of made-in-USA M16s and with the help of Death Squads.Even today the USA still force their presence on Cuban soil through their naval base at Gitmo. And in Venezuela the USA is funding "democracy demonstrations" to overthrow the democratically elected but anti-USA govt since their CIA instigated military coups have all failed so far. And of course the invasion of Grenada is a prime example of the USA acting unilaterally to preserve its dominance in the region.So Matt, balance your "analysis" at least with what the Yanks have been and are doing still to give us all a proper perspective on realpolitik.

04 Mar 2014 9:56:12amYou suggest that "As one of the most invaded countries in history, Russian foreign policy has always been to create buffer & client states on its borders as insulation against foreign aggression"What you fail to learn from history is that Russia has historically used the "buffer states" excuse for its own invasions of said "buffer states".Russia is simply an expansionistic nation which has a long and sordid history of invasion, be it Finland, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Romania, Georgia, or Poland.The whole "buffer states" premise is utterly flawed and an outright lie to cover their own desire to obtain living space, strategic locations and resources from other nations.It is worth remembering that when the German armed forces first arrived in the Ukraine in WW2 they were welcomed as liberators from the Soviet yoke (though they were sorely mislead in that respect).

04 Mar 2014 9:07:53amGreat article. The other factor leading inexorably to total mis-understanding is that most Western leaders speak the language of post-modern liberal secularism and Putin does not. Read carefully what the Russians say, and presumably believe. They claim to be acting on behalf of the Russian people in the Ukraine; no acceptance of multiculturalism there, the emphasis is on ethnicity. In addition, Putin's stance on homosexuality merely reflects the position of the Orthodox Church, and indeed the Judeo-Christian tradition of thousands of years. Note how the Russians claim to be worried by the Ukraine's descent into Western decadence, in other words, following current western morality. The Russians are therefore seeing their actions in the Ukraine though an entirely different prism, that of blood and morality. They believe that God is on their side in a contest with the atheistic, decadent and post-Christian West. Their empire is that of righteousness.
Alert moderator
04 Mar 2014 10:00:20amSorry, don't agree.  The Russians may be using religion and "family values" to rally the masses, but this is really about something much more primal - power.  Putin could care less about western decadence (by the way, the political classes of Russia could give lessons in decadence to our politicians).  He wants to rebuild the Russian Empire.  Simple as that.

04 Mar 2014 10:29:29amAgree that the bottom line is power, but power can be cloaked in moral justification, as it is here. Inclined to the view that my earlier post validates the contention, 'other factor leading inexorably to total mis-understanding...' etc.The Russian leadership would be worried that a liberal-secular regime in Ukraine might contaminate their own narrative in Russia. Hence the claim to be acting on behalf of, and as protectors of, the Russian ethnic population of Ukraine.

04 Mar 2014 1:02:15pmTrue.  There's another thing.  Kyiv was the homeland of Kyivan Rus and of the orthodox church.  Although the Ukrainian orthodox Churches differ from the Russian one, the latter tends to take a proprietary attitude towards Kyiv and the various cathedrals and catacombs.  That plays well with the Russian peasantry.

04 Mar 2014 10:01:14amHistory clearly teaches that what Russia says and what Russia thinks are two entirely separate things.While the Russians were categorically stating last week that they will not intervene in the Ukraine/Crimea and will never deploy troops they were in reality actively deploying APC's and armed Russian troops throughout the Crimea (since 21st February) which have subsequently siezed the Crimea.Putin doesn't give too whoots about some mythological figure, he cares about power and power alone (a trait he shares with the religious authorities).

04 Mar 2014 9:11:46amYou're an associate professor in history?Perhaps you can reconcile this statement with some facts: "Having had to fight for its existence against Germany twice in the first half of the twentieth century, the Soviets hung on grimly to a raft of buffer states in Eastern Europe for almost half a century."Are you able to name the two occasions when the Soviet Union fought against Germany for its existence, remembering of course that the Soviet Union didn't exist until 1917 and promptly arranged for peace with Germany in order to complete the October revolution and fight the civil war against the tsarists?Other than that complete falsehood, the article's summation is one I agree with - it's a matter of keeping a buffer from NATO, which has expanded eastwards since 1990.  It's also a none-too-subtle thumbing of the nose at the West, showing it as the toothless tiger it is.

Like the Stalinists of old, they're an illiberal non-democracy who is largely unaccountable to anyone but themselves. Say what you want about the US and the West, but they have to deal with potentially hostile domestic opposition parties that are democratically elected to represent their constituents; potentially hostile media entities whose sole existence often seems to hold the government of the day to account and all the compromise and negotiation that is part and parcel of democratic life. If the US tries on force as a first option, it risks the opprobrium of the world, the opprobrium of its own people, the opprobrium of NBC and CNN, and the very real possibility that it will be voted out at the next eclection. The risk equation is simply much greater for liberal democracies when contemplatign the use fo force. Anyway, comments like the above assume a type of moral equivalance between Putin's Russia and the rest of civilisation that simply does not exist to anyone with a pair of eyes.

04 Mar 2014 9:38:28amCommentator Gabby has outdone the article, with its misleading heading. My reply comments sum up some considerations, but here is the vital one. The world, through the UNO or by some international forums (don't use fora in a general article in plain english) should address the minority positions within nations new and old, with compensation and assistance for emigration if necessary. We have all suffered too much from Sudetenland, Ulster, South Sudan, East Timor, Koenigsgratz, Schleswig-Holstein, Kossovo, Alsace-Lorraine, Quebec, etc, pockets of hatred or resistance or resentment or political dissent. If autonomous nations can be created and controlled, we are all better off.

04 Mar 2014 11:39:32amSpot on Pete2.MAD is still effective.What we will most likely see is the diplomatic acceptance of Russia's occupation of the Crimea. A new nation called the Autonomous Republic of Crimea (or similar). Recognition of this new nation by Russia, China, North Korea, Syria and Iran. Non-recognition of the country by all the western and western affiliated nations.Ukraine has some reasonable armed forces which will put up a reasonable fight so it is unlikely Putin will invade the rest of the Ukraine as he will be largely satisfied with occupying the Crimea and will cut off all gas supplies to the rest of the Ukraine/Europe from time to time to be a economic pain in the proverbial.

04 Mar 2014 4:03:49pmPeople assume that because MAD will prevent a nuclear conflict , it will also prevent a conventional conflict. This is incorrect. MAD is based on the rational assumption that nobody will begin a nuclear war, since it is impossible to win. If you assume that a conventional war will lead to nuclear war, this assumption clashes with MAD.During the Cold War, there was an unspoken fear that Russia would invade Western Europe with a conventional army. Why? Because realistically, America would not end the world for the sake of Europe. What would be the point?

It's that mix of paranoid need for protection that goes back to the days of the Mongol invasions and desire to fit in with those one identifies with.Sadly, Putin's background in the KGB prevents him from accepting that joining up to the EU himself would allow him to 'work within the organisation' for everything he wants for Russia without ending up looking like the throw-back to days long gone clown he's making himself look like more and more with each passing day.Essentially; he's just looking like a brain dead neddie - a one show pony who's only party trick is "chuck the heavy" and "invade" whenever his brain starts to hurt from having to think a problem and it's solutions through.Much like our own politicians here in Australia actually!!!

04 Mar 2014 10:57:57amI really wonder at these sorts of comments. I understand the criticisms of the US and the West, but assuming some sort of moral equivalence between them and the illiberal, non-democratic, neo-Stalinist oligarchy that runs the Kremlin is, to put it mildly, unconvincing. It's much easier for rulers like Putin to  rely on force as first option as they don't have the same level of accountability that liberal democracies do. Putin and all his kinfolk throughout recent history have rarely had any credible opposition parties to contend with, no credible non-state-owned media outlets to contend with...the list goes on. He and his mates are accountable to no-one but themselves - you'd struggle to argue that this is the case for democratic nations who by nature are predisposed to compromise, negotiation and checks and balances...given this is fundamental to their daily existence. Then there's the fact that democracies aren't in the same moral ballpark as regimes like Putin's, given the self-evident virtues of democracy per se and it's demonstrated appeal to the human spirit, but that's possibly another argument.So, yeah, fill your boots, criticise the US to your heart's content, but when viewed in these terms, such criticisms aren't overly persuasive.

04 Mar 2014 10:46:10amWhat I think will happen is that extremists from the west will travel to the Crimea and cause violence (as Russian 'paramilitaries' are on the vodka with the locals). As I said the west had to enlist Soboda as their aid in the 'revolutions' otherwise there would have been no violence. Independent death certificates indicate that many of them were killed by handling explosives stolen from police stations. Normal people would not gouge out the eyes of police officers on the podium in front of cheering neo nazis. There were two occasion so far civilians travelling from the west with large amounts of explosives getting caught. Then we can again blame that on Putin. I also wondering why didn't the Australian media advertised the intercepted phone call between Nuland (whose husband is a main architect in advising on 'regime' changes) and another US diplomat. In that phone call Nuland was not happy with the inability of the EU to organise more 'lively' demonstrations in Kiev.

04 Mar 2014 12:00:48pmPeter if you are concerned about far right extremists in power then you main concern should be with Vladimir Zhirinovsky who openly expresses white supremist and anti semetic views.He is well known for having expressed a desire to reunite countries of the ex Soviet "near abroad" with Russia to within the Russia's borders of 1900 (including Finland and Poland). He has advocated forcibly retaking Alaska from the United States which would then become "a great place to put the Ukrainians" he said.His far right party, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, holds 56 out of the 450 seats in the State Duma. The LDPR was created in April 1991 (the second officially registered party in the country at the time). According to former CPSU Politburo member Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev, the new party was a joint project of CPSU leadership and the KGB. He described how KGB director Vladimir Kryuchkov presented the project of the puppet party at a meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev and informed him about his selection of leaders and the mechanism of funding. Former KGB General Philipp Bobkov described the organization as "Zubatov's pseudo-party under KGB control that directs interests and sentiments of certain social groups".And Mr Putin (the KGB/FSB man) works with this far right anti-semetic, white supremist party that openly advocates the invasion of the Ukraine and all other eastern european nations.This is what you should be concerned about, not a pathetic party in the Ukraine whose leader received 1.43% of the presidential vote.

Zhirinovsky repeatedly denied his father's Jewishness until he published 'Ivan Close Your Soul' in July 2001, describing how his father, Volf Isaakovich Eidelshtein, changed his surname from Eidelshtein to Zhirinovsky. He rhetorically asked, "Why should I reject Russian blood, Russian culture, Russian land, and fall in love with the Jewish people only because of that single drop of blood that my father left in my mother's body?" Another frequently cited quote from Zhirinovsky is "My mother was Russian and my father was a lawyer". Clearly he isn't proud of his ethnicity, much like Joseph Goebbels.

They owned it for a time, after all.  In fact, William the Conqueror was from France, there's an even older claim.The Mongols owned much of Russia and the Middle East, not to mention China and Korea.  Japan also owned Korea for a long time.  There are the French and Spanish who were the European claimants over much of the Americas...Youy have to draw a line somehwere in historical ownership to accept modern realities.

04 Mar 2014 11:30:08amIf the Ukrainians think life will be better under the EU they are dreaming. The EU needed Eastern Europe for dumping their products. Yes, we pay the same prices as in the west, but earn 10 times less. Our GDP is inflated by the prices we pay, not because of prosperity. Actually because of EU regulations it is cheaper to grow nothing on the land. Then after a few years those land is covered with weed. so people from the UK or Holland come in and buy if for next to zero dollars. The only manufacture left is in foreign hands, who pay little tax otherwise would leave. They pay peanuts as well. Maybe it would have been worse if we didn't join the EU, who knows. However the way things are Eastern and Southern Europe is a tinder box.

04 Mar 2014 11:35:52amHello All...It pains me to make this comment as Iam a regular listener of RN & ABCNews24 but the coverage of this "Ukrainian Crisis" has been really poor in my option... I would point out to a number of historical & social connections between the peoples of this region, which in include Russian, Ukraine & Belarus...These peoples have lived & fought wars alongside each other for 1000s of years. They share a common interests as well as social & economic development. They have experienced great tragedy including famines, invasions by Napoleon's Army, The Russian Revolution, 2 World Wars, The Cold War and finally the disintegration of the Soviet as well as uplifting moments like placing 1st human into space, advances in Medicine / Science / Technology. There are 3 countries BUT effectively ONE PEOPLE bound by a common culture & history. Its true they have enormous internal social, economic & social problems to deal with BUT so do we here. All I hear are opinions of experts from Imperial Head Office in Washington - its disgraceful. There is a large Ukrainian community right here in Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra with a number of qualified academics & thinkers who know more about whats going on that those in Washington

04 Mar 2014 1:24:03pmIf you knew the history of Ukraine, you would know that they are not Russians and most of them don't particularly like Russians.  The Ukrainians have a different language, a different alphabet, different churches and a different view of history than the Moscow-centric one.  They do not regard the history of the last couple of hundred years as one of brotherhood, but as one of occupation and oppression, highlighted in particular by the Holodomor.  Yours is a view of Ukraine that Russia would like to believe - but it isn't reality.  The truth is far more complex and nuanced, and I can guarantee you that you won't find many in western or central Ukraine who thinks of the Russians as brothers.

04 Mar 2014 7:00:27pmI am saying three basic things:  First, Ukraine is a divided country, with the Russian speakers in the east and in Crimea looking to Putin, while the Ukrainian speakers in Kyiv and the west look to the EU.  The US and the EU didn't create the divide; it's been there since the days of Tshevchenko.  Second, the relationship between Russia and Ukraine has always been a fraught one.  The Russians see themselves as benevolent big brothers;  many Ukrainians see them as overbearing bullies, responsible for centuries of oppression and repression. And Ukrainians will point to the Holodomor and periodic attempts at Russification to back their views.  It is simplistic to believe that the events of the last few weeks don't spring from a deep distrust of closer links with Russia among a goodly part of the population.  Third, Ukrainians have absolutely no reason to trust their political class, or, for that matter, the Russian one.  Corrupt to the hilt, self-interested and for the most part, unconcerned with the welfare of the people.  That some of them decided, enough is enough, is hardly surprising.  It's been on the cards for years.So, to argue that it's all a dire western plot is to ignore the complexity of Ukrainian history and society.  To claim that only the extreme right is anti-Russian is to ignore the many average Igors and Oksanas who want better and don't see that looking east.  Most of the comments here are seeing this in terms of the Cold War, but the history of this has roots that go back a lot longer.

04 Mar 2014 3:11:10pmFrangipani, you really think yours is the ideal opinion. It is not. You try to convince me that life in Hungary is good. It is not. It is as bad as its ever get. You mentioned substandard nuclear stations next door. Guess what, Russia will build one of the biggest in Europe in Hungary, starting in a few years time. I lived in Hungary, my relatives live there. Education was so good there, that being an average student there enabled me to get an accounting degree with high distinctions. Life in Romania is many times worse than in Hungary. Slovakia is decades behind us. I won't even mention Bulgaria or Albania. The only success stories are the micro countries Lithuania, Lativa, Estonia and Slovenia.

But the fact remains, all the ones that moved into the EU are doing as well as Russia economically, and have the advantage of actually beng somewhat democratic.

04 Mar 2014 1:20:11pmAmongst the whole tapestry of aspects it seems completely forgotten that Western Europe will side with stability in Russia - regardless. As an ex-German I can say that one of the motivations there has always been that instability in Russia will unleash waves of refugees. In the 1920s there were signs in Berlin shops 'German spoken', because the Red Revolution had caused so many to move west. The threat of millions of people fleeing hostilities in Russia is a huge reason to side with whoever can provide stability in Russia, not with the destabilizers or gas pipe saboteuers. The German population doesn't love NATO any more. They loved it when it proetcted the West from Stalinism. Now that that has been defeated, they look at the costs and wonder. They mightn't even fight for the US led NATO any more and remember the old saying 'what happens when the emperor calls for war and nobody comes?"

04 Mar 2014 3:27:33pmI guess most of us still have a fairly clear memory of that extremely tense confrontation between the then Soviet Union and the USA. Fingers were on the buttons that will "home deliver" nuclear missiles to the respective nations.The reason was Cuba. The US will not permit the Soviets get too close to them. Well, nothing personal, really, just that a bit of wriggling room is much appreciated by the US.They both backed off, and we are still here today, writing and pontificating over issues many thousands of KM away.Will the current crisis come to a full-blown war? Not likely as the prize for the West is far too insignificant to bother. The West basically have Russia surrounded, or contained, if you like. Further more, there is no tangible commodities to fight over with for the West, ie. Oil and gas. Yes, there is gas, but it is coming all the way from Russia. If you do a SWOT (Strength/Weakness/Opportunity/Threat) analysis, you will find the West has already enough strength to contain Russia. Opportunity wise, there is none as there is no oil and gas. Weakness is some of the EU nations are dependent on the gas supply, and it is not exactly flushing with cash right now. NATO is only handy when dealing with second-rank military powers such as Libya. Its successes in fighting the wars in the Middle East are few and far between. Threat is only valid if Russia go beyond Ukrain. For Russia, it has far too much to lose if it allows this naval base to slip into NATO's hands. NATO would be wise to let Russia to have this little win as NATO already has more than sufficient containment strength to box in Russia. The key word is "BOX" in. I suppose no one in their right mind would want to be boxed in?

04 Mar 2014 3:45:25pmG'day Matt.Thanks for your article.  Very interesting.Looking around the global map, it seems to have become quite fashionable for countries to hold democratic elections & then find many reasons to boot out those who got elected.  This must be the new democracy.It makes me think that democracy is a rather fragile system, not only in the Ukrain, but wherever it exists.  It relies on a fair amount of good will.  It's particularly vulnerable in a downwardly spiralling economic situation.  Democracy thrives on stability.Those (like me) who love & support democracy, might urge their leaders to consider:#  Systems of taxation, education & immigration that encourage stability of population.#  Living within our means, with a balanced budget every year (as opposed to the growth / debt economic cycle).#  Aiming at population levels based on the natural productive capacity of the country, using safe & appropriate technology.#  Keeping in mind the habitat needs of other species, the environment & the social & cultural preferences of the people.Perpetual growth is not sustainable.  Go forth & stabilise!Regards,Cobber

04 Mar 2014 5:07:19pmReading the comments to opinions in The Drum, I wonder sometimes if is almost ingrained in people to sort out others into Goodies and Baddies, other countries into White hats and Black hats as in the old fashioned cowboy pictures of my youth.In my opinion (no I don't like to shorten it into initials), People overwhelmingly look after their own interests, while occasionally acting equitably and likewise with nations. Powerful people acting in their own interests often behave unfairly to others and so do powerful nations.Rightly or wrongly the rulers of Russia have always regarded their security as being connected to access to warm water ports and will go to great lengths to protect their perceived interests. Although the USA has many warm water ports and therefore does not feel as vulnerable as Russia, it's leaders have felt that America has a vital interest in the Panama Canal.Neither Russia nor the USA has allowed legality or any other constraint to interfere with what each considers to be a vital national interest.I don't like this and I think most people outside of those two major powers don't like it either, but trying to pick the goodies and baddies is not going to help anybody. Even worse than this Great Power bullying (for that is what it usually becomes), is warfare to try to "solve" the problems. We should have learned enough in the 20th century to know that the huge destruction and miseries caused by Industrial Warfare is not the solution.  You can call it appeasement if you like, but I think that the stand off between the USA (and allies) and The Soviet Union (and allies) gave a great lesson to the world.The Soviet Union eventually collapsed from it's own internal contradictions. Some say that the USA WON, I'm not so sure, I think that all of us (the survivors of the NON WAR) were the real winners.I'm sorry, but I don't welcome any Don Quihotes (sorry I've forgotten how to spell his name) trying to impose a more equitable solution.If I lived in a border State to one of the great powers, I'm sure that I would not like to be treated as they are treated, but most of such States or Nations have learned to live with it without liking it.

04 Mar 2014 11:54:51pmGood point Travis! Could not agree more.Another thing that comes out to the surface in this Ukrainian affair is what is really meant in the News media by the oft abused term like DEMOCRACY. You can see the historic "progress" of democracy, the NAKED FACE of democracy, also in other former Communist countries of Europe.First of all it means the establishment of a foreign based financial elite, an oligarchy directed from the Western banks or the IMF, who take the possession of the media outlets and the police, and then use the natural and human resources of the country for accelerated exploitation. Like in Australia, the voters are marched off to the polling boot to elect a series of filtered, pre-programmed candidates, who are not responsible to their nation in formulating economic policy. Any survivals of the national health system for the old and poor is savagely cut, huge chunks of society are condemned to the swamp of unemployment, for decay in extreme poverty, for prostitution, for crime, for the cheap unregulated labour that the Western investors may find the use of. Not to mention the military who take the cream of manhood in each Eastern European country in order to fight American sponsored wars of conquest, to keep the so called peace keeping operations.All that is justified in terms of the hollow, childish phrases, like the "independence", "political freedom", "democracy", "development" and the like. Russian oligarchs are hated in the West because they want to play an EQUAL PARTNERSHIP ROLE in the exploitation of their national natural resources without taking a second place to the Western exploiters. This was part of "the deal" between the Russian and American oligarchs ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Although such deal on EQUAL PARTNERSHIP between the foreign financiers and domestic oligarchs in building capitalism  was never unilaterally ratified between Russia and the United States, it was based on a mutual understanding even in the Gorbachev era. The collateral to such a mutual understanding was the Russian nuclear arsenal, which meant that the United States could never cross the Red Line in asserting its priority over the Russian natural resources and Russian property in former Soviet republics.
