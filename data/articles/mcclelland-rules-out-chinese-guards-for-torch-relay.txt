Federal Attorney-General Robert McClelland has backed the Prime Minister in again refusing to allow Chinese guards to protect the Olympic torch relay when it passes through Canberra.The Government says Chinese officials will be restricted to a bus travelling behind the torch.International Olympic Committee (IOC) board member, Kevan Gosper, yesterday suggested Chinese officials could be called on for help if Australian police cannot manage protesters.But Mr McClelland has told ABC's AM program that is wrong and he does not know the root of Mr Gosper's comments."I literally don't know, I don't know, I haven't spoken to Kevan but clearly they won't, clearly it will only be the Australian Federal Police who are entirely experienced in this sort of thing," he said.Police have been granted extra authority during the relay period to search people and to seize items, including eggs, paint bombs, fire extinguishers and flares.ACT Chief Minister Jon Stanhope says police asked for the enhanced powers after learning that major groups of pro and anti-China groups will be descending on Canberra for the torch relay."The police have advised us in order to allow us to be proactive, not to be forced to react as other security forces and polices have around Australia," Mr Stanhope said."This does give us an opportunity to be proactive, hopefully to protect the relay and to allow the relay to proceed without disruption."As the national capital we are used to demonstrations. As the home of the national parliament it's the place where there are often demonstrations."Our police are perhaps more experienced and more able to anticipate the sorts of trouble and responses that are needed."Mr Stanhope says fire extinguishers, eggs and flares will be banned, as well as bottled water.But he says he does not think it will be a problem for people waiting to see the torch."The route has been published, there are 80 runners all traversing 250 metres, the relay moves past a post within a minute or two so there won't be people standing for hours," he said."It's an extensive and expansive course of almost 20 kilometres on broad boulevards and wide streets."Mr Stanhope says there will be no banning of flags and banners."We support the right of people to freedom of expression," he said."The Government took the decision in the context of our support for human rights, we're not banning banners."A Chinese Australian student says he is encouraging his fellow countrymen and women not to go near Tibetan protesters during next week's Australian leg of the Olympic torch relay.A flyer which has been posted on a student website encourages Chinese Australian students to "protect" the Olympic torch in Canberra.But student Zhang Rongan says that has been misinterpreted.He says the Chinese community is not angry about the disruption of the torch relay so far, and they want a peaceful event next week."We hope that it will not be political," he said."The torch is just a torch, its just the symbol of the Olympic Games and the Olympic Games is sports, not politics."
