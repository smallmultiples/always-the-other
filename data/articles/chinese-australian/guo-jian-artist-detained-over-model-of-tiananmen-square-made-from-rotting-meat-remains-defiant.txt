A Chinese-Australian artist recently detained in Beijing over a controversial model of Tiananmen Square sculpted with rotting meat has vowed he will not be silenced and has revealed plans for another confronting sculpture.Guo Jian, a former soldier and propaganda artist with China's People's Liberation Army, is currently in New York City working on a new project, five months after being detained and later deported back to Sydney.But he remains defiant despite the 15-day ordeal."This makes me feel more strong and it gave me all kinds of strength to do my art," Mr Guo told Lateline."I feel that I should just keep going to make people know I'm still standing, nothing can really knock me down." Mr Guo denies accusations by the Chinese government of visa fraud.The artist said he was targeted because of his sculpture covered in rotting meat which gained international attention on the eve of the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. While in detention he said he initially feared being raped in a cell shared by 12 other inmates.But the reality of his imprisonment was more mundane than threatening."[You] either watch TV or just sit there. If you don't really sit there properly they will ask you to stand up against the wall," he said."They tried to get me 'back to normal' and saw me as a kind of naughty boy."Mr Guo said while he was detained he thought about his art to kill time and drew inspiration from the birds he could see from a window."Every day I just looked at the sparrows thinking about my art. They could detain me but they can't really detain my soul. My soul is just like the sparrows."Mr Guo is now collaborating with a group of American artists for an anti-war exhibition called Surrender.He is planning to create a large-scale cityscape covered in rotting meat to represent the problems caused by rapid development in China."We're building up a new city based on destroying the old cities," he said."We've already destroyed the old culture and building up something based on just making money."
