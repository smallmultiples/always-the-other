A Chinese-Australian man running for Pauline Hanson's One Nation in the West Australian election has declared the party's leader is not "anti-Asian".Senator Hanson has endorsed Tshung Chang to contest the WA Treasurer Mike Nahan's seat of Riverton.He said he planned to campaign for a better share of the Goods and Services Tax for WA and apply scrutiny to politician's travel expenses.Asked whether he remembered Senator Hanson's first speech to parliament in 1996 where she said Australia was "in danger of being swamped by Asians," Mr Chang said he did."Yes I do, I think that was the infamous speech, however that was I think 20, as you rightly said, 25 years ago and I think she's actually become more and more experienced since then and the views back then are not reflective of what they are today because of her life experiences.""Pauline has got nothing against Asians, nothing against Asians that work hard, that come here and are good citizens."Nothing could be further from the truth to say that she's anti-Asian or anti any particular race."What has not changed in two decades is Pauline Hanson's star power.As Senator Hanson walked through the streets of Bunbury, south west of Perth yesterday, voters clamoured for photos with her. Izzy Taylor was one of them."Mum was like, 'get a photo with her'," she said.Ms Taylor didn't nominate any One Nation policies she liked, instead saying she would vote for the party because of Senator Hanson's celebrity status."And obviously because mum and dad wanted her to win."The WA election will be held on March the 11th.It is expected to be a close contest and both sides of politics view One Nation as a wildcard with the power to influence the outcome.
