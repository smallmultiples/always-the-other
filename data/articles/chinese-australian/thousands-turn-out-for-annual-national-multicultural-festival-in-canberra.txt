Tens of thousands of people flocked to Canberra's National Multicultural Festival each day during the three-day event to sample cultures and food from around the world.The annual event attracted 250,000 visitors last year. Despite rain dampening the festival on Saturday night, organisers were hoping to attract even larger crowds for the 19th festival this year.ACT Chinese Australian Association president Chin Wong said the event was always extra festive for the Chinese community, as they celebrated the lead-up to Chinese New Year on Thursday. "We have a whole day program and most of the shows are performed by the local Chinese community group," she said."But we also have some international performers and inter-state performers."She said one of the crowd's favourite performances was the "lion dance"."The lions symbolise good luck, so every year, before the new year, they do the lion dance to chase away all the evil and unlucky spirits," she said.Ms Wong said the programs helped Canberra's many international Chinese students celebrate Chinese New Year away from home."When you are celebrating Chinese New Year overseas there's not much atmosphere," she said."We try to create it so that everybody feels at home."Health Minister Simon Corbell used the National Multicultural Festival as an opportunity to launch a new handbook to help Canberra's multicultural community understand the ACT health system."For many Canberrans who come from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, this new resource will become a household tool, which can help them, their family and friends to better understand the health system in the ACT," he said."Research shows there is a strong link between people with low knowledge of the health system or limited English skills and poor health outcomes." Mr Corbell said a report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in 2009 showed that only 33 per cent of people born overseas had adequate health literacy, compared with 43 per cent of the Australian-born population."Health literacy dropped to 27 per cent for people who had arrived in Australia in the previous five years, and 26 per cent for people who did not speak English as a first language," he said.The handbook, Using Health Services in the ACT, includes information about which health services should be used for different health problems, when the service is available, where it is located and how to pay for health services."The resource also has important information for asylum seekers, refugees and migrants who are new to Canberra on how to obtain a Medicare card, Centreline Concession Card or an ACT Services Card, where eligible," Mr Corbell said.
