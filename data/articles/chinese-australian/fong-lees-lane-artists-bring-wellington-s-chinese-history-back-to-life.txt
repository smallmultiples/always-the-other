To the untrained eye, it is a one-way lane lined with dumpsters but those in the know can feel the magic of Fong Lees Lane, tucked away in Wellington, New South Wales.The iconic passageway peels off the town's main street at an eye-catching angle, but until recently there were few clues to mark the spot where a wondrous Chinese-run department store stood during the rich gold rush era.Now, with the help of paper lanterns and pots of paint, the town's residents are breathing new life into the lane to celebrate the exotic history of Fong Lee & Co, and the Ling family's generous contribution to the town."It's amazing how many people say 'I've just never known there was something so incredible here'," local artist Natacha Richards said. Ms Richards and a group of fellow artists have spent the past few weeks "awakening the spirit of Wellington's old Chinatown" by painting murals down the length of the laneway.On Friday the full extent of the lane's transformation was revealed to a 2,000-strong crowd who feasted on Chinese treats in the company of a dancing red dragon."Now the lane is so colourful Wellington has really had its interest piqued when it comes to its Chinese-Australian history, and now I'm hoping they want to keep learning," Ms Richards said. Chinese-Australian Wellington resident Tim Sing Lee said he felt a huge sense of pride seeing the laneway come to life."It looked like a crowded alleyway in Hong Kong," he said."It felt like a true marketplace."Fong Lees Lane was once the bustling domain of the Ling family and their famed department store, Fong Lee & Co.While the entrance to the grand store was on Nanima Street, Fong Lees Lane led to its warehouse, which was packed with trunks of imported materials, manchester, boots and shoes, clothing, ironmongery, and crockery. Touted by the Lings in their local newspaper as a store in which "not a want of the housewife would go unsatisfied", the store also stocked a wide range of "unique" Chinese gifts including teas, trinkets and scents. At the helm of the business was William Suey Ling.Mr Ling was born in Melbourne in 1877 and took ownership of the store from his uncle in 1896.He ran the business, which occupied a full town block on Nanima Crescent, with the help of Chinese workers whose passage he arranged and housed above the store.More than 80 years on from his death, Mr Ling's family and the wider Wellington community remember his generosity."By all accounts my grandfather was generous in extending credit to farmers and those who needed it most," Mr Ling's grandson Geoff Young said."I believe it was his generosity which contributed to the business going bankrupt in 1935, but I believe it was the Great Depression which sealed its fate."While murals are bringing Fong Lees Lane back to life, the Ling family residence at 29 Warne Street is also undergoing a transformation.Built in 1910, William Suey and his wife Alice's home is of red brick construction and was extended continually to accommodate their seven sons and two daughters. The house stood empty following the deaths of the Ling's children, but last year Susan Culbert bought the "charming" property as a renovation project."I thought the house had a very happy face to it and when I had heard about the Ling family and the Chinese-Australian link I was very interested in restoring the home in a style sympathetic to its historic features," Ms Culbert said.Fortunately for Ms Culbert the sale of the Ling's home also included the rustic Fong Lee & Co warehouse."If you look under the floorboards in the shed you can see a tunnel going from one end to the other," she said."We looked for them but there weren't any treasures."Along the original shelving you can see sizing markers, and it made me wonder what they might have stored there while the department store was operating." Mr Ling's obituary shows he was held in the highest regard by his community, but letters to Wellington's local paper show not all Chinese families were as accepted by Europeans at the turn of the century.Several letters in the Wellington Times from 1899 to 1905 featured complaints about the town's Chinese people and their quarters.In 1904 a letter writer lamented Wellington was "fast becoming a Chinese town".Earlier, another writer described "a White Australia but a speckled Wellington".Aboriginal people also faced prejudice and discrimination in the town. The two groups came together in the patchwork of Chinese-run market gardens that once spread from the junction of the Bell and Macquarie Rivers right up to the Wellington Caves.Mr Sing Lee, a market gardener himself, remembers that almost all of the Wellington Chinese gardeners in the 1940s and 1950s used Aboriginal labourers who were paid at the same rate as Europeans.He recalls employing 30 to 40 Aboriginal men. He would drive out to the Nanima Reserve, pick up the workers and take them back with melons and vegetables at the end of the day."The Aboriginal people were good and honest people," Mr Sing Lee said."They were very friendly and they did a good day's work."In a nod to the enduring friendships between Wellington's Chinese and Aboriginal communities, Friday's party in Fong Lees Lane proudly featured bush tucker.
