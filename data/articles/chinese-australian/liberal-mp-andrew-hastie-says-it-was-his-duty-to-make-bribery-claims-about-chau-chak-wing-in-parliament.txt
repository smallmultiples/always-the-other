Liberal backbencher Andrew Hastie says it was his duty to use parliamentary privilege to accuse the Chinese Communist Party of covertly seeking to influence Australia's media, universities and politics. Mr Hastie, who chairs the powerful intelligence and security committee, claimed in Parliament last night that Chinese-Australian businessman Chau Chak Wing "co-conspired to bribe" a senior United Nations official.He said Dr Chau funded the bribery of former president of the UN General Assembly John Ashe.Dr Chau's lawyer Mark O'Brien said his client was very "disappointed that an elected representative would use the cover of parliamentary privilege to repeat old claims and attack his reputation just weeks before some of these matters are tested in court".He noted Dr Chau had not been charged with any offence and said that made "Mr Hastie's attack all the more extraordinary"."Mr Hastie purports to be acting in the interests of Australians, it seems he has forgotten or disregarded the right all Australian citizens have to a presumption of innocence unless proven otherwise," he said.Dr Chau, who is an Australian citizen, has donated to both the Liberal and Labor parties in the past decade. Mr Hastie noted that Dr Chau had sued media organisations for defamation over its coverage of him.He said the merits of the defamation cases were appropriately left for a court.But the MP said he chose to speak in Parliament because of his concern that defamation cases could have a chilling effect on the free press."Any attempt to silence our media from telling the truth — provided it is the truth — through a defamation claim cannot stand," Mr Hastie said."Our democracy works only if we have a free press that can publish information that serves the public interest."Mr O'Brien said a defamation case against the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper was due to be heard on June 12."Our client looks forward to the hearing taking place and he is confident of being vindicated," Mr O'Brien said.Earlier today, the Prime Minister said he had no forewarning that Mr Hastie would give the speech and that it was not fresh information."As far as the specific allegations that were made, they are not new," Mr Turnbull said."They are in fact the subject of litigation currently in the Australian courts and for that reason I don't propose to say any more about them."Trade Minister Steve Ciobo warned that parliamentary privilege should only be used with an extraordinary amount of caution."Ultimately the media, the public, will be arbiters about whether or not he has achieved that balance, but I make the point again that there wasn't anything said in Parliament last night that hasn't already been in the public domain," Mr Ciobo said. Parliamentary privilege allows politicians to speak freely inside the chambers, without a risk of defamation action. Mr Hastie said he had carefully considered his responsibilities as a member of Parliament.He said the matter he raised "poses a threat to our democratic tradition, particularly the freedom of the press and our national sovereignty".According to Mr Hastie, a court indictment relating to the bribery referred to one of the co-conspirators as CC-3.   Mr Hastie said the bribe amounted to $200,000. He recently met with United States authorities about espionage and foreign interference legislation, and said it was during those discussions he confirmed the "long-suspected identity of CC-3" as Dr Chau. "The same man who co-conspired to bribe the United Nations president of the General Assembly, John Ashe," Mr Hastie said. "The same man with extensive contacts in the Chinese Communist Party, including the United Front. "I share it with the House because I believe it to be in the national interest. My duty, first and foremost, is to the Australian people and the preservation of the ideals and democratic traditions of our Commonwealth."That tradition includes a free press." The matter was briefly raised in question time when Labor leader Bill Shorten asked Mr Turnbull if he had sought advice from security agencies about Mr Hastie's actions."Has the Prime Minister sought advice from our security agencies about the implications of publicly sharing a confidential briefing about an FBI investigation, which has been provided by our ally?" he asked.Mr Turnbull said he had sought advice but gave no further details.In Parliament last night, Mr Hastie tabled a "sensitive" US State Department cable from 2007.He said Dr Chau had "close contact with the United Front, the influence arm of the Chinese Communist Party in 2007"."So what is the connection to Australia? CC-3 is a Chinese-Australian citizen," Mr Hastie told Parliament."He has also been a very significant donor to both of our major political parties. He has given more than $4 million since 2004. He has also donated $45 million to universities in Australia."The Australian press has reported these matters and others and have been sued for defamation by CC-3. CC-3 disputes a number of the reported allegations."The merits of these defamation cases are appropriately left for a court. My concern is that defamation cases can have a chilling effect on our free press."Mr Hastie also used his speech to accuse China of seeking to influence Western democracies."In Australia, it is clear that the Chinese Communist Party is working to covertly interfere with our media, our universities and also influence our political processes and public debates."
