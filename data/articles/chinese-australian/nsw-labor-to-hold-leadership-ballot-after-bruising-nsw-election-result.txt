The NSW Labor Party has confirmed it will wait until after the federal election to hold a leadership ballot, in which Shadow Water Minister Chris Minns is expected to take on Michael Daley for the top job. State Opposition Leader Michael Daley has made it clear he wants to stay on in the role, but the ABC understands Shadow Water Minister Chris Minns will run against him and Shadow Transport Minister Jodi McKay could also put her hand up.A Labor statement said it the party was now concentrating on the federal election, and the NSW caucus would open nominations for the position of state leader after that.It was a disappointing state election campaign for Labor and Mr Daley, who have so far picked up only two seats from the Government.On election night, NSW Education Minister Rob Stokes said Mr Minns was "seen as a potential future leader"."In the Parliament we call him 'Simba' from the Lion King because, one day this will all be his," Mr Stokes said, referring to Macquarie Street. Labor MPs have been directed to refrain from commenting on, or campaigning for the leadership until that time.Senior Labor sources say under the party's rules in NSW, Michael Daley must remain leader until the close of nominations, meaning he could be "in limbo" for almost two months.Under changes made to Labor's rules several years ago, any new state leader is chosen by a combination of a caucus ballot and a vote of rank-and-file party members.Mr Daley has been Opposition Leader for only 19 weeks, after replacing Luke Foley, who resigned suddenly when it was revealed he sexually harassed an ABC journalist at a 2016 Christmas party.Labor narrowly won the seat of Coogee off the Liberal Party, while they also won Upper Hunter off the Nationals.They remain locked in close races with the Government in Lismore and East Hills. Labor MPs are dismissive of Mr Daley's prospects of retaining the leadership, with one telling the ABC yesterday: "I reckon he's toast."This morning, when asked if he was going to be resigning, Mr Daley said: "No not at all."While Mr Daley started the election campaign on the front foot, the final few days were a disaster.First, a video emerged of him telling a Labor function last year that young people were leaving Sydney because "Asians with PhDs" were taking their jobs.Then, during the final televised election debate, he was unable to recall how much some of his party's signature education policies would actually cost.Several Labor MPs have said the final week was damaging. The comments about immigration were particularly damaging for challenger Mr Minns, who has a high Chinese-Australian population in his Sydney seat of Kogarah.Mr Minns endured a swing of about 4 per cent against him in the seat — not enough for him to lose it, but enough to make his previously safe electorate marginal.This morning Mr Minns told the ABC his attention is on retaining the seat."At the moment we're focusing on the seat of Kogarah," he said.
