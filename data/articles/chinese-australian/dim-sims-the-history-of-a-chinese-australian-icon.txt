Dancing dragons and firecrackers wowed the crowds at Lunar New Year celebrations at the weekend, but many more people around the country may have sampled a piece of Chinese-Australian history without even knowing it. The simple dim sim, served in fish and chip shops around the country, is an example of traditional Chinese cuisine being adapted for the Anglo-Australian palate. Celebrity chef Elizabeth Chong is known to television audiences from her appearances on Ten Network show Good Morning Australia with Bert Newton in the 1990s and 2000s.She told 774 ABC Melbourne's Red Symons that her father, William Chen Wing Young, invented and popularised the Australian dim sim in the 1940s.Ms Chong said her father noticed that Australians visiting his restaurant, Wing Lee in Melbourne's Chinatown, particularly enjoyed the tiny pork mince dim sum dumplings called siu mai.Sensing a business opportunity, Mr Wing Young adapted the recipe to create a commercial version and produced them in a factory "by the thousands", Ms Chong said.While Australians loved eating siu mai, its name proved too much of a mouthful for the English-speaking population and a new moniker was needed for the mass-produced snack food."They called it a dim sim because in my dialect we don't say dim sum, we say dim sim," Ms Chong said. She said dim sum translated as "dot heart â€” foods that are so small and dainty they touch your heart, or dot your heart, and they don't hit your stomach".The Australianised siu mai however has grown steadily bigger and heartier, with today's dimmies likely to have an impact on both the stomach and the heart. The dim sim is not Mr Wing Young's only contribution to the menu board of Australian fish and chip shops.He also commercialised the chicken roll, which was later adapted by Australian businessman Frank McEnroe into the chickenless Chiko Roll.Mr Wing Young's rolls were so successful that he was known as the "chicken roll king".
