Former NSW Labor powerbroker John Della Bosca says the two major political parties are locked in a funding arms race and has called for drastic reform of political donations."I think the political arms race has been going on, not just in NSW but around the country," he told 7.30."A whole range of additional costs around campaigning has meant that there has been a reach out to get more funds and of course that has meant more and more fundraising and that has put more and more risk around fundraising and the integrity of it."He says that the lines between donations, access and influence have become too close."The idea that someone can buy access is just as bad almost as buying the decision," Mr Della Bosca said."And I think there's another level, which is perhaps a murkier level, which is the suggestion that by making contributions of a sufficient scale, corporations can influence particular decisions." Ernest Wong has made little impact in the NSW parliament since being elected three years ago but behind the scenes he plays a much bigger role.He is the key link between NSW and federal Labor politicians and a small clique of wealthy Chinese-Australian businessmen. "Anyone who is active in the Chinese community in Australia knows who Ernest is," Asian Australian Alliance convenor Erin Chew told 7.30."Some people may not necessarily like him but they will respect him because he is in an important position, he is a politician, he does have links to Chinese businesses, he does know a lot of people and he has access to the Labor politicians, including people like Bill Shorten, Tanya Plibersek, the senior politicians," Ms Chew said.Mr Wong moved to Australia in the late 1970s as a student to study commerce. Since then he has lived in and around Burwood.He ran a company offering "personal relationship consultation" for a time, and was a professional singer for hire until 2001, when he was elected to Burwood council.There he become close with Burwood mayor John Faker, and through Faker was introduced to the ultimate NSW powerbroker, Eddie Obeid.Ernest Wong was exposed to the rough side of NSW politics while at Burwood council.In 2011 the NSW corruption watchdog, ICAC, found the council's general manager had acted corruptly, and it twice investigated John Faker.There is no suggestion Ernest Wong was involved and John Faker was cleared both times.Ernest Wong also grew close to another Labor figure while at the council — Sam Dastyari.In early 2013, Wong was parachuted into a vacant upper house seat by the State executive, then run by Sam Dastyari.A friend both Mr Wong and Senator Dastyari have in common is Huang Xiangmo. Last year, 7.30 shone a spotlight on Mr Huang, a little-known property developer who moved to Australia five years ago.He and his company, the Yuhu Group, have donated millions to both parties.Within the ALP he is now the go-to man when the party needs money from the Chinese community.More than half-a-dozen senior NSW Labor politicians that 7.30 have spoken to all said Ernest Wong was brought into parliament to court the Chinese vote and because of his record as a prodigious fundraiser.In his maiden speech to the NSW parliament in May 2013, Wong thanked Sam Dastyari, who was sitting in the chamber with Huang Xiangmo.The spot Ernest Wong took belonged to the former NSW treasurer, Eric Roozendaal, who had left parliament hounded by corruption allegations. Mr Roozendaal moved straight into a high-paying role at the Yuhu Group, the company owned and run by one of Ernest Wong's most important donors, Mr Huang.Mr Huang's political support extends beyond party lines.Since the Liberals came to power in NSW in 2013, Mr Huang has overwhelmingly donated to them.And he also developed a close relationship with Australia's then trade minister, Andrew Robb, twice paying for him to be his guest at the Melbourne Cup.When Andrew Robb retired, his press secretary, Cameron Hill, became Mr Huang's spokesman.One of the key vehicles for Huang Xiangmo's flourishing relationship with the ALP is the "Chinese Friends of Labor" group, which is run by Ernest Wong.It has been around for decades, but since Mr Wong's involvement, it has become a particularly good money spinner. "It operates like a typical Chinese-style banquet event — that is the main source that the donations come in," Erin Chew said."Obviously there are other ways that I am not aware of, but I am aware of these fundraising dinners and they do fundraise quite a lot of money."And the more you pay, the closer you get to power.Erin Chew describes it as cash for access."[If] you are someone who donates a lot of money, you will definitely get the central table where the leader of the opposition or the prime minister will sit," she said."They'll put those important people, those people that they want support from in those positions in those good tables."Joo-Cheong Tham is Associate Professor of Law at Melbourne University and specialises in the relationship between money and politics.He believes the recent political scandal over a Chinese-linked company paying for Sam Dastyari's travel expense overspend is symptomatic of a wider problem in Australian politics."I think it has highlighted what has been evident for many years: that at the federal level we have laissez-faire regulation of money politics, that largely comprises of weak disclosure laws, and worse we have a laissez-faire culture within the major parties," he told 7.30. It has these weak disclosure laws which, he says, allow donors and politicians to avoid proper scrutiny."Propriety has largely been reduced to legality, and large amounts of corporate money is being received, sometimes shrouded in secrecy, often without proper controls around conflicts of interest," he said."I think it is fair to say this is the most recent in a long line of controversies on political donations."John Della Bosca agrees and says major changes are needed."I think the recent events on a number of issues highlight the need for drastic reform of political donations law," he said."It's something that we have been incremental about for a generation, and we have ended up with one big mess and I think that the public are crying out for change to make sure that our political process is transparent and seen to be fair."
