The New South Wales Government is reviewing a controversial Chinese Government-sponsored program to teach Mandarin in schools, amid claims it could expose children to propaganda.Teaching assistants appointed by the Chinese Communist Party are working in 13 public schools around NSW under the Confucius Classrooms program.The program also provides cash grants from the Chinese Government's Hanban Institute, and operates in several private schools.A spokesman for Education Minister Rob Stokes confirmed a Chinese Government-funded travel program for NSW school principals to visit that country had been postponed.Mr Stokes' spokesman said the Government was now investigating concerns raised about Confucius Classrooms."The Department of Education's relationship with the Confucius Institute is currently under review to ensure that there are no inappropriate influences from foreign powers," the spokesman said."It would be inappropriate to comment further until this review has concluded."The move was welcomed by Taiwanese community member Carole Lu, who has avoided enrolling her daughter in a school that offered the Confucius program because she was concerned it would promote China's political agenda."I'm worried about what kind of culture they are going to teach the children, that's the thing as a mother," she said."I worry about the propaganda. The Government needs to make sure it's non-political."Ms Lu said she was particularly concerned that teaching aides might tell students about political issues surrounding Taiwan and Tibet.The president of the China Australia Forum, Benjamin Chow, said he had not had any Chinese-Australian parents tell him they were concerned about the Confucius Classrooms program."But if there is any propaganda element or inappropriate content, then they need to have a look at that," Mr Chow said."If it is just a curriculum providing Mandarin classes, I think it is a good thing."
