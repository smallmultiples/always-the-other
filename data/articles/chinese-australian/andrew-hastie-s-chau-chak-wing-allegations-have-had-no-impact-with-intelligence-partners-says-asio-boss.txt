The nation's spy chief says there has been no impact on relationships with intelligence partners, after allegations were made in Federal Parliament about a Chinese-Australian businessman.In a dramatic speech this week, Government backbencher Andrew Hastie said real estate developer Chau Chak Wing co-conspired to bribe a United Nations official in 2013 with a $200,000 payment.Mr Hastie, who chairs Parliament's joint committee on intelligence and security, also used his speech to claim the Chinese Communist Party is working covertly to interfere with Australia's media, universities and political processes.During a Senate Estimates Hearing, ASIO boss Duncan Lewis confirmed to Labor's Louise Pratt he met with Malcolm Turnbull after Mr Hastie made the statement."Have you been asked to take any other action by the Prime Minister?" Senator Pratt asked."No. I said that I met with the Prime Minister and we had a discussion," Mr Lewis responded.Senator Pratt asked what impact Mr Hastie's disclosure has had on Australia's relationship with intelligence allies."In the discussions that I've had, none, Senator." Earlier this week, Dr Chau's lawyer Mark O'Brien said his client was very "disappointed that an elected representative would use the cover of parliamentary privilege to repeat old claims and attack his reputation just weeks before some of these matters are tested in court".He noted Dr Chau had not been charged with any offence and said that made "Mr Hastie's attack all the more extraordinary". Mr Lewis told the estimates hearing he only became aware of the "prospect" of Mr Hastie making the speech "about an hour and half before he made the statement"."My understanding is that he had had a discussion with a junior officer in my organisation but there was certainly no authority, there was no sense of clearance being given."There was no approach to ASIO formally to provide clearance for what was said."Mr Hastie said he had a "duty" to share the information, after a briefing from United States authorities, and the US embassy has made it clear it is not uncomfortable with his actions.An embassy spokesperson has told the ABC diplomatic relations between the two nations are as strong as ever.
