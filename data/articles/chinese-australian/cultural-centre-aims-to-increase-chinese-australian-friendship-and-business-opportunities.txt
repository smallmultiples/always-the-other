A group of Chinese-Australians in regional New South Wales wants to increase cross-cultural understanding and business opportunities between China and Australia through tea ceremonies, tai chi classes and costume dress-ups. One of the group founders, John Cui, is passionate about the country of his birth and his home at Orange in central-west NSW, a place he fell in love with nearly 20 years ago while an exchange student at the local agricultural college."I just want to push Chinese culture to the regional area and let Australian people know a little bit more of traditional Chinese culture," Mr Cui said.According to the 2011 census, about 0.6 per cent of the population of Orange was of an ethnic Chinese background. It is a relatively small part of the population and may not be immediately noticeable, just like the unassuming door off the city's main street that leads up a narrow staircase to the Orange Chinese Cultural Centre.Inside are four rooms decked out with large colourful artworks and space for displays of aspects of traditional Chinese culture. The centre offers demonstrations in calligraphy, dress-up sessions for children in traditional Chinese costumes, the teaching of martial arts, and tea ceremonies.There are also plans to introduce Mandarin classes."But to learn a different language is really boring, so I want to combine learning mandarin and calligraphy together, so they will have more things to do and not only to learn how to say these things in Chinese," Mr Cui said. Mr Cui said learning a phrase or two in Mandarin would also be good for Australian-Chinese relations."It attracts people to say Ni Hao, but not hello or g'day. We have different ways of greeting," Mr Cui explained.As well as being a way of introducing Chinese culture to regional NSW, the centre is also a business venture for Mr Cui and his partner in the project Dong Liu."We want to set up a platform for further sharing between China and Australia," said Mr Cui, who works as a tour guide for Chinese visitors to Australia."Maybe we will have more business cooperation in the vineyard, orchards and also tourism as well, [and] keep bringing people to visit regional areas." Mr Liu agreed not all reactions to increased Chinese investment in Australia were positive."Sure China is getting rich and looking for investments all over the world, just like Japan did decades ago," he said."But I think this shouldn't be considered as a threat for Australia. We should see it as opportunities that can benefit both sides and everyone if they try to get involved."
