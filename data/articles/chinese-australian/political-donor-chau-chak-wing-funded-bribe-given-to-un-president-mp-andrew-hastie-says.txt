A Chinese-Australian real estate developer "co-conspired to bribe" a senior United Nations official, according to claims made in Federal Parliament. Andrew Hastie, who chairs the powerful intelligence and security committee, used parliamentary privilege to claim businessman Chau Chak Wing funded the bribery of former president of the UN General Assembly John Ashe.Dr Chau, who is an Australian citizen, has donated to both the Liberal and Labor parties in the past decade.According to Mr Hastie, Dr Chau was referred to in a court indictment relating to the bribery as "Co-Conspirator 3 or CC-3".Mr Hastie, a Liberal MP, said the bribe amounted to $200,000.He recently met with United States authorities about espionage and foreign interference legislation, and said it was during those discussions he confirmed the "long-suspected identity of CC-3" as Dr Chau."The same man who co-conspired to bribe the United Nations president of the General Assembly, John Ashe," Mr Hastie said."The same man with extensive contacts in the Chinese Communist Party, including the United Front."I share it with the house because I believe it to be in the national interest. My duty, first and foremost, is to the Australian people and the preservation of the ideals and democratic traditions of our Commonwealth."That tradition includes a free press."The ABC has attempted to contact Dr Chau but no response has been received. In parliament on Tuesday night, Mr Hastie tabled a "sensitive" US State Department cable from 2007.He said Dr Chau had "close contact with the United Front, the influence arm of the Chinese Communist Party in 2007"."So what is the connection to Australia? CC-3 is a Chinese-Australian citizen," Mr Hastie told parliament."He has also been a very significant donor to both of our major political parties. He has given more than $4 million since 2004. He has also donated $45 million to universities in Australia."The Australian press has reported these matters and others and have been sued for defamation by CC-3. CC-3 disputes a number of the reported allegations."The merits of these defamation cases are appropriately left for a court. My concern is that defamation cases can have a chilling effect on our free press."Mr Hastie also used his speech to accuse China of seeking to influence Western democracies."In Australia, it is clear that the Chinese Communist Party is working to covertly interfere with our media, our universities and also influence our political processes and public debates."Dr Chau has disputed previous allegations made against him.
