Labor senator Sam Dastyari has cast doubt on a Chinese media report at the heart of the furore surrounding political donations he accepted.Speaking from China this morning, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull accused Senator Dastyari of undermining Australia's foreign policy."Back home, Bill Shorten is standing up for Sam Dastyari's right to take cash from a company — associated with a foreign government — and then express a view on foreign policy that undermines the Australian Government's foreign policy," Mr Turnbull said.The Prime Minister was referring to a media report published by Chinese-Australian media organisation Media Today Group during the federal election campaign, which quoted Senator Dastyari at a media event in Sydney.He is quoted as saying: "The South China Sea is China's own affair. On this issue, Australia should remain neutral and respect China's decision." That position is at odds with government policy, which Labor supports.When asked about the statement today, Senator Dastyari said: "I'm not responsible for how the Chinese media reports my comments". "I support the position of the Labor Party on the South China Sea and all other foreign policy matters."The Senator said he does not have a recording of the event, and it appears no Australian media organisations were present.Government MPs and Senators have come out swinging to criticise Senator Dastyari, focusing their attention on his decision to bill a company with Chinese links for an overspend on travel incurred by his office.The Senator, who holds the position of Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate, has conceded he should not have asked a company with links to Beijing to cover a personal travel debt of $1,670.Cabinet minister Christopher Pyne has described the Senator as subject to "seduction", Treasurer Scott Morrison nicknamed him "Shanghai Sam" and the nation's most senior lawmaker Attorney-General George Brandis also weighed in."These were personal gifts of cash to Senator Dastyari. It's no different than if he had been given a bundle of banknotes and put them into his pocket. That conduct raises suspicion," Senator Brandis said. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten accused ministers of "hyperventilating", and rebuffed calls to sack Senator Dastyari from his frontbench."I've spoken to Mr Dastyari, he should have paid this himself and I've certainly explained to him my unhappiness with what he's done," Mr Shorten said. "He has made clear to me that he's learned his lesson."Senator Dastyari billed Top Education Institute, a company with links to China, for the travel bill incurred by his office. He also declared that Yuhu Group — a subsidiary of a state-linked operation based in China — helped settle a legal matter for him in 2014.In the same year, Senator Dastyari revealed the Australia China Relations Institute paid to cater an afternoon tea for him.Flights, accommodation and hospitality for a 15-day trip to China in 2014 were funded by the Australian Fellowship of China Guangdong Associations Incorporated. And a nine-day trip in January this year was supported by the China Australian Guangdong Chamber of Commerce Incorporated.The Government has further pointed to donated bottles of wine from Yuhu Group: two bottles of Penfolds Grange.The Senator said he donated the wine to the Exodus Foundation, an organisation to assist young people and families who are homeless. Both major political parties have received hundreds of thousands of dollars in political donations from Yuhu group.Editor's note (5/9/16): Due to a translation error the ABC previously attributed the media report mentioned in the fourth paragraph to China's official press agency Xinhua.
