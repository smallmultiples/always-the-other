Labor senator Sam Dastyari has accused Malcolm Turnbull of dialling up the attacks over his entitlement claim in order to distract from the Government's "shambles" in the Lower House last night.  On Friday morning Mr Turnbull said he had "read the riot act" to a number of senior government MPs who left the House of Representatives early on Thursday, allowing Labor to capitalise on the absentee members and win three votes on the floor of parliament. Questioned about the embarrassing chain of events, Mr Turnbull said the incident paled in comparison to the controversy involving Senator Dastyari's links to Beijing."Is the Labor party's foreign policy for sale, was this cash for comment?" Mr Turnbull asked reporters as he left Liberal headquarters in Canberra. Senator Dastyari has conceded he should not have allowed a company with links to the Chinese Government to pay a bill worth $1,670.82 incurred by his office. But the senator said the Prime Minister's accusations of buying influence were "disgraceful and offensive"."This PM is behaving like someone who is desperately trying to distract from the shambles that his Government is becoming," he said in a statement.Mr Turnbull pointed to reports of Senator Dastyari's comments in favour of China in relation to the South China Sea as evidence he may have been influenced by donations."Bill Shorten and Sam Dastyari have to explain Sam Dastyari's receipt of money from that company and the extraordinary remarks and statements he's made on foreign policy, which are, I repeat, utterly at odds with the foreign policy of the Australian Government and supported by the Opposition," he said."I reject the entire assertion that my position is any different from the Labor Party's position," Senator Dastyari responded.The Government's defeat in the House of Representatives on Thursday night almost saw the endorsement of Labor's policy for a banking royal commission.The Labor motion would not have triggered a national inquiry, but would have increased pressure on the Government over the issue.
