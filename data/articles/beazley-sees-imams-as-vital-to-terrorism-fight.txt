Federal Opposition Leader Kim Beazley has spoken passionately in favour of multiculturalism as a defence against terrorism, saying Australia's Muslim leaders are the country's best ally in the fight against religious extremism.Mr Beazley made the comments at a dinner hosted by the Chinese Australian Forum in Sydney last night.Mr Beazley says a number of terrorist organisations are targeting Australia but he says it is important the fight against terrorism does not lead to the alienation of Muslims."Making an enemy of the Islamic population serves Al Qaeda's end," he said.He says it is important to encourage and support Australian Muslim leaders who denounce terrorism."The vast bulk of the statements made from the mosques in this country are made in a strong effort to ensure that the Islamic community spurns this false cult of death and evil, and we need to appreciate that fact," he said.Mr Beazley says a tolerance of ethnic and religious diversity will bring prosperity and security to the nation.He says Australian Muslim leaders who condemn terrorism must be encouraged and supported."When they move to isolate and out extremist elements within their community and do their level best to make sure young people are not in any way attuned to a false example and a false siren song from [Osama] bin Laden and his supporters, we need to appreciate that," he said.New South Wales Premier Bob Carr and the Member for Bankstown, Tony Stewart, will meet Sydney's peak Muslim associations tomorrow as efforts continue to isolate radical fringe elements.Mr Stewart, whose electorate covers the largest Muslim community in Australia, says local Muslim leaders are horrified by the comments of radical fringe elements.Mr Stewart says it is important that the general community understands local Muslim associations do not support the extreme views being expressed."The message I'm giving them is go out there publicly, talk to people about their concerns about radical Islamic elements, condemn those elements, which they want to do, it's a matter of how they're articulated," he said.Mr Stewart says local Muslim leaders believe radical fringe elements do not have a support base and do not reflect Australian Islam."The vast majority of Muslims in Australia and certainly in my local region, are from a moderate background and they're horrified by what's occurring worldwide," he said."They're certainly horrified that Islam is being used as some sort of excuse for terrorists to rampage through our communities."
