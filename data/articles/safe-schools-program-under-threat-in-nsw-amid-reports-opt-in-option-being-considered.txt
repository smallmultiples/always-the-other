The Safe Schools program is once again under threat, with the New South Wales Parliament set to debate scrapping it this afternoon.The federally-resourced materials in the program are designed to educate students about sexual and gender diversity, but since their introduction last year there have been objections to the information they include.Liberal MP Damien Tudehope, from Epping in north-west Sydney, has presented a petition signed by 17,000 members of the Chinese-Australian community urging state Parliament to abolish the program, triggering this afternoon's debate.He claimed the vast majority of parents and mainstream Australians shared the petitioners' views.The Christian Democrats, who hold the balance of power in the Upper House, are also opposed to the Safe Schools program. There have been reports Premier Mike Baird may be considering a change requiring parents to opt in to the classes, instead of the current arrangement giving them the opportunity to withdraw their children if they object. NSW Education Minister Adrian Piccoli today said the state would continue to operate within the revised federal guidelines for the Safe Schools program, which stipulated parental consent was required.He said it was it was up to individual schools to decide whether and how to use the resources."I couldn't close that down," Mr Piccoli said."State MPs get lobbied a lot about it and I just say to people if you've got an issue with it you need to lobby your federal MP because it's hosted by them."Mr Piccoli pointed out the guidelines had been revised to address many of the original concerns.In March, the federal Minister for Education and Training Senator Simon Birmingham reiterated the Federal Government's support for the program."Tolerance should be taught in our schools and homophobia should be no more accepted than racism," he said.However, Senator Birmingham committed to amendments to the Safe Schools material, in light of a review into the appropriateness and efficacy of the resources conducted by Professor Bill Louden, Emeritus Professor of Education at the University of Western Australia.Professor Louden identified a number of shortcomings and recommended the removal of some material deemed unsuitable, along with political content or branding from any support or lobby groups that were not government-funded.The Federal Government also agreed to ensure parents could decide on the extent of participation of their school and of their own children.Mr Piccoli said it was up to the individual schools to manage the process."Everything that is in schools, however, has to be age appropriate, it has to be consistent with the curriculum, etc. All of those rules apply," he said.The state Opposition said it would argue against scrapping the Safe Schools program.Shadow Education Minister Jihad Dib also emphasised it was not a compulsory program."It's at the discretion of the schools as it stands at the moment and I'd like to think the principals are pretty sensible people and they'll make the decisions that they know are most suitable to the students," he said.Mr Dib said a blanket ban would be a mistake, but Labor was open to considering further amendments to the materials and how they were used."The overall structure of the program and the resources that are available are actually quite good and I think in terms of tightening some of the regulations around that, that's potentially the middle ground," he said."But when you start banning things, I think that's very much the wrong approach."
