The head of China's most powerful economic body has met with senior Australian ministers for high-level talks.Treasurer Joe Hockey and Trade Minister Andrew Robb met the Chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission Xu Shaoshi.They were expected to discuss the state of China's economy, and trade and investment with Australia."Chairman Xu is here for the first strategic economic dialogue between Australia and China in Australia," Mr Hockey said.The NDRC is developing the central government blueprint for China's long-term social and economic policies.The Chinese-Australian partnership will be boosted by Australia's participation in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.Mr Hockey introduced legislation to confirm Australia's involvement in the $135 billion bank.He said it would have a strong commercial focus."Its goal is not poverty alleviation or development purposes such as that of the Asian Development Bank or even the World Bank," he told Parliament."It is simply about funding the infrastructure that is going to grow the Asian economy."Mr Hockey said Australia would be the fifth largest regional shareholder of the bank, and be able to influence the bank's decisions and strategic direction.Australia will contribute $5 billion to the bank, with around $1 billion paid in capital, with the remainder able to be called upon if required.In July, the Treasurer joined representatives from 50 countries for a signing ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
