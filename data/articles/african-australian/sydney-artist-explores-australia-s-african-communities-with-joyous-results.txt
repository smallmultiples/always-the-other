As a mother of four primary-school-aged children, Louise Whelan threw in her career as a property valuer to pursue her passion for photography. It was a decision that paid dividends beyond fulfilling her own dreams, as her work celebrating the different peoples who call Australia home has been widely acclaimed.This month Customs House at Circular Quay will host a collection of portraits and documentary photography by Ms Whelan exploring the lives of the African-Australian community, which art critic Robert McFarlane describes as an "affectionate portrayal of this community and its growing confidence in both retaining an established cultural identity while enjoining the Australian community".Ms Whelan describes this as an exploration of the "third space" where immigrants lay their culture into the suburban Australian milieu creating their own form of the Australian experience.  "The visual interaction from the vibrant energy of the African colour palettes and patterns with Australian suburbia and landscape commands attention," Ms Whelan said. Growing up in West Pennant Hills, Ms Whelan had very little contact with migrants at school in the 1970s and 1980s. Ms Whelan was drawn to the African community after meeting Rwandan refugee Bahati Salima who survived the genocide to arrive in Australia 16 years ago. "I was really blown away by her optimism," Ms Whelan said."She was hopeful and resourceful and grateful." Ms Whelan can't comprehend the struggle that some of the refugees she's photographed have endured.  "I don't even have a reference point for it," she said. "I have a lot of admiration for these people." Ms Whelan treads an extraordinary line photographing this migrant and refugee community among the muted colours of grey paling fences, gum trees, and the fibro cottages of western Sydney. Through the juxtaposition of newly arrived migrants celebrating their Congolese heritage through traditional dress while bouncing on trampolines in typically Australian backyards, Ms Whelan captures the 'new Australians' doing what migrants of generations past have been through.  In Doonside Ms Whelan discovered one family living the tradition of the suit-wearing Sapeurs of the Belgian Congo, with the father sporting 80 different suits. "The idea is 'if you look good, nothing else matters'," explained Ms Whelan. "I see the bold colour and contrast in these images as a metaphor for this optimism and hope." While photographing a Harmony Day event at Cabramatta High School, Ms Whelan met a number of African children who were performing in dance and drumming groups.  "There were refugee kids from Burundi, the Congo, and the Sudan there," she said. These people recurred in Ms Whelan's work as she developed friendships with kids and photographed their extended families.  "Many of the people who I have photographed and interviewed have become part of my life," Ms Whelan explained. This level of connectedness with her subjects is apparent in Ms Whelan's photography. "Her pictures represent a conversation, a process where the character of each subject being photographed is recognised and respected," Robert Macfarlane said. Ms Whelan is currently working on an oral history of refugees for the State Library of NSW, which will be launched in March 2015.
