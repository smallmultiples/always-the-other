At 33, Catherine Gukurume is finally learning how to swim."I'm feeling so anxious. I'm excited but I'm a little bit anxious," she says while putting on her bathing cap.She holds her instructor's hand for reassurance as she takes her first tentative steps into the pool.This is the start of a long and difficult, yet essential, journey for the Zimbabwean-born mother-of-two.Ms Gukurume wants to be a police officer."It's one of the requirements of becoming a police officer and I'm very passionate about becoming a police officer," she says.Police recruits have to swim 100 metres in under four minutes to be admitted to the Victoria Police Academy.For someone who can't even float, it is a massive obstacle to achieving her dream.After a few minutes of practising with a kick-board she declares, "I'm exhausted.""But I'm hoping that through coming for the swimming lessons, I'll be able to build up the fitness level and the skill to be able to do the [100 metres] in four minutes."Ms Gukurume is one of several potential African-Australian police recruits having swimming lessons provided by Life Saving Victoria.Another is 25-year-old Mella Opiew, who came to Australia from South Sudan when he was 11."I'm not really a water friendly kinda guy — kinda used to running," Mr Opiew said.Mr Opiew has had three lessons.He is making progress, but is still a long way off the required standard."I just need to work on my breathing and my head keeps coming up, and as soon as my head comes up I just start sinking," he said.South Sudan and Zimbabwe are land-locked countries.Both Mr Opiew and Ms Gukurume had never been to a beach before arriving in Australia, and few African migrants have benefitted from the type of swimming programs common in Australian schools.This is a problem for Victoria Police.The force wants to attract recruits from all ethnic groups to better represent the state's ethnic and cultural diversity.African-Australian recruits in particular are an important target demographic for the academy, but candidates that are otherwise well-suited for the force are rejected because they cannot pass the swim test.Commander Glenn Weir, from Victoria Police's People and Development Command, said the police would never lower its admission standards to cater for different ethnic groups, and the swim test was not under review."You see often where police are involved in rescues of people in either beach or river or dam situations," Commander Weir said.Yet, outside of Water Police and the Search and Rescue Squad, Victoria Police does not know how relevant swimming is to the day-to-day operations of its uniformed officers.It has no data on how often the average police officer has to enter water in the line of duty.It could be once a year. It could be once a decade — it may be never. All the while the swimming requirement is preventing otherwise ideal recruits from its target demographic becoming police officers.Regardless, Ms Gukurume is determined to meet the swim standard required to join.She believes she has a lot to offer."If I join the police force then it puts me in a place where I can interact with some of the other African youth that are misbehaving," she said.Mr Opiew thinks it is only a matter of time before he is accepted into the academy and he believes when he passes the swim test, other South Sudanese Australians will ride on his bow wave."When I do get in they can look up to me like, 'he's got in, why can't I?'."
