When Haida Komba got her first job after migrating to Melbourne, she was paid just $20 for 10 hours work.Finding work for anyone can be tough — but worryingly some suggest it's even harder the darker your skin.Add in religious diversity and language barriers and many Victorians are facing a gargantuan task.Ms Komba, a married mother of five, moved to Australia more than 20 years ago from Comoros, near Madagascar, off Africa's east coast.She said she was ripped off in her first waitressing role."Imagine working more than 10 hours a day, only pay me $20. I just kept quiet because I thought it was right," she said.Ms Komba lives in a high-rise flat on the Flemington public housing estate, where most residents are also from Africa.She said many in the community have been unable to secure decent employment."They [employers] will judge probably because of their religion or probably for their colour," she said.These days the 37-year-old is one of the lucky ones — volunteering and study led to a position helping run community programs for Moonee Valley Council. Now the Victorian Government wants to help 150 of her neighbours find a career.It has announced $650,000 in funding to provide intensive support and training to find secure work through the first program of its type in Victoria.Industry and Employment Minister Ben Carroll said residents would be given help to apply for roles on major Government infrastructure projects like the Metro Tunnel."Housing estates right across Victoria have the highest unemployment and social disadvantage," Mr Carroll said."Our investment of $650,000 into the Flemington flats is going to change people's lives."Unemployment and a lack of direction have been cited as reasons why some young African-Australians turned to crime.Under the program, 50 school students will take part in traineeships with organisations including Victoria Police.Commander Sharon Cowden said residents will be given help to apply for the force."I would love to see more diversity within the Victorian Police and diversity in gender as well," she said. Two new dedicated employees will be based at the Flemington Community Centre to help residents find work.They will tap into existing job seeker programs run by the local council and the Brotherhood of St Laurence.The Government also wants to help residents set up 20 new businesses like cafes and laundries, and the Brotherhood's Brian Finnigan said it was ready to lend a hand."There is a great demand for this type of program and this type of partnership as well," he said.Ms Komba recently took part in the Brotherhood's own micro-business course and said her family's long-term goal was to open a restaurant showcasing Comorian cuisine."As a Comorian, we are very passionate about cooking and making a lot of food," she said.
