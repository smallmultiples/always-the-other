The Victorian Government is under attack over new laws that would give police expanded powers to prevent people as young as 14 from associating with those convicted of serious offences.The changes to existing anti-association laws would make it easier for police to prevent crime, Police Minister Lisa Neville said, by keeping convicted criminals from expanding their networks using young "clean skins".Ms Neville acknowledged they were "extraordinary powers"."We know that these sort of powers for Victoria Police can make a huge difference in disrupting crime in our state," she said.Senior police already have the ability to issue notices that ban people from associating with convicted criminals or young people convicted of offences such as aggravated burglary and carjacking.But the new rules mean nearly 2,500 more officers — from the rank of sergeant onwards — can now hand out the bans. They can also be imposed on children from the age of 14. The previous laws applied to people over 18.Ms Neville denied the laws were targeted at African-Australian youths."It's not about gangs, it's about the sort of offending that is often associated with some of those gangs and some of the networked offending we're seeing," she said.The issue of crime involving African-Australian youths has been sparked by a series of high-profile violent home invasions and carjackings in recent years.Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull last week said there were "real concerns" about Sudanese gangs in Victoria, while earlier this year Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton said Melburnians were frightened to go out to restaurants at night. The Victorian Government has denies there is a problem with any specific ethnic group.Ms Neville said the laws were a preventative measure to help police identify those at risk of offending."This is an additional tool to prevent further engagement of some of these very young people into further reoffending in the future," she said.But the Opposition's police spokesman, Edward O'Donohue, said the Government could not have it both ways. "Daniel Andrews has a different answer to this issue depending on which day of the week it is," Mr O'Donohue said."He's been saying there's no youth gang problem in Victoria and today's he's introducing legislation to deal with youth gang problems. "Which one is it? What's the story?"The laws have also been roundly criticised as being "a huge erosion of civil liberties" by the Federation of Community Legal Centres.Spokesperson Melanie Poole said the changes introduced the concept of guilt by association."[A person] can be found guilty of being a criminal, facing three years in prison, simply on the basis of who you've spent time with rather than anything you've done," she said."If you've simply associated with somebody who's previously committed a crime, whether that be through playing footy, just your online participation it even includes that … you could find yourself found guilty by association with that person."Ms Poole said the Government's assurance that the new laws would be monitored by the state's anti-corruption watchdog were not enough.She instead called for them to be scrapped."Promising to monitor the misuse of bad laws isn't good enough," she said."It's not enough to essentially admit that you know these laws are going to have devastating consequences on children and marginalised communities … and to say 'oh it's okay we'll get IBAC to monitor that'."We know that the capacity of IBAC to provide truly independent oversight is deeply questionable."The Government said the bill contained protections for vulnerable people including children, who can only be the subject of a notice if convicted of one of a limited list of serious youth crimes.
