Police are investigating after a man was beaten unconscious by a group of around 20 people and his wallet stolen following a wild brawl along the popular St Kilda foreshore in Melbourne's inner south-east. Victoria Police's Public Order Response Team was called to the area after a fight broke out between a group of young people gathered at the popular beach near at Jacka Boulevard about 10:30pm on Saturday.Acting Superintendent Mark Langhorn said the violence began after a large group of young people arrived at the beach and a brawl swiftly broke out. "It was just very quickly that the group of the African-Australians came together: there was a smaller group down there, but then [the larger group] started arriving," he said."So throughout the night no one had been down there drinking or anything like that, everyone was well-behaved, it was just when the large group came together trouble started â€¦ then it sort of flowed onto the public."Upon arrival, police used capsicum spray to disperse the crowd, before arresting a 19-year-old man on Acland Street nearby, who was charged with assaulting police, making threats to kill and breaching bail.Police said a man suffered minor injuries during the brawl, but refused medical treatment and chose not to make a statement to officers.Acting Superintendent Langhorn said shortly after police broke up the brawl, a man was beaten unconscious outside the St Kilda Life Saving Club around 11:30pm when he and his two male friends were attacked by a group of up to 20 young people."The three males were assaulted by a group of 10 to 20 youths, they are described as African-Australian youths," he said."The main victim was assaulted, he was kicked whilst he was on the ground, he was unconscious whilst he was on the ground, his phone and his wallet were stolen."His friend intervened and he received cuts and bruises to his eye, a third friend received a swollen lip from the group. Two of the males went to hospital, they were released this morning from the Alfred [Hospital]."Police earlier said the three men who were attacked were aged between 20 and 26 and were from Melbourne's eastern suburbs.Meanwhile, police arrested nine people for riotous behaviour and drug and alcohol offences at Rye, on Victoria's Mornington Peninsula.Police had stepped up their patrols in the area after two weekends of violence at parties involving schoolies, including one incident at the Rye pier where bottles were thrown at police officers, who used capsicum spray to control the crowd.Police said officers were called to reports of brawls and drunken behaviour on the Rye foreshore around 11:00pm on Saturday night.Upon arrival, officers declared the foreshore a "designated area for a weapons search" and searched 30 people for weapons, but said no arrests were made over the weapons search.Police urged those attending end-of-school celebrations to behave themselves."Those participating in schoolies are reminded to be mindful and respectful of the community and any anti-social and drunken behaviour will not be tolerated," police said in a statement.The Public Order Response Team, the police Mounted Branch and Dog Squad were involved in the patrols.
