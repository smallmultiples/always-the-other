Two women are sharing their stories of being bi-racial in Australia in the hope of spreading better understanding.Lucie Cutting said she had been asked where she was from more times than she could keep count."People often think I'm Mauritius, Islander, I've had Malaysian — I was very surprised by that," she told Tahlea Aualiitia on 936 ABC Hobart.Ms Cutting is Nigerian Australian, with a Nigerian mother and Caucasian father. She grew up in the small rural town of Yea, north-east of Melbourne."My mum was the only African person in that town and we were the only African-Australian kids in that town, which actually worked out as a kind of positive because everybody knew our family," she said.Ms Cutting said she did not really experience racism until she moved to Melbourne."It was only when I moved to the city that I actually began to experience the 'where are you from' question and racial issues," she said.She said she met people with all sorts of backgrounds and began to realise that her experience of not quite fitting into any one culture was shared."It's so nice to be able to have that moment with somebody who understands," she said.Since moving to Hobart, Ms Cutting has started working on an online project called The Pin."The Pin was created by myself and my friend Nkechi Anele," she said."We're both Nigerian Australian women who grew up in Australia."We realised there was no resource for bi-racial, bi-cultural — whatever you want to call us — Australians from Australia."The Pin website, due to launch at the end of May, will feature interviews with various bi-racial and bi-cultural Australians. As part of the project, Ms Cutting interviewed her sister who revealed she had a very different experience growing up."She's quite a lot darker [than me], she's very tall, very elegant as well. Not like me at all," Ms Cutting said."We ended up having a very intense conversation about our different experiences."My sister has experienced a lot more racism than I have ever experienced."I have strangely enough flown under the radar for the majority of my life and not experienced much."Ms Cutting said her sister had also had a tough time trying to meet the beauty standards portrayed in mainstream media."Media has been a big conversation on the site. The way media affects people," she said."We were talking with Remi, who is a young rapper in Australia."The first time he saw Faustina Agolley on TV he could not believe it because it was the first time he'd ever seen [someone that looked like him] on television."Ms Cutting said so far people had been keen to share their stories with her for the website."I think because it's something that people who are bi-racial or bi-cultural actually really struggle with, the opportunity to tell that story is really appreciated," she said."I've found younger generations, like myself, they're either conflicted or quite proud."They're either really identifying with the two sides of their identity or they're just sticking to one side of it."Ms Cutting said the mix of cultures in Australia was what made living here so great."We're a country that's always thrived on having so many cultures and so many different influences," she said."I really see us continuing on that projected path and embracing what we have here because it is what makes us Australia."It's what makes us great."The Pin website launches at the end of the month.
