In 2009 Genevieve Clay-Smith unleashed her inclusive style of filmmaking on the world winning the Tropfest Film Festival with her short film, Be My Brother.The film explored the life of a man with Down Syndrome and was lauded for breaking down social stigmas surrounding disability.Ms Clay-Smith's charity, Bus Stop Films, engaged people with a disability to fulfil roles as crew members.This work saw Ms Clay-Smith named the New South Wales Young Australian of the Year and had her in the running for the national honour."I have a real passion for helping people who are marginalised get involved in an industry that is very hard to get into," Ms Clay-Smith told 702 ABC Sydney.People living with a disability take on roles as cast and crew in a supported environment with mentorship on every Bus Stop project. The charity worked to create an inclusive environment and an opportunity for students to make a professional short film with first-hand experience of what it's like to be on a professional film set. "I love teaching and doing filmmaking workshops, making films with people from diverse marginalised communities," Ms Clay-Smith explained.I Am Emmanuel, a short film examining the challenges faced by African Australian refugees, screened internationally in 2014."Mainly I worked with the disability community, but I've just started getting involved in working in the refugee community," she said.Bus Stop aimed to teach all aspects of filmmaking, including history, theory, and the practice of filmmaking."I really love telling important stories and giving people opportunities to learn about and be involved in filmmaking," Ms Clay-Smith said.Along with her Young Australian of the Year nomination and Tropfest honours, Ms Clay-Smith was a recipient of the Westpac 100 Women of Influence Awards in 2014.Born in 1988, Ms Clay-Smith grew up in Newcastle and was educated at the Hunter School of Performing Arts in Broadmeadow, before moving to Sydney and undertaking a Master of Screen Arts at the Australian Film, Television and Radio School.Bus Stop Films' latest creation, Heartbreak and Beauty, was launched last week.The project was an experimental film devised by 12 students with a disability, using dance, poetry and visual metaphor to express how we are all connected through our shared human experiences of love and loss.The Young Australian of the Year award recipients will be announced in Canberra on Sunday, January 25.
