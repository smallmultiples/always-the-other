A teenager who kicked a police officer in the head at a Melbourne shopping centre should be jailed because it would assist his rehabilitation, a court has been told.On Boxing Day last year the 17-year-old, who cannot be identified, kicked the officer as he was arresting another youth for shoplifting at Highpoint Shopping Centre, in the city's west.The teenager pleaded guilty to intentionally causing injury and was given a nine-month probationary period, but prosecutors have appealed the decision.Crown prosecutor Jeremy McWilliams argued he should be in custody in a youth detention centre "because it facilitates, in a controlled environment, his education and participation in programs and counselling".Defence lawyer Leonard Hartnett disagreed, but said if there was to be a sentence of imprisonment it should be "a very, very short sentence"."One is heartened by the rehabilitation that my client has undertaken, the insight that he has, the remorse that he has â€” insight into why it happened," he said.During discussions about a pre-sentencing report being considered by the judge, Mr Hartnett raised concerns about it being released "in the context of a political firestorm" affecting "Sudanese men in the community".On Tuesday Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull spoke about community anxiety around "Sudanese gangs"  in Melbourne, after Immigration Minister Peter Dutton first raised the issue in January.During a hearing in June the police officer who was kicked told the court he resented being the "poster boy" for the political debate over African-Australian crime in MelbourneJustice Michael O'Connell questioned the teen's actions after he was seen in CCTV footage holding back to "deliberate or consider" when to execute the kick."I don't think it leads to a mature premeditation," Mr Hartnett responded.He pointed to the circumstances of the crime and his client's reaction to it."It was spontaneous and consistent with the reaction to the 15-year-old being taken to the ground and handcuffed," he said."It is quite unusual for a 15-year-old to be handcuffed for shoplifting a $10 to $15 item. It is remarkable that this has occurred."The court had previously heard the police officer was lucky the blow did not cause blindness.Judge O'Connell will make a ruling on the appeal next week.
