A young Sudanese-Australian woman says discussions about race and Victoria's so-called "African gang" problem, which have once again been raised following the death of her friend Laa Chol, have made her feel unsafe and question her value in society.Ms Chol, 19, died after she received serious injuries during a dispute at a party on the 56th floor of the EQ Tower on A'Beckett Street in the early hours of Saturday morning.A 17-year-old boy was charged with murder, while a 16-year-old has been charged with accessory to murder and assault.Her death led to more debate about the issue of African-Australian youth crime in Victoria, with Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton suggesting the incident was related to "gang violence".Last week Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said there was "real concern" in Melbourne about "Sudanese gangs", while earlier in the year Mr Dutton said Melburnians were afraid to go out to restaurants.A series of high-profile violent home invasions and carjackings in recent years originally sparked debate about the issue.Some Sudanese community members now say that reaction has led to widespread discrimination against Sudanese-Australians and others of African descent. Akuot Wundit knew Ms Chol when she lived in Shepparton, in northern Victoria, before the 19-year-old moved to Pakenham in Melbourne's outer south-east to study. Ms Wundit said Mr Dutton's comments and the subsequent community reaction had made her feel unsafe.She said the discussion had made it more difficult for the community to grieve Ms Chol, who was born in a Kenyan refugee camp to Sudanese parents."If she was not African, they would not link her to this gang violence stuff," she said."As a young, Sudanese person, where is my value in this country? If I was to pass away, I'd be linked to a political issue, I'd be made a topic for people to discuss."Ms Chol's death has shaken the sizable Sudanese community in Shepparton.Haroun Kafi said it had drawn ire from wider society."There is very clear discriminatory language around how the media depicts the Sudanese, but a lot of us were shocked when the Prime Minister pointed out the problem of Sudanese gangs," he said."Our morals are not different from other views in Victoria, but we have always been treated as a threat." Mr Kafi said he felt the discrimination had been highlighted as a result of the death, and was being spoken about in a way that was not representative of the wider African community.He said it was having a major impact on African families and individuals seeking work."I think discrimination generally affects people because they were always see themselves as inferior, and when they live in a community and they describe them as gangs, it creates fear, it creates fear between people," he said."It affects us as individuals, as a community and as a society." On Tuesday, close friends and community members in Shepparton remembered Ms Chol as a "funny, intelligent and caring" woman.Ms Wundit said her friend had been an aspiring lawyer with the world at her feet."She did everything with her whole heart and her support and love for people was very real, she was someone who had such a pure and good heart," Ms Wundit said."I think that's why she wanted to be a lawyer, because she hated seeing people mistreated or disrespected."A close friend of Ms Chol's family, Antonita Kuol, said she was devastated.Ms Chol had been a member of the St Paul's Lutheran Church choir in Shepparton and was a keen soccer player."Laa was a very happy young lady, everyone knew her and we are all shocked," she said.
