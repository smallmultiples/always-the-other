It's International Women's Day, and you need a soundtrack.We've got you covered.The songs here come from artists who have to something to say about women's place in the world in 2018.You'll find Camp Cope calling out gender inequality in the music industry, Courtney Barnett quoting Margaret Attwood and Stella Donnelly kicking against everyday sexism.These tracks, either brand new or recently released, are just a small sample of similar work around at the moment, and come from Australian and American artists (plus one Dutch-Iranian). All are deserving of your time and attention — on this day and any other. Courtney Barnett was writing this song, the first single from her second album, Tell Me How You Really Feel (out May 18), before the Harvey Weinstein story broke and the #metoo movement began.The lyrics in the chorus, though, including a reference to a famous Margaret Attwood quote, make the song seem much more current.I want to walk through the park in the darkMen are scared that women will laugh at themI want to walk through the park in the darkWomen are scared that men will kill themI hold my keys between my fingers.As Barnett told triple j, of the Attwood quote: "I thought it was such an interesting sentence. A really powerful way to say something so strong."I didn't realise until I watched Handmaid's Tale that Margaret Atwood had said it." On her new record In A Poem Unlimited, Meghan Remy, who fronts the Toronto band U.S. Girls, takes a pretty hard look at the treatment of women by men.In the video for Velvet 4 Sale, a police officer goes renegade after comforting a victim of domestic violence, while the song Pearly Gates wades into male entitlement and abuse.The music is vaguely disco-inspired, with a distinct pop edge, a departure from the more experimental stuff Remy released when U.S. Girls was a solo project.That seems to have broadened her audience.As Double J's Dan Condon wrote, of the new album, Remy "has a lot to say and she has an incredible way of saying it". On their second album, How To Socialise & Make Friends, out this month, Melbourne trio Camp Cope go after toxic masculinity.The Opener, the album's first single — released last year and reaching #58 in the Hottest 100 — finds it in the music business. The track skewers hypocritical venue bookers, who spout gender equality while booking all-male line-ups.Camp Cope don't just sing this stuff, they put it into action: onstage at Falls Festival, over New Years, they called out the event's organisers for the number of women on the bill."It's another man telling us we can't fill up a room," Georgia McDonald sings. "It's another man telling us to book a smaller venue." Sevda Alizadeh, who performs as Sevdaliza, was born in Iran but moved as a child to The Netherlands, where she is currently based.The 30-year-old has been making distinctive, glitchy electronic music for a few years, work that's reminiscent of FKA Twigs or Solange, in production as well as in the vulnerability of the lyrics.Hero, from the album Ison, was a pretty bare-faced exploration of motherhood — to promote the single, she commissioned a series of portraits with her mother.Alizadeh said she wanted to capture "both the vulnerability and also the terror and strength of being a mother".Human Nature is her latest single, out last month, and signals another push forward from this very inventive artist. Sydney's Exhibitionist, AKA Kirsty Tickle, has been building a profile since signing to Australian label Future Classic on the strength of early singles Hands and Motionless.Being A Woman is less dreamy and ethereal than those songs. It's also more angry:"Won't change my name or dress in white To feed your heart and be your wife My will is strong, ready to fight Don't tell me what I meant, you can't read my mind."Tickle said she wrote the song after seeing an image of a woman at the Women's March in January, 2017, holding a sign that read: 'I can't believe I still have to protest this f***ing shit." Women's World 2.0 reworks an earlier track from Zindzi Okenyo, an African-Australian hip-hop artist who also works as a theatre actor (and a Playschool host).This track features Brisbane rappers Miss Blanks and Jesswar, and feels both punchy and celebratory."Don't take no shit from a boy that should be in your shadow," Blanks raps early on. "You reign supreme."It closes with a simple refrain: "It's a woman's world." This song's from 2017, but the video, directed by Charlotte Evans, was released a few weeks ago, and it gels with the song's ethos."Mechanical Bull is dedicated to people who work in hospitality who have to deal with customers, especially drunk ones, harassing them and making objectifying comments," Donnelly said.In the song, Donnelly calls out the ways in which women working in hospitality are objectified by male customers."I'll be your darling, tits, legs, honey, sweet pea," she sings, before revoking the offer, in a turn of phrase we can't really repeat here.The video takes the power of the song and twists it towards satire, making Donnelly a less-than-impressed hospitality worker serving up mannequin limbs to some questionable customers.
