Federal Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull has refused to comment on the latest opinion poll, which shows his dissatisfaction rating is higher than his approval rating.The Nielsen poll in Fairfax newspapers shows the Prime Minister's popularity is at near-record levels at 74 per cent, while Mr Turnbull's approval rating is at 43 per cent.The Government leads the Opposition by 58 to 42 after preferences.Mr Turnbull says he is not looking at the polls, he is concentrating on keeping the pressure on Defence Minister Joel Fitzgibbon.Mr Fitzgibbon last week apologised for failing to disclose that he accepted free travel from a Chinese born businesswoman."My focus is on holding this government to account on doing everything we can to ensure that jobs are protected and Australia's safety and security is sound," he said."As part of that effort we need to have a defence minister who is competent and who can tell the truth."Mr Turnbull has been relentless in attacking Mr Fitzgibbon's relationship with Chinese-Australian businesswoman Helen Liu and the Government's links with China.But Foreign Minister Stephen Smith says Mr Turnbull's stance is contributing to his poor poll performance."We've had Mr Turnbull and some of his senior frontbenchers out there effectively beating an anti-China drum," he said."Now today we have Mr Turnbull saying that a relationship with China is very important.""No wonder the polls today are very adverse on Mr Turnbull."He says one thing on Friday, Saturday and Sunday and a different thing on Monday.Mr Turnbull has been engaged in a war of words with several ministers over the Government's relationship to China.Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner has accused Mr Turnbull of stirring up "yellow peril" sentiments but Mr Turnbull today dismissed the attack as "contemptible."
