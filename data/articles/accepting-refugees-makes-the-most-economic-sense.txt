As the Government announces it will take 12,000 additional refugees, it's worth nothing that the data shows a generous intake is likely to be the most economically sound immigration policy of all, writes Tim Dunlop.In amongst all the angst, claim and counterclaim about Australia's approach to asylum seekers - especially with the matter of the Syrian refugees in the news - we need to remember just how vital immigration has been to the success of post-war Australia.In making that case, it is important to look at the data, so let's begin with a little-reported story that captures in detail the benefits of a generous approach to immigration, and then let's look at some of the broader figures on the matter.A recent report by settlement agency AMES written in conjunction with Deloitte Access Economics notes the ongoing success of a program that resettled a group of Karen refugees in the town of Nhill in north-western Victoria.The Karen people are a diverse group who live mainly in south and south-eastern Burma. They have often been the subject of ethnic violence and other ongoing forms of persecution.Since 2010, 160 Karen have resettled in Nhill as part of a government program to move refugees into rural areas.The report notes that Nhill itself is a "conservative community" and that at the time it was suffering from "a declining working-age population, which has had flow-on implications for the economic and social prosperity of the town".The main employer in the area was (and is) the Luv-A-Duc food processing centre and it was having trouble getting staff for a mooted expansion. The report says "Luv-a-Duck management identified the Karen as potential employees".The scheme has been incredibly successful:Through a staged recruitment and resettlement process, the Karen community now comprises approximately 10% of the Nhill population, including significant numbers of working age adults and families with young children....A total of 70.5 Full Time Equivalent (FTE) positions have been added to the regional economy over the five year period of analysis, representing approximately 3% of total employment across Hindmarsh.The economic impact of this increased labour supply, in terms of Gross Regional Product - as modelled by Deloitte Access Economics, is estimated to be $41.5 million in net present value terms.The wider benefits to the town are also worth noting. The CEO of the Shire Council has said:The social impact of the Karen settlement is extraordinary. Nhill has embraced and opened their minds and hearts to the Karen. This has made Nhill a better place to live.What really stands out in the report, though, is how important it is to have strong political and community leadership, and how important it is to work with, and honestly explain to locals the way such a scheme is designed to work.The report notes:While critical, employment is not of itself sufficient for successful resettlement and a number of other contributing factors have been identified.These include:• strong leadership in the host community;• a host community which is well prepared for the new settlers;• initial accommodation for the new arrivals;• support for the new families;• management of the degree and complexity of "cultural adjustment" on both sides;• strong leadership in the settling community; and,• potential settlers prepared for the new environment;In case it wasn't already blindingly obvious, then, this is in part why calls by members of the Abbott Government for Australia to offer sanctuary only to Christians from Syria are not only offensive to liberal values of decency and equality, but also likely to be counterproductive.Such discrimination simply isn't necessary and calls for it are the opposite of the sort of leadership that is needed. (In case you are wondering, the "majority of Karens are Theravada Buddhists who also practice animism, while approximately 35 per cent are Christian.") And although the example of Nhill might be a relatively small case, we should remember that it is really just a microcosm of a much bigger project, one that goes by the name of post-war Australia: Nhill is Australia writ small.The bigots who want to limit refuge to Christians conveniently forget how successful our post-war, non-discriminatory immigration policies have been. Yes, they will yelp about how "generous" we are, but their next breath is always about finding ways of limiting that "generosity".But that is likely to be exactly the wrong approach.Part of the problem is we have surprisingly little data about the economic effects of humanitarian immigration to really be able to make informed decisions.As a Business Insider article noted recently, "Comprehensive, long-term statistical data on the economic contribution of refugees and migrants is non-existent."But this is starting to change. The Australian Bureau of Statistics recently released a study that begins to address this data deficit. And what the report shows is that, far from being a burden on the country, humanitarian migrants in particular are amongst our most successful:...While almost two-thirds of migrant taxpayers were migrants with a Skilled visa - reporting $26 billion in Employee income - Humanitarian migrants displayed greater entrepreneurial qualities and reported a higher proportion of income from their own unincorporated businesses and this income increased sharply after five years of residency. (Emphasis added.)Think about that the next time someone says we need to lock up more asylum seekers in offshore detention centres. (Or some ill-informed backbencher tweets somethings like this.)Indeed, as Daniel Webb, director of the Human Rights Law Centre has said:We're currently spending $1 billion a year detaining asylum seekers offshore. That's more than five times the United Nations refugee agency's entire budget for all of South-East Asia.It's utterly crazy.Given the ABS figures - and going beyond basic humanitarian considerations - consider what an absolute waste of money such detention is and what potential benefits await us if instead of locking people away to rot, we allowed them to live out their potential.It might be bad news for those who want to keep asylum seekers out for other reasons, but let's be clear: the data shows that a generous immigration policy is likely to be the most economically sound immigration policy.Tim Dunlop is the author of The New Front Page: New Media and the Rise of the Audience.

Comments for this story are closed.09 Sep 2015 4:35:44pmProbably wasting my time raising this - no doubt bureaucrats always seem to know better, but it makes sense to me that towns like Nhill (Katanning here in WA is another with migrant connections you wouldn't expect if you didn't know your history) get involved in the process early whilst it's still in the selecting phase.I understand one of the problems you tend to get is people clustering in cities because they have others of their particular make-up there to draw support from (and even just to have a natter in their own language).If, when they're at the stage of getting ready to come to Australia they could in essence be aware of what towns had "bid" for them, and who else was coming, and see if they could self-form a group of families who could get on with each other and were prepared to commit to the town they'd chosen after getting whatever guff was available on each.It strikes me having this thing work right needs those coming to know as much about potential places on offer BEFORE we have the overblown ceremony at the airport.It also makes sense if communities in Australia decide for themselves how many newcomers they think they could absorb and make a request to the central authorities rather than what seems to be the case of the feds acting without sufficient input from the final destinations. It wouldn't surprise me to find out that if you asked for "situation vacant" ads from rural towns and shires you'd find out 12,000 wouldn't cover it.And, as a regular Abbott-basher on this site let me thank the Prime Minister for his announcement (the non-bombing bit). I'll take you at your word sir, but do need to mention you have a track record of screwing-up the few good things you've been able to launch. So, unless or until any nastiness, duplicity, or incompetence surface, well done Tony.

09 Sep 2015 4:55:23pmOne way the Libs are likely to screw this initiative up is by arguing that by allowing large family groups, or groups of acquaintances, or groups of refugees coming from the same original town, to end up in the same place is a recipe for the creation "ghettos", where the idea is that they should "integrate". Hence, they are likely to be scattered all around the place.I hope they don't make this mistake. Having a backup community to rely on in case of emergency is extremely important, especially for the first generation. Subsequent generations tend to disperse more, as they do not need the specific support of members of the same ethnic group.

09 Sep 2015 6:39:00pmThe Libs have certainly made this mistake before with Malcom Frasers's foolish and very naive 'Lebanese Concession'.

This happened with the resettlement of Sudanese refugees in Perth who were from opposite sides of the conflict in Sudan, but settled within a few streets of each other ... end result was machete fights in the street.The issue requires both compassion and understanding of the different ethnic backgrounds in a particular country of origin and the history of the issues in country of origin which have caused the people to flee persecution.  If you don't get this right, you just transfer the conflict here (albeit on a smaller scale).

09 Sep 2015 5:34:14pmNice comments Son of Zacy, I too (as another regular Abbott basher) would like to congratulate Mr Abbott on this decision. I too have doubts about the bombing mission but credit where credit is due, the 12,000 new places and increased funding is a good thing. I also congratulate Mr Shorten for his words today where he could have easily played politics when asked about whether he thought Abbotts hand was being forced. He said he did not care how the decision was made as long as it was made. Commendable indeed by both men.

10 Sep 2015 11:14:52amMost likely travel here on commercial flights upon being processed by UNHCR officials in Europe and Turkey.That is how most refugees actually come to Australia. On a commercial flight once their claim for asylum has been processed, usually in a refugee camp relatively close to where they were fleeing.  Generally an Australian government employee flies overseas to assist with the move and accompanies the group to Australia, assists them with customs and immigration procedures at the airport and then off to their home that they'll live in.

09 Sep 2015 6:08:20pmI am in agreement with you, Son of Zaky. Although the author assumes that everybody arguing against boat people are somehow xenophobes secretly plotting to bring back white Australia (even though I am far from being white myself), I welcome genuine refugees that have been granted safety by our government at their time of need, including this lot. To many like myself, it's not about WHO is let into the country, but rather how. I can't agree with those who disregard our rules, destroy their documents to incriminate their actual origin, while placing themselves in risky and dangerous situations and even result to self harm to get what they want. On the other side of the spectrum, like most Australians, I am more than welcoming to war weary Syrians with actual documentation and identification having a place here and being granted access by our government.

10 Sep 2015 4:50:27pmIronically, it is often the "Who" that these so-called studies of the hypothetical economic benefits of receiving the current influx of refugees tend to be very indirect about- including this article.Let's be frank- for such a study to be valid in this context, it would need to investigate the short-and-long-term economic impact of receiving Islamic refugees from the Middle East and Africa. Instead, most studies try to study a completely different group (non-refugee migrants, net-migrant/refugee as a whole, or a completely different cultural demographic of refugees- usually Christians and Buddhists from Europe or South-East Asia) and attempt to project these findings on a completely different context.And they become surprised why nobody is won over by the 'economic' argument.

09 Sep 2015 7:47:30pmAll 12 000 will be in Melbourne, perhaps Sydney, like most other NESB migrants: country towns don't have the family links or services to sustain such large numbers. I suspect the main consideration might be to ask the refugees where they might feel most comfortable: most Australians hate country towns - or at least think life is better away from them - so it would be hardly surprising if they'd too.

10 Sep 2015 3:32:26pmyou missed the point: once they are given refugee status, they can be given housing in any particular place, but they do not have to take it.  As far as I know, we do not impose movement restrictions on refugees.The time to be discouraging towards refugees ends once they are given resettlement.  From this point onwards, it is about service provision and inducements, not orders, as to what they can do.

10 Sep 2015 8:05:45amMost Australians have never crossed the Great Dividing Range to see what country Australia is like.They stick to the city and coastal fringe and go to Bali for their hols.Son of Zaky is correct in his opinion of the availability of jobs as well as the stoic ability of country people to integrate strangers.Those strangers may need to be fourth generation to actually be considered locals but they will be welcome and involved in work and social events.Country towns actually have integrated community events usually centred around the school community or the local pub or club.Unlike the cities where communities can be isolated into racial minority groups.The one limiting factor will be water security but the country regions do have large dams in some locations.In NSW Wellington has a large dam and also Cowra.The New England area is also lovely. The Granite Belt wine area is crying out for workers and new businesses in specialty food production for the growing number of Brisbane people taking a weekend break. These towns are not even far from the coast certainly not on the boundless plains our National Anthem promises. Those boundless Plains is exactly where many new immigrants need to be encouraged to at least try out for a new life.

10 Sep 2015 11:20:10amKatanning in WA was home to thousands of migrants.Helped to develop the meat processing facilities and businesses in that town by (dare I say it) providing lots of Muslim (mainly Malay/Christmas Island to begin with) workers who could produce Halal meat for export to South East Asia and for the domestic market.Without the migrant workers, the town would not likely exist today.

10 Sep 2015 2:18:14pmGreat (I was just adding to your points).  Many large rural towns/cities have more than a dam - they have rivers.  These days I do believe newcomers become locals after much less than the quoted 25 years when I treechanged 40 years ago and more likely as soon as one has children and they go to school.  New arrivals have greatly increased and enhanced living and locals have risen to the occasion.  One hundred year old wineries are thriving and alongside have come many cherished new enterprises in the food and hospitality areas.  It's bloody lovely.

10 Sep 2015 3:17:21pmHear, hear.I grew up in a country town in NSW that has a 25% Italian population, and which (as part of a government irrigation scheme) was pioneered and built by a veritable United Nations of citizens - Norwegians, Lithuanians, Germans, Chinese, Australian Aboriginal, Greek, Albanian, Afghan and so on, as well as plenty of Scots and Irish.  More recently, over the last couple of decades, the town has peacefully welcomed and accommodated significant populations of Indian, Pacific Islander and Sudanese people. As a city dweller now, it always amuses me to hear impeccably lefty urbanites slinging off against supposedly redneck country Australia, when most of them are white-bread ex-private school kids who would barely have even met a person from a non-Anglo background, apart from those who serve them in ethnic restaurants.

He spent three years in a seminary, and has difficulty in accepting that there are others that do not share his belief because they were brought up in a different world. His efforts now will be to see that the Muslim intake is kept to a minimum.If all of these efforts were put to ensuring that the Muslim community were assimilated into the broader community without rancour it may be more fruitful. Disruptive clerics may not get a look in then.When Abbott has to "Wait and see" you know that he is not perusing his natural instincts.

10 Sep 2015 3:21:35pmG'day Jean.In my humble opinion, Australia is already over-populated & should immediately develop a Population Policy to get some idea of what numbers might be sustainable.  If it turns out that we're already in ecological deficit, then immigration numbers should never exceed emigration numbers from the previous year.  As to whether those immigrants are refugees or not, I'd leave that up to the government of the day.Humans appear to be in plague.

Taken globally, the total fertility rate at replacement is 2.33 children per woman.

09 Sep 2015 6:24:30pmUmm, that white boy IS Syrian. You see while Syrians are considered to be 'Arabs', a big portion of its population are people's from Semitic backgrounds, with splatterings of Mongol (after the Mongol invasions), but also Turkmen, Kurds, and also Jewish communities (I'm talking about ethnicities here not so much religious adherence), and also a fair bit of Greek blood runs through the region for obvious reasons. As an example Kind David from biblical times was Semitic and was ochre skinned (if your skin is ochre red you have some very old genetic make up indeed) with red hair. Many Jews are Semitic, so in Syria you run the gamut of red heads, blondes, jet black hair, light skin, dark skin, red ochre skin colourings, brown eyes, blue, green etc and obviously Arab tendencies. The Syrian people themselves have a very long and dynamic history. The Assyrians were once a world superpower, and I don't think the power of the Babylonians who came along later needs explaining. In other words both empires dominated their region for vast periods of time conquering many different people, creeds and tongues. One of the features of the Babylonian empire was its willingness to allow conquered people to maintain their culture and religion, in much the same way the Romans did. This meant that many foreign people and cultures, along with their genetic make up and all that entails, stayed in the region and made their lives there. This obviously impacted in an enormous way the current variety of appearances evident in modern day Syrians. So is it a surprise that the picture highlights a little boy who appears to be fair skinned? Nope. Not if you know just a tiny bit of history.

A softly softly approach to xenophobia is still xenophobia, and such an approach is simply trying to curry favour with electors by underhand means.It is too late now to decide that it was a mistake to allow Muslims to  migrate here, and the vast majority now  call themselves proud Australians, and despise the "Death cult" as mush as Abbott does.I was born in the days of "King and Country" and was proudly pro British.

10 Sep 2015 8:40:50amNot true. The principle of freakonomics applies. For example if an oil tanker crashes on the barrier reef and spills oil everywhere it's good for the economy as additional workers and materals need to be purchsed to rectify the situation. Effectively an increase in GDP.Similarly all the jobs and materials required to facilitate the acceptance of these refugees benefit working Australians and small buisnesses.Which proposes quite a conundrum for those on the right who claim to be all about the economy. If that was true they'd be tripping over themselves to take more people. But then free markets are not free and small government is not small. But who am I to inject logic into conservative reality.

10 Sep 2015 2:08:26pmHi HomerThe political landscape with regards to immigration more broadly is quite fascinating if we look at it through actions rather than rhetoric.All parties support mass immigration. The liberals and labor support skilled migration for the economic reasons you outline (the never ending growth model) whilst the greens support seemingly unlimited refugee intake. All parties seem content with a high population Australia. I expect the liberal party would welcome mass unskilled migration too if it wasn't an electorally prickly subject. The big corps love it.Labor, however, should be opposed to mass migration of both skilled and unskilled types due to the increasing labour pool and the downward pressure on wages it causes. But apparently not apart from a bit of rhetoric about potential Chinese 457 visa holders.As for the greens, they should be opposed to all migration due to their roots as ecological conservatives. But no, they would rather relocate the noble 3rd world to Australia than conserve the environment. It's ok to ruin the environment on large housing estates as our cities stretch further inland but not on a mine. Go figure (I cant). For my part, I've yet to hear any of them explain why never ending growth and a huge population benefits the current inhabitants of Australia. Actual people, not numbers on a spreadsheet.

They are being protected now and will be looked after, but as to whether Germans will tolerate such a seismic shift in their demography (potentially a few million Syrians) becoming a permanent fixture) is yet to be seen. Already, becoming a German citizen is no easy feat, so while the Germans are to be commended for their generosity, being granted asylum is not necessarily a guarantee of permanency.

09 Sep 2015 5:36:18pmG'day Gordon.New population certainly stimulates economic activity, but it also requires additional infrastructure & services, puts stress on wild-life habitats, increases pollution & puts Australia further into environmental & ecological deficit.That said, an additional 12,000 is neither here nor there, so welcome to the proposed new arrivals.  They'll be arriving with the blessing of our elected representatives, so they'll get my blessing also (for what it's worth).Regards,Cobber

09 Sep 2015 6:04:36pmG'day Keith.I think both you and Tory Boy below (and anyone else who wanders down the same path) need to occasionally think outside the box (aka the city) a bit more.As someone who is very fortunate to be able to spend a nice slice of time in the remoter parts of WA I can assure you that it is indeed possible to place people in areas that are currently dying a slow and protracted death without any of the issues you raise.Unfortunately (and I'm not putting you in this category), too many join this debate with thinly-disguised xenophobia (and I know it's okay to use that term, because our current government is bandying it around a fair bit at present) and rely on the "clogging up our cities", "on welfare", and "don't add anything" mantras when even a cursory glance at what is being said outside of metropolitan areas would tell you it (targeted refugee placements) would be welcomed.As I've written above, if you asked rural shires and towns what they think they could handle (and not are all alike - some are progressive but terribly underpopulated for what they do, some simply aren't of a type that could make it work, and some are just populated or controlled by hopeless hillbillies who have to go extinct first before their towns can attempt to save themselves from the same fate), you may find that city people sitting around snarling about reffos may not be the best people to be speaking on behalf of the bulk of the landmass and those people trying to get on with things who live there.This really is a debate where city people - just for once, if they can manage it - to shut the hell up and listen to those other Australians they're claiming to speak for.

09 Sep 2015 6:16:41pmIf towns are dying a slow death it would be because they have outlived their usefulness surely?  Why banish people to these remote places to keep the towns alive when there is nothing there for the new arrivals?  Jobs would be in short supply.  Suggest you think about the issues a bit more.

10 Sep 2015 2:33:51pmStating the obvious.A city indeed has a population.
Alert moderator
10 Sep 2015 9:55:28amMost country towns that die generally die because the population in the area that the services the town provides dwindles to a level which makes the provision of those services unviable.  Generally this is caused by farm consolidation as many towns were formed in the early 20th century as rural areas were opened up to returned soldiers.  Many towns such as Bruce in the upper mid north of SA were viable until extended droughts caused the farms to fail and the prevailing agricultural techniques were not up to dealing with reduced rainfall.On the Eyre Peninsula, rural towns servicing the farming areas have had large population drops from peaks in the early 80's.  This is due to many younger people leaving to find employment away from the rural areas and the consolidation of farms to best exploit economies of scale using larger farm machinery.  In the past before the 80's and 90's, a farm needed the farmer and a small team of workers or share farmers.  Nowadays, farmers use labour saving machinery, much of which is now provided by local contractors.  In the past there would be a farmer doing the harvesting for up to 18 -20 hours a day on his header, now many have 2-4 headers run by contractors going to reap at the most optimum time to maximise protein levels in the grain which brings in better prices.

10 Sep 2015 10:17:33amSadly, you are wrong, the figure published is actually 94.5%. And of the particular group you are referring to over 90% do not have basic English after 5 years. But the issue I think is not how many aslyum seekers or where they are from, but the lack of any political will to integrate them, instead encouraging them to live alone, in ghetto's, celebrating their unique cultural diversity and identity. It is pretty sad - and confronting - to walk though my suburban mall and see scores of working age men sitting around, getting drunk or high and seething with frustration.

09 Sep 2015 4:54:23pmI have read many of the 'reports' into the economic benefits of migrants generally (at best no net benefit, and usually fails to count things like the costs of congestion and other indirect costs), and tried to find things about refugees.  Most of these reports are self-serving puff pieces from refugee advocate groups that tend to count the benefits but always fail to add up the costs.  Those that do look at the economic benefits of refugees lump in the incredible economic success of one key refugee group: post-war Ashkenazi Jews: Richard / Anthony Pratt, Frank Lowe, Harry Triguboff, John Gandel - all from an ethnic group which comprised 5 out of the 10 richest families in Australia in 2014.The rest?  Vietnamese were middle class overwhelmingly, hence their need and capacity to flee Vietnam, and subsequently did well.  But much worse performance is evident  in most of the rest:  Sudanese, Afghani especially do very badly economically.So to base an article saying there is economic benefit for refugees in the absence of any real evidence just invites scorn:  critics will rightly shout that if a friend of refugees can offer no evidence of their benefits, then there must be none.

09 Sep 2015 10:35:54pmI would argue the biggest difference is opportunities for low skilled work, especially for those from a non-english speaking background. The jobs (e.g. assembly line worker) where a little bit of on the job training can teach you how to do the job are rapidly disappearing. Just the health & safety aspects require a reasonable level of english.One might hold hope for the kids, but our rapidly deteriorating public education system makes that path more challenging.

09 Sep 2015 4:56:08pmThe assimilation and integration of the Karen people in Nhill is obviously a successful example, and it warms my heart. A relevant point too is that they are Bhuddists. I do not read every day in the media of Karen Bhuddists cutting people's heads off, burning them alive, executing them by dynamite, pushing gays off tall buildings, raping young girls and women of different cultures and religions. I do not read of Karen teenagers trying their damndest to go and fight for an organisation that commits atrocious acts of cruelty and inhumanity, apparently because they don't have a job in Australia, or something! I have seen no news reports of Karens, or Timorese or even Kosovans trying to leave Australia to go and join a war where one sect sends young girls as suicide bombers into the mosques of the other sect. I do read about Muslims in Australia demanding Sharia law and killing customers at a coffee shop and threatening to rape a journalist and sending disgraceful letters to the families of deceased servicemen and women and so on. So, I wonder why it is seen as so awful to suggest that we don't let an influx of Muslims into Australia? Surely there is some considerable merit and indeed good sense to admit those who have been so sorely discriminated against to the point of genocide. The argument that 'the majority of Muslims are peaceful and innocent citizens' doesn't wash, to be honest. The men and women from the Muslim community who have gone, or have tried to go, to serve the murderous beasts of ISIS came from that 'peaceful and innocent' citizenry. W have every right to be suspicious and concerned about growing that community.

09 Sep 2015 6:58:45pmThanks for the article. well done.Good to see Abbott do something sensible for once, though I have mixed feelings about bombing IS in Syria.. I think these traumatised Syrian refugees will be great for Australia. Perhaps we could have even taken a few more.While I can understand some of the apprehension about muslims, I think such fears are overblown. Despite and not because of, politically motivated laws such as RDA18C and the Vic RRTA 2001, Australian muslims are generally excellent citizens. Australian muslims behaved admirably both during and after the Martin place seige. I was very impressed by the Syrians speaking their minds on "Insight" a while ago, especially taking into account the strong feelings and opposing views many had.My own family contained a rather fanatical Sinn Fein member about a century ago. When he migrated here ca. 1910 to live with my great-grand father's family, he foolishly attempted to carry on with his bitter, violent politics. My ancestor (his brother), told him very emphatically that he was now in Australia and he'd better behave himself if he wanted to continue living with his relatives. (He did and he did). I expect this sort of thing might also happen in some migrant families. Most will probably just be very grateful and relieved to live in our peaceful land and will work very hard.Have a good one.

09 Sep 2015 8:17:37pmWhile the majority of Karen people are Bhuddist, the Karen people that have been accepted into Australia are from the 35% Christians, except Australia  has selected 80% Christian Karens. The article is misrepresenting what we've settled in Australia- inplying it was Bhuddists in the main. Fact is the US have done much the same as 90% of their Karen population are Christians. For some time there have been petitions by the Karen-presume mostly the 20% Bhuddists asking that Au become more inclusive in selection to allow more of the Bhuddists to be selected. You'd think Tim Dunlop would have done his homework- and more comment responders too. Tim has inadvertantly just supported the process of selection  by most similar religion. He used the Karen for showing how success their intake and settlement was.Yes, Au selected 80% largely by religion-Christian!  Plus the Christian Karens were far more British influenced.I agree with your general view in Bhuddist being less  prone to justifying violence, it's not sanctioned by their religion, though they have been brutal enough when circumstances frazzle them, more as human nature rather than the potential contained in muslim fanatism/fundamentalism.Furthermore, Bhuddists in Australia never seem to create issues, blending inconspiciously in Au society.

The reality of course is that country towns are dying with no employment opportunities, and whenever a possible opportunity appears, like say a new coal mine in the area, there is always skink or a bellfrog or an ancient burial site, and a bunch of traumatised environmentalists who ensure the town continues to decay away and more people just give up and move to the cities.

09 Sep 2015 4:58:52pmThank you for a positive story, which I recall seeing something on tv a month or two ago about what I assume is this showcase Karen settlement.  Every rose has its thorn.  I have the utmost respect for Theravada Buddhism, and can't think of a more suitable mindset I know from experience to tolerate change and adapt smoothly if left in peace.  I know Burmese Buddhists from overseas who manage to get by okay as second-class citizens, and they're tough as nails and kindhearted friendly welcoming kinds of people as long as you give them a little r.e.s.p.e.c.t.Now, onto the rose.  Christians only? Is that what they 'really' mean, or is there a more targetted demographic thornthat political correctness doesn't want to talk about directly?    With regards economic sense, it's relevant of course.  It is a bit heartless but that's life.  It's also perhaps in my opinion perhaps a little short-term and narrowly costed.  Buddhists are not all that common in Syria from what I've been reading and watching on tv.  There is a Cronulla flavour which needs tempering with a little salt on the bread, because Buddhists are easy to get along with compared to Christians and people like me..

My father and I have discussed this very matter since the 1990's; shaking our heads in wonder why any of our elected Federal Govt would not consider boosting our population with refugee placements into our remote or smaller rural communities struggling for economic survival. It is proven for more than a hundred years since WW1 internationally, yet to this day we still cannot get our politicians to see the light on this. Let's hope further interest is generated by articles such as this.

09 Sep 2015 6:40:04pmYes, it makes a very valuable point:  we can achieve a win-win solution. And that is a common meeting point that both sides of the debate should be meeting at.  A refugee intake that Australia can productively absorb. And instead of just throwing numbers in the air, we can debate the finer points of an econometric model. Unfortunately, such a dry approach does give the emotional kick that our politicians and other extremists are addicted to (and they may not have the competence to understand such models either).

They are also a lot more likely to be able to successfully integrate into the Australian community. Muslims on the other hand are a different kettle of fish- look at Europe and how they are destroying the social fabric of society!

09 Sep 2015 5:07:00pmIt's all well and good referring to the great outcomes achieved through the arrival of the Karen people in rural Victoria, but the article would have been more powerful had it addressed the more disturbing outcomes in regard to refugees from Afghanistan and Iraq - large majorities are still reliant on welfare many years after arrival. Whether we like it or not, refugees are not some homogenous group of people and Australia would do well to consider the statistsics on successful integration before signing up to large numbers. There are also few unskilled jobs left in Australia - where will those with few skills work, or are we happy to consign them to welfare once they arrive? Given our commitment to resettlement will never cater to the almost unlimited demand for places, refugee needs (ie risk of danger) and likelihood of successful integration are factors that require consideration, unless of course your part of the 'let everyone in' brigade with its inherent naivety and inability to understand the concept of unintended consequences.

09 Sep 2015 5:08:11pmThe way we treat asylum seekers is abhorrent, but where are the alternatives being actively canvassed?  I have my own, and quite possibly, naive solution: instead of turning back the boats, let them come, place all asylum seekers on board into onshore detention pending expeditious processing, and swap them with other countries' intakes.  That way, 'boat people' won't be settled in Australia (which will appease the conservatives), genuine asylum seekers will go to a safe, new country (which will please humanitarians), and Australia continues to take assist through intake numbers (which will please the economists).  If we pay a fraction of that $1 billion to fund processing centres in south East Asia, we might be able to stop the boats after all, in reality, not just rhetoric... And help needy people.  Desperate people will not stop fleeing baddies, just because there are good people acting like baddies in front of them.

09 Sep 2015 5:09:48pm"And what the report shows is that, far from being a burden on the country, humanitarian migrants in particular are amongst our most successful"I don't know what the report shows, but the quote underneath this shows nothing of the sort.It says that humanitarian arrivals set up more small businesses and that after five years they make more money than they did in the first.What it probably reflects is that these arrivals cannot get jobs due to lack of skills or language difficulties and so set up small businesses in their own communities, exacerbating the "ghetto" complex that is so natural and so hard to eradicate.  What they actually do is recycle social security payments.The only figure provided is the $26 billion in wages for the skilled migrants. I suspect it is far greater than the income of the non-skilled.The rest of the story is just puff.  A small town where every claims to be happy.  A Shire CEO that extols the local economy.Is this what passes for journalism?  Getting a report from a resettlement agency and repeating it verbatim?Another case of a well meaning journalist trying to find a story to suit his own political beliefs.I can nominate a few local suburbs full of humanitarian arrivals and suggest the reporter do some research there.I would suggest that he not go at night, and that if going by day to keep a sharp lookout.  They do not like visitors and make that quite obvious.  Even the police tend to go in numbers.Before the "racist, racist" chant starts, it has nothing to do with race.  It is taking people from a completely different culture and leading them to expect that they will get everything they want for nothing.  A bit like what is going on in the outback.  It creates an particularly nasty sort of cargo cult mentality, made worse when told they should not adapt but remain different.You end up with aggressive youths on the streets and an exodus of the locals.  But a wonderfully diverse suburb.  And that is what counts.

09 Sep 2015 5:15:38pmWow,That has quite possibly got to be the thinnest argument I've seen on the Drum yet.Quoting an anecdotal case over a small group of refugees and a sentence out of an ABS report (that doesn't actual say what the author thinks it does) and extrapolating that to support a massive increase in refugee intake for economic reasons?If you want to make the economic argument, you'll have to do a lot more than this.

09 Sep 2015 5:16:30pmWhat 20,00?  I thought Abbott was keeping the Syrian migrant intake within his total annual migrant intake, which is higher proportionally than any other western country.  If he loses control of immigration he's finished, because that's all he had going for him.
Alert moderator
10 Sep 2015 7:28:40amAbbott is on thin ice. All he had going for him was that he stopped the boats and got rid of the carbon tax. But he is still allowing in hundreds of thousands of unwanted and unneeded immigrants and now he is bringing in Syrians at a vast cost. If only we could get that kind of money spent on setting up Aussies in life.

The statement that "persecuted minorities" will be preferenced indicates there will be a measure of discrimination employed, which is more than simply unfortunate, as it is likely to further marginalise and support the demonisation of a segment of the population that amounts to about 2% of the total, but that a vocal proportion well in excess of that seem to fear exceedingly.

09 Sep 2015 5:25:35pmWhen Labor called for an increase in aid for Syrian refugees only a few weeks ago, the Abbott government accused Labor of wanting to fund a "terrorist picnic". Now the Abbott crew are handing over $44 million for Syrian refugees without any mention of a "terrorist picnic". This is usual for the Abbott government. Now Abbott is pretending that his government is "moving quickly" while displaying their racist colours by declaring that only "christians" are to be helped. The backflip on this one is still in progress. Abbott devalues the Office of Prime Minister and shames Australia as a nation.

09 Sep 2015 7:41:11pmPretty close to the mark there Darren, I can see it all now, just before Christmas, the first of the refugees arriving will be met at the airport, where a massive contingent of TV crews and reporters will be reporting the compassion shown by the Liberal government, who are now worthy of re election.

09 Sep 2015 5:25:40pmAbbott's statement was that 'there would be 'an extra 12,000 refugee intake, rising from 13,750 this year to 17,750 in 3years' )The ABC reported it as '12,000 additional places making this years intake 26,750', but it is not what my earworm heard (and unfortunately my internet speed cannot handle video well- I got the first few minutes-the rest from actual ABC24 press conference).On a journo's enquiry, as to whether the '12,750 would make this years intake 26,750, Abbott's response was to reiterate that this years intake is 13,750 rising to 17,750 next year,..........rising to 26750 in 2018. (......Sorry can't remember exact number Abbott gave for 2017)To me, this sounds too much like a budgets four year forward estimates, where much money is to be spent, but most of it backended (eg Swan's Gonski,  Hockey's 2015 Child care ~$5m).Not confirming the journalist prompting, Abbott dodged the question, giving an oblique response.I hope this refugee intake is not backended.I hope I heard incorrectly, but I wasn't reading DRUM articles at the time and he had my full attention.
Alert moderator
09 Sep 2015 5:40:17pmTim Dunlop is unable to differentiate between a migrant coming to Australia and asylum seekers.  In all cases the migrant is expected to pull their weight and contribute to society (an unusual concept for the Left I agree), while the asylum-seeker will end up like most of them and still be CentreLink clients decades after they have arrived.So, in an economic sense taking asylum-seekers is usually good money being wasted, depending mostly on where they originate from.  Although it still gives some an opportunity to parade their vanity on a wider stage while making the rest of us pick up the tab.  However, I don't see that as being much of a return on investment either.

09 Sep 2015 5:45:21pmI didn't know there were plans to spread the refugees through small rural towns with a shortage of unskilled labour. It hardly seems fair on the skilled workers, but I suppose many might consider it a reasonable exchange for long term security.

09 Sep 2015 5:58:58pmWhile I'm entirely in favour of Australia having growing population through natural growth and migration for long term economic and political reasons, and the plan cited in your Karen example of settling migrants in rural areas adds to the appeal of the use of migrants to grow the population by decentralising the population from the capital cities. I'd actually like to see a pilot program set up to test this on a larger scale, preferably in Tasmania in my opinion due to its long term economic sluggishness and currently minuscule population (just a tad over half a million, seriously McDonald's employs almost 4 times as many people as that) and if their population does grow large enough they may not need shipping subsidies across Bass Strait. If it works there, I'd seriously want to look into the possibility of doing it Australia wide. Because if it's and economic gain to welcome these people, what's the down side?As for people who say Australia is full or overpopulated I'd say we're the 3rd least densely populated country on Earth, growing regional population wouldn't strain the infrastructure of our capital cities, we have renewable water resources equivalent to 96% the UK, France and Germany combined (whose total population is over 200 million) according to the CIA World Factbook.

09 Sep 2015 6:48:57pmI just wrote this as a response to someone who was afraid these refugees would force Australian's onto the streets and take away their jobs."That is the problem, when narrow minded persons like yourself tell untruths and lies, i believe right at this moment there is an article on the Drum that says how taking in extra refugees at this time will actually help Australia economically, our population is ageing fast, we need more hard working people int he community to drive the economy, who pay taxes so that we can afford the health costs as our population ages, who are these terrorists you speak off? We make terrorists, like we did when we bombed the hell out of iraq and upset the delicate balance of the region. You calculated racist criticism of everything muslim is just a smokescreen for your ignorant, redneck views. Immigration 9whether through humanitarian immigration or the old kind where we take people in) is nation building, how country wasn't developed off a sheep's back, it was developed from the labour of the international community coming to our shores, they will work hard and strive hard to make a better world for thier children, that is why they are fleeing Syria, they will pay taxes and build communities, they will invest in industry and support growth and jobs, this is the truth, these are the facts, you may not like them but you cannot deny them. 12,000 people is nothing, it is a weak response to a global crisis, and $44 million is a drop int he ocean, we can do so much more, first of all empty our detention centres, costing us 4billion dollars a year, empty our detention centres and abolish negative gearing and superannuation tax concessions and you have effectively stopped the debt from rising,. everything else is simply win win, you get these people working int he community, driving demand, increasing consumption, then the businesses start investing knowing they will be rewarded with profit, then everyone benefits, this is simple economics."

Alert moderator
09 Sep 2015 9:33:27pmThere are very good reasons for destroying ID papers. I'm not a refugee from Asia or the ME but I am a refugee. We fled my country when a military coup occurred. My two uncles protested in the street and later were taken. We never saw them again. My family had our car torched in the middle of the night and a brick thrown through the window. Calls in the middle of the night with no voice on the other end of the phone. Our dog was poisoned. One day we woke up and painted in the side of the house was the message 'tonight you will be burned like your car'. I was quite young at the time. We had no car, almost no money. Our extended family and friends together gathered as much money together as possible and gave it to us. I left with my mother, my sister and my uncle. We dodged military all the way to the border, bribing whoever we needed to. When we reached the border checkpoint my uncle told us to hide while he tried to find us a way through. We thought he could most likely bribe the soldiers. They checked my uncles passport, a soldier got on the phone, and before we knew it he was detained. We never saw him again. That night my mother burned all our ID papers. We walked 4 days through the jungle and eventually after 8 years on the list we were accepted to come to Australia. In those 8 years we children had no schooling, no vaccinations, bad food, and all of us have health problems due to this. In spite of this we have been quite successful here in our new home. Getting rid of ID is quite common when you don't want to identified, not from your place of refuge, but from the place and the people that are looking for you to do you harm, as was seen in the case of my uncle. Oh and we did have to get out. A few nights later our home was torched. Luckily my grandmother was at a neighbours house or she would have died also. I believe that a lot of suspicion comes from people who have never, ever gotten to know a refugee. To really sit down and talk to them. Yes, we came with some money. Our family and friends gave us all they could to save us. Yes we had no ID. The reason for this is not sinister, but merely survival.

10 Sep 2015 6:00:57pmSpacey, I don't doubt your entry to Australia was based on your classification as a refugee, but there are some anomalies in your story there. You say your family was persecuted to the extent that you're lives were at stake because of the actions of your uncles, but other members of your family stayed behind and were left alone? You spent five days escaping with no papers and one can only assume no way of communicating with those you left behind and 8 years in a camp or the like yet you are acutely aware that a few days later your house was burned down and your grandmother nearly killed.People gave you a significant amount of money when you left which you were able to retain through border checkpoints, jungles, and 8 years in refugee camps until you got to Australia?Again, you may be a refugee, but if a refugee told me that story in an attempt to explain why they have large sums of money and no papers I can see no reason why I would believe them.

09 Sep 2015 7:31:48pmIs Dunlop reading a different ABS report than I am? The actual ABS report states that "There were 31,728 Humanitarian migrants, representing 4.0% of all migrant taxpayers in 2009-10. Humanitarian migrants generated 2.4% or $888.8 million of total migrant income". That means that the 4% in question generated 2.4% of the total, so they generated an average of barely over half what the average skilled or family migrant did. The report also relates to private income streams, it specifies "(excluding Government pensions and allowances)" so it only takes into account the non-welfare income. The report should be read alongside the reports this report references, such as the 2011 Australian Census and Migrants Integrated Dataset (ACMID). That report "confirms higher rates of unemployment for migrants who indicated that they spoke English "Not well" or "Not at all" (a verbatim quote from the Humanitarian Migrants section of the ABS report), which is perfectly in line with other government reports that show elevated levels of both poor English skills and welfare dependency along with lower levels of workplace participation in the humanitarian visa stream.

09 Sep 2015 7:35:03pmRegardless of how this issue is framed at any one time, the underlying theme concerning any government is money. What is the sum of each receiving nation's budget for resettling refugees? A vast sum, no doubt.It is a shame that we don't all pool the money and pay any nation that agrees to resettle refugees per head, rather than persist with this hodgepodge approach receiving nations seem to favour now.We could be using this vast some of money to process refugees quickly through orderly transit camps, on their way to receiving nations happy to take them in. We could be stimulating economies and improving infrastructure and services instead of worrying about the bill and griping about each countries contribution on a per capita basis. We could be flying refugees from short stays in orderly transit camps, rather than forcing them to undertake any perilous journey.

Of course. we should take more refugees, selected by the UNHCR, but for humanitarian reasons only.

If, what we are doing is help, how many of you would like to be helped that way?!!! Even as a military strategy it does not make sense. How can you win a war when you remove all people opposing the ISIL from those countries.  Aren't we actually handing them over the country by removing the people who oppose them?

09 Sep 2015 8:44:15pmIf we had full employment the economic contribution of refugees would be a valid argument.But we don't have full employment.  We have more than 750,000 unemployed people.  A number greater than that of all the refugees that Australia has accepted that are still of working age.  None of this refugee labour is needed.There is no economic benefit, there is only burden.  But we knew this already.  Because if refugees were of economic benefit countries  would fight over how many each could take, and there would be no refugee problem.As for detention being a waste of money.  It is the cost we pay to stem the tide of refugees (economic burdens), and to demonstrate our resolve.  This cost is a bargain.

09 Sep 2015 9:21:26pmI'm sorry, Tim but your whole article is nonsense because you are equating our refugee intake with our immigration rate.To quote the Australian Bureau of Statistics (3101.0)For the year ended 31 December 2014, Australia's preliminary net overseas migration (NOM) estimate was 184,100 people. This was 14.8% (32,000 people) lower than the net overseas migration estimated for the year ended 31 December 2013 (216,200 people).We already have an immigration rate ten times our intake of refugees, which should be producing the kind of benefits you claim for an increased refugee intake.  Why is this so consistently ignored?  That's our population problem, not our refugee intake.We could increase our refugee intake to our annual rate of emigration (50 to 70000 a year) and stabilise our population within thirty years, saving our natural environment and promoting well being and prosperity for all Australians.

09 Sep 2015 9:35:17pmAgain this author makes a serious error which simply exposes his bias when he states:"In case it wasn't already blindingly obvious, then, this is in part why calls by members of the Abbott Government for Australia to offer sanctuary only to Christians from Syria are not only offensive to liberal values of decency and equality, but also likely to be counterproductive."The government has talked about taking minorities that are subject to persecution. Yes that includes Christians but it also include Druze and Yazidis who have been mentioned by the government - neither of which are Christian sects and are in fact separate religions again. Fail.

09 Sep 2015 10:09:44pmWell this article is garbage.The 160 Karen is a very poor example, very poor. Who are you trying to fool, Tim? A small amount of people are easy to manage, easier to screen, easier to find jobs for... They're also easier to control.I don't think a small comment is enough to address this situation. Australia is struggling, we have killed our manufacturing industry, our entry level jobs have been outsourced or have been given to 417 visa holders,  leaving thousands of university educated Australians without entry level jobs. We have both sides of government at historically low popularity, I've never in my 35 years seen this much political apathy.We have a liberal government that preaches austerity, but will now spend billions on bombing Syrians, creating even more refugees, more problems. And, let's face it, there will be no end to the Syrian war not for a very very long time, as world powers have taken opposing sides in the conflict.Regarding the 12,000 refugees, my major concern is that we don't have the ability to process effectively this amount of people. Violent criminals (Rapists and Murderers) and terrorists should not be welcomed to Australia. Evidence of our lack of processing capability is sitting on both Manus and Nauru islands.We already have migrants and refugees coming to Australia, but this is seen by the majority of Australians as a major crisis. This problem should be dealt with first and foremost, we can always send financial or material aid to countries already housing/hosting Syrian refugees, while we deal with our own detention/migrant/refugee crisis.There has been a big push by bleeding hearts regarding accepting refugees, these people have a very loud voice in the Australian media, but I suggest everyone should think with your head as well as your heart. Hopefully, you'll come to understand that 10,000 will be more than a tricky number of refugees to settle for our current inept government and opposition.

09 Sep 2015 10:36:39pmSomething occurred to me while I was cooking dinner. Has anyone else noticed that the people constantly claiming that asylum seekers are good for the economy, people like Tim Dunlop and Julian Burnside, are never the ones who would be competing with them for jobs or rental accommodation? Julian Burnside QC does not have to worry about waiting that extra bit longer for a home because refugees are considered to be a "special needs" group and go to the front of the public housing lists. Julian Burnside QC does not have to worry about competing with the asylum seekers he advocates for on the job market in the unskilled sector. I suppose that it is easy to demand a course of action be taken when it is not you who will have to bear the consequences of the action.

09 Sep 2015 10:48:30pmWhile accepting more refugees for resettlement is the right thing to do, the economic case here doesn't bare much scrutiny. To be good for "Australia", newcomers would need to raise workforce participation and average incomes. We're told there were an extra 70 jobs between 160 refugees - a much lower participation rate than the national average. A net present value of $41.5 million between 70 employees comes out at around $30,000 per year per person, hardly hitting the big time. Given that quite a few of those extra jobs in Nhill are probably not taken by Karen people, but are the welfare service providers, ESL trainers and school teachers needed to support the new arrivals, mostly on the public payroll, the case may be even weaker. Relocating welfare-dependent people to regional towns is certainly good for the town's economy, but not for the national economy. No doubt their kids will leave town to look for work, just like those that left before them, and add to the droves of disgruntled job-seekers in major cities.Doing the right thing should not depend on it being of benefit to us. But given that the fiscal cost per refugee is quite large, we should think deeply about whether we could do more good supporting many more refugees where they are, than bringing a few of them here.

10 Sep 2015 5:54:29amI have little to say on the actual detention policy of refugees. That is ...  choices and decisions and even morality.But I can comment about the concepts which Morrison has put into place.  I specifically mention Morrison as  his policy (the current policy) is not backward to Labor. Note:I neither approve of Labor nor the Libs policy - it is that they ARE different - and need to be addressed separately. The model Morrison used was "People are coming. We need to put into place policies which discourage them to come." His response was two fold - deny them entry - and make their life here so horrible that they would go away.In order to do this - he imposed "secrecy" so that he was not questioned.The outcome of his policy? 1) permanent psychological damage to the asylum seekers.2) the boats continued to come.3) The asylum seekers have not magically gone away and continue to be imprisoned at his command.He had to abandon that as a deterrent and work on direct intervention to stop the boats coming. That stopped the boats. Not his "deterrent policy." But he did NOT dismantle the failed policy. He did not cease to punish the innocent. He even justified what he did - on the basis that this damage to people was part of his policy to stop the boats. This was his own words when he had that fiery confrontation with Trigg and was on the witness stand. There can be other reasons for off shore detention - Labor's policy for example. One which does not include punishing the people. I repeat - I do not approve. But I am against the Morrison solution - which continues under Dutton. So when we spend a billion per year to hold these people in misery, you can see the reasoning.That same 1B could finance 60,000 refugees for the same period - and they would actually go off benefits, whilst the detainees are indefinite. Theoretically and financially and morally - I disagree with the Morrison solution.  I have the same negative opinion with Labor's policy - for different moral reasons.But given a choice - Labor over Morrison. The difference between bad and totally without any morality at all. If you insist on detainees - fine. But you can still disagree with the Morrison solution.Why some people want to waste a billion per year on a policy which does not accomplish anything ... I cannot comprehend.  But they insist there are reasons - and might be correct for all I know. But do differentiate between the Morrison way and other paths. You are permitted to yell about "the Morrison solution" and still agree with off shore detention and processing. I sure do.But then, I am against the off shore processing.

10 Sep 2015 9:38:58amLabor, when they were in power, dismantled the Pacific Solution.  As a result 50,000 people arrived by boat, including more than 25,000 in the 2012/13 financial year.  More than 1,000 drowned.  The gender ratio of this 50,000 was 6 males to every female.Europe, with no deterrents in place, is seeing an escalation in asylum seeker/migrant numbers flooding across the Mediterranean.  This influx is heavily skewed towards males too, and thousands are drowning.The cost of our deterrent policies, which include detention, is billions of dollars a year.  The benefit is planned migration over unplanned migration.  These benefits include women and children being granted equal humanitarian access to men, an end to drownings, and control over the size and the cost of migration to Australia.As for the horrendous conditions in detention, these conditions are cushy compared to a UNHCR camp, and optional for those involved.  They are free to leave, just not to Australia.

10 Sep 2015 12:19:09pmI am not interested in discussing the barbed wire policy labelled "stop the boats." The only difference between a barbed wire fence and stopping the boats at sea is the cost of producing the fence. The issue remains the off shore detention centres.And the very specific policies employed by Morrison.You are welcome to believe that your barbed wire policy is justified in that you are stopping the boats.You can jump up and down because 8,000 people a year came by boats.You can pretend to yourself "it is because I care that 1% of those people die at sea - what a human tragedy ... we have to stop the boats." Which is a cop out as you do not give a damn about the humans involved - they are "illegals" and not humans in your lexicon.  But it has nothing to do with off shore processing - and the Morrison solution in particular.Please remember I am neither a Labor hack - nor a Liberal hack - nor a Greenie hack. Shoving a "slogan" and "shouting propaganda" at me does not work.You are going to have to think. Use that had of yours for something more than a hat stand. I have a development disorder and do not think properly. It is sad to see so many normal people who have the most precious commodity - a fully functioning mind - not only fail to use it but let others do their thinking for them. THINK!

Noisy people.There are so many social issues already existing in Australia that have not been resolved, sure why not add a few more.  Time, time is the teller of all.  Something big is up.  Mind you I bet the folks in the detention centres are not going to be happy about not being released into Australia whilst other seekers will be.

For almost one hundred years since the Armenian genocide by the Ottoman Turks in 1915, Christians in the Middle East have been massacred, raped and expelled. As a majority Christian country (cue howls of moral indignation and outrage from post-modern secularists) Australia can do its bit to help these truly persecuted Christian minorities find safety. We really don't need to take Muslims from the Middle East, the persecutors of the Christians, who are commanded by their religion to replace our existing laws by their own, sharia.I doubt the ABC will publish this post.

10 Sep 2015 8:12:57amI think the one flaw with the argument put forward here is that it ignores the fact that the "refugees" tend to get more support than a would be local migrant to a regional area.  I would suggest that if a young local family were given the same support to move to a regional area with good long term employment prospects then they too would add the same value to the regional economy.  Young people tend to move away from regional areas because of limited opportunities for employment.The only real benefit to the economy of an influx of migrants when the local populous is under employed is that it leads to an increase in consumption and therefore economic activity.  At the end of the day increasing the intake of refugees isn't an economic issue.  It's a humanitarian one.I find it interesting that it was only yesterday that the government tried to get the youth unemployment benefit waiting period through the parliament.   It's an interesting conundrum, whether it's more moral to sacrifice your own to help a neighbour.  In my view that move yesterday simply highlights the fact that popularity politics trumps all other things.To avoid a potential witch hunt I will say that I support the decision made, but will be interested to find out who ends up paying for it.

At an average cost of 900 dollars per fortnite (Newstart or DSP PLUS FTB), that is an extra 3OO million a year just in welfare payments for 12000 refugees. Add that to gillards 50000 illegals and the annual welfare cost alone is 1.5 billion. Add on housing and health costs and the  '$1 billion a year detaining asylum seekers offshore' looks like a good investment.

10 Sep 2015 10:46:50amI grew up in the Latrobe Valley, Victoria and later worked with the Snowy Mountains scheme.  The development of both depended greatly on post World War 2 immigration.  By the time I left The Valley more than half the population had been born overseas.  Many of the 'New Australians' were refugees from terrible conditions in Europe.  In their homelands they had lived in fear, brutality, often deprived of education, safety and even the lives of most of their families - not unlike people fleeing war and persecution now.  Many, again like people searching for a safe home now, had no state, identification documents or other possessions.  There was some prejudice among their new neighbours (comments like 'how can you let your daughter go out with a **' dago, bolt, winging Pom, etc. and 'why don't they speak English, like all decent people'), but it faded pretty quickly.  Among the children I saw no problems.  We loved the new and fascinating children that knitted backwards and knew other languages.  We swapped lunches for their exotic food and learnt their games.  Among the adults past enmities were generally left behind as they worked to build their new country.  Indeed, both the Valley and the Snowy Scheme prospered economically as a result of the influx of refugees, but we also benefited immeasurably through friendships and cultural enrichment; and that, without much of the orderly planning and preparation now being advocated.  A bit more preparation and support would be been good, but we do not need to be so hesitant.  Kindness, generosity and a willingness to accept the benefits refugees can give us will go a long way to improving life for all of us.

10 Sep 2015 10:56:57amThis issue isn't just a humanitarian one it reveals  a government and nation that doesn't have an institution that can explain details and complexities without fear of retribution. This is another example of there being no department that can gather information from universities, other departments independent studies and inform the public. The outcome for resettlement then is difficult to plan for or predict which means more guesswork will be involved than necessary. Because parties are dependent on a sponsors donations, it is they that call the shots. A department that informs both the politicians and the public in planning for the future is a superfluous appendage to a sponsor, so political parties have been obediently removing and de funding them for at least two decades. Public opinion has forced the governments hand and it has responded [well done Tony] but we could do this without the blindfold.

10 Sep 2015 2:36:52pmIt is difficult to believe that Australia has been built to a large degree by immigration and acceptance of refugees when reading many of the posts on this site.It seems then that, once settled and slotting into a relatively comfortable and peaceful life, those same immigrants and refugees become the intolerant and selfish people we hear commenting on those queue jumpers and suspect arrivals from the Middle East.When people arrive from largely non English speaking countries it most likely will take at least a generation for those people to become fully participating members of society, particularly where the culture of the people does not encourage, say, women to participate fully in life outside the home.  Some never make the transition to become fully functioning integrated members of the country.  Hopefully the children will gradually discard restrictive cultural norms.Personally I am quite impressed by the number of people from the Middle East who speak English and often have good educations and professions.  This tells me that such people are not accepted by perpetrators of violence and controlling dictatorships and so their need to leave their country behind.We need to admire those who would travel across the world to a foreign country to try to build a better and different life for themselves.   Australians do this regularly leaving their families and travelling to countries to further their careers, ambitions and to satisfy a need to travel and experience other cultures.  The difference is there is not the imperative to preserve life and limb.  They do, however, rarely turn their backs on the country of their birth and still identify as Australian.Let us hope that we continue to be a country, for whom those who roam the world, remain proud to call the place of their birth.

10 Sep 2015 4:31:20pmWhy should we not give a chance for those who need a hand up as opposed to those who are, definitely coming for economic reasons alone?  The fact is that people who choose to emigrate to Australia from a free and fair society are most likely to gain a place because they have the option of applying through normal channels.There are those who do not get that option for one reason or another but most likely they come from countries in turmoil and may destroy their papers for personal security reasons.  After all, if their home country is ruled or controlled by despots or terrorists they are not likely to be given the right to apply to emigrate and the likelihood is that there is no representation from the desired destination country in their own home country.Let's face it. If they lived in a country where they were safe and protected they would not be seeking to leave other than for the same reasons that Australians travel and work in overseas countries.  I cannot imagine what it is like living in a country where armaments and torture are used against citizens and there is no way of knowing what or who is likely to come through the door and decimate their families.  Children have to be traumatised and the normal activities such as education and health care are almost impossible.Finding fault and expecting minority groups to stay and fight is to be accepting genocide.Life is not all about who can make us wealthier and Australia is a fine example of why that is so.  Sometimes we need to take a long term view and appreciate that refugees in time can contribute just as much to their adopted country as anyone else.

10 Sep 2015 3:51:48pmTim Dunlop is developing here a very selective view on the benefits of refugees to the Australian economy. - He took one case study only without giving you any insight into the general picture.In fact, when you look deeper into the ABS statistics, you find that the migrants from all the major regional areas like the Middle East, India, South-East Asia, and East Asia bring in with them a large percentage of people of Working Age who are NOT in the Labour force. - For example, Indian migrants have a lower percentage of people NOT in Labour force (26 per cent) than Australian born (32 per cent). - While migrants from the Middle East (52 per cent), East Asia (42 per cent) and South-East Asia (34 per cent) have a significantly higher percentage of people NOT in Labour force than Australian born (32 per cent).The main thing is that all major migrant groups develop a relatively high percentage of people of Working Age who end up being NOT in the Labour force. This pattern they develop in time, through their evolution within the mainstream community, and it is false argument to look at a static frame, in a single selected case of refugee adaptation.

10 Sep 2015 4:22:32pmConsider also the following simple picture:Australia has nearly 3 million of Working Age people who are not in the labour force (2.92 million, ABS). - This 3 million of people are Not Disabled, since the Disabled belong to a different category. - Nearly 600,000 out of this 3 million are from Asia, Middle East and Africa - Thus all these "invisible" people who do not participate in employment are totally different from those who are Unemployed. - The Unemployed are considered as Part of the Labour force, an active part , the people who are willing to engage if the right kind of job comes around.But side by side with the Unemployment figures, we get here another 600,000 of non-European migrants who (for some reason) do not come here to be productively engaged in Australian society. - These people somehow find ways and means to live without participating in legal employment. - They are not "seen" by the government and by the economists because they don't want to see them. - They don't want to see them because it would clearly demonstrate one thing, either the failure of govenment's immigration strategy, or failure of our Border Control in the past 25 years. Now, the final question is: Do you honestly want another 100,000 refugee arrivals within next two or three years?
