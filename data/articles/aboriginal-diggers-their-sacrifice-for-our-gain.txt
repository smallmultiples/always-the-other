As ibis stalk the length of the Pool of Remembrance, foraging with their black scythe beaks, a cold wind blows their white feathers against the grain.Directly descended from the temple friezes of Pharaoh's Egypt, the birds' bid to represent the ancient world is eclipsed by the smoking gum leaves and murmuring didgeridoo of a culture far older.Its National Reconciliation Week, and Sydney is commemorating the service and sacrifice of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander veterans, and celebrating the contribution of Indigenous serving members of the Australian Defence Forces. It happens each year now, at the Anzac Memorial on the last Friday in May.A dance performed by small, painted, shivering students from Matraville Soldiers Settlement Public School follows the welcome to country. The Catafalque Party is mounted with perfect precision to a staccato drum beat.The striking figure of MC David Williams steers the ceremony with the steady hand of a submariner with 29 years' Royal Australian Navy service, and a proud history of 23 family members in the Defence Forces, from the Light Horse to the present day.Since the Boer War, Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders have fought for Australia. Possibly 500–800 served in World War I, with five Aboriginal diggers known to have died at Gallipoli; anywhere from 3,000 to 6,000 served in World War II. All this before any of them were counted as citizens of the country.On the night of 28 July 1918 at Morlancourt, Private William Rawlings and his comrades attacked a German communications trench system, routing the enemy. Rawlings displayed rare bravery. He was awarded the Military Medal. (The Black Diggers by Robert H Hall)They went with songs to the battle, they were young,Straight of limb, true of eye, steady and aglow .They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted;They fell with their faces to the foe. (Ode of Remembrance)Private William Irwin, 33rd Battalion, was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for single-handedly rushing three machine gun posts during fighting in the Mont St Quentin area on August 31, 1918. He died the following day from wounds sustained.They shall grow not old as we that are left grow old.Age shall not weary them nor the years condemn.At the going down of the sun, and in the morning,We will remember them. (Ode of Remembrance)Warrant Officer Leonard Waters was the first Indigenous Australian to earn his 'wings' as a pilot. During 1944/45, Waters served in 78 Squadron RAAF, flying his "Black Magic" Kittyhawk fighter in Dutch New Guinea, Morotai and Borneo, bombing and strafing Japanese positions.Lance Corporal Kath Walker of Stradbroke Island, Qld enlisted in the AWAS in l942 after her two brothers were taken prisoner in Singapore. Later known as Oodgeroo Noonuccal, she was the first Aboriginal Australian to publish a book of verse:To our father's fathersThe pain, the sorrow;To our children's childrenThe glad tomorrow.Corporal Roy Mundine served with distinction with the 5th Battalion in South Vietnam. Private Steve Dodd served in Korea with the lst Battalion RAR. So the long honour roll unfolds up to the present day.I'm accompanied by two Year 12 students from St Joseph's College, impressive young Indigenous men planning a career in the military. The three of us are captivated by the guest speaker, Captain Chloe Dray, an Indigenous officer serving in the Army with Norforce.Her story takes us on an epic journey from her home country, proudly proclaimed, through some tough hurdles, the achievement of a fine tertiary education, and an Army career. Her enthusiasm, her bearing and the self-confidence of a true professional make her a poster woman for the military life.Her proud family, sitting beside us, are shedding a few silent tears. Only they would know the cost of her success.Next, the many wreaths are laid, piling colour upon colour at the foot of the cenotaph. A little party of Indigenous school children with their trousers rolled up wade into the Pool of Remembrance with their tribute of a circle of red and yellow blooms.The Last Post cuts across the hum of the traffic and the seagulls' shriek. A young serviceman faints but the one minute's silence is barely disturbed by the quiet, immediate attendance of the St John Ambulance officers.Released from the spell of the ceremony, we are free to mingle. The schoolgirls and boys mob Captain Chloe. My young companions are unselfconsciously handsome and dignified as they join the Minister for Veterans Affairs and Indigenous Defence Force leaders for a yarn, and to be photographed for The Koori Times.And that is the triumph of the morning ... to see the new young generation of Indigenous Australians taking their place with confidence in society, and so redeeming the sacrifice and fulfilling the hopes of the forbears who were honoured today.Last Monday's Australian Story is a perfect illustration of this new generation, featuring the Indigenous Mentoring Experience created by young Jack Manning Bancroft.Caroline Jones is a writer and broadcaster for the ABC, and a presenter for Australian Story.

Comments for this story are closed.01 Jun 2012 2:23:11pmIt's always good to get positive stories about Aboriginal Australians -- too many are negative.However I don't agree with the calls to have separate war memorials for servicemen of Aboriginal decent (or for that matter, any other race). It's a form of apartheid.P.S. Apartheid is pronounced "apart-hate".

01 Jun 2012 3:37:51pmIt's always good to get positive stories about Aboriginal Australians -- too many are negative. I  wholeheartedly agree with the calls to have additional war memorials for servicemen of Aboriginal descent . It's a form of respect.Especially given they died for the Queen and country before gaining any recognition as citizens in their own land.P.S. Apartheid is a vile construct by one of the most racist white supremacist regimes in history and is in no way applicable to this discussion.So it does not apply.The mention of it devalues any contribution associated with it.Lest We Forget, indeed.

01 Jun 2012 3:40:39pmWe should also acknowlege the brave fighters(and the women and children) who fought and died for these lands during the frontier wars. It's interesting how we lionise Imperial Forces fighting for britain in WW1, but ignore the wars on these soils.

01 Jun 2012 3:41:04pmI tend to agree with Jungle Boy on this one.  Aboriginal culture and history should be at the centre of modern Australia, not set apart.  Lets leave that in the past.

01 Jun 2012 4:18:58pmI agree JJ, I served in Vietnam with indigenous soldiers and they were my brothers then and still are.  I would be proud to share a memorial with them anytime.

01 Jun 2012 3:07:03pmIt is a sign of the times we are currently in that a story of sacrifice and bravery of Austrralians who at the time were nto even recognised as citizens rates not a sinlge comment in the first horu and a bit of posting yet we are all happy to crap on about wherther Julie is better than Tony and other irrelevant stuff. These men and women served ac ountry who wouldnt even recognise them , happily sent them tio war and when they returned refused them soldier settlers blocks. It si said that there is only green in the trenches, fox holes etc ,yet these blokes werent even allowed into the RSL for a drink . Reality check time folks , there are more important things in the world that Gillard and Abbott

01 Jun 2012 3:42:56pmAgreed.  All points.  The RSL in particular.  Of all organisations, the RSL should have recognised their service from the day they came home.  A stain on their reputation.

01 Jun 2012 3:37:54pmWhat a well written emotional story, the pride I feel for my mob can not be measured. While most Indigenous Australian's would know of the contibution given by our mob in war, alas it is not widely known in the main stream. Hearing that our young people participated in this event is inspiring. Great story.

01 Jun 2012 3:55:21pmIt is hard to quantify the gain we got from the diggers sacrifices,But it is a large group of people who benefit,and it the diggers themselves had all the suffering,I find the title a bit missleading,possibly deliberately soin that there is an implication that we unfairly beneifted from the particular sacrifice of aboriginal diggers,to possibly suggest that the non-aboriginal diggers gained more

01 Jun 2012 5:34:12pmWell, non-aboriginal diggers gained the respect of the nation, whereas Aboriginal diggers in WW1 and WW2 came back home to no pay, no acknowledgment and no respect.Google the case of Mr Lovett, an Aboriginal man who fought in WW1 and WW2.  He came home and was swept aside as the land his people had nurtured by for 50000 years was given to non Aboriginal diggers.  Mr Lovett applied for a returned servicemen land grant but was rejected, even though he fully met the criteria.My point is that Aboriginal diggers most certainly missed out on the support and acknowledgment of the nation as well as any material benefit from being a digger.  Therefore, any of these material benefits did go to non Aboriginal people.

01 Jun 2012 4:51:15pmThank you. You make an important point.  Indigenous Australians continue to make an important contribution to our country's security both within the military and police.

The truth is that the policy at the time was that full blooded Aboriginals were not recognised as citizens had their applications denied when the applied. (Having said that there would have been some who got through the process just as minors got through).Those who have fought for their land in distant and foreign lands were half casts (one parent Aboriginal, the other an Anglo.Still its nice to see some recognition for them.

01 Jun 2012 5:46:58pmThe heading to this story is:"A new generation of Indigenous Australians are taking their place in society, so redeeming the sacrifices of their forbears."This is just plain wrong. The new generation are not redeeming anything - the new generation is reliving, reinvisioning, reinvigorating or even reminding us of their forbears' sacrifices.We applaud the sacrifice of both the early and late Indigenous soldiers - there is nothing for them to redeem.

01 Jun 2012 7:26:05pmLets put this in context- both the world wars were caught by people who were usually conscripted and often fighting on behalf of an empire rather than their own country or land. Huge numbers of Indians and Africans also fought and died far from home at a time when they had little or no recognition of their citizenship or other rights. Aboriginal Australians were treated horribly, but they were not singled out for unusual treatment. Back in the 'good old days' life was made downright s#@t for a lot of people.
