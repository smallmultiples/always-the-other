Defence Minister Joel Fitzgibbon has suggested that people opposed to his reform agenda may be behind today's reports that his own department secretly investigated his relationship with a Chinese-Australian businesswoman.The Defence Department has ordered an urgent investigation into the claims, which were published by Fairfax newspapers today.The newspaper report says the department was concerned that Mr Fitzgibbon's relationship with Sydney businesswoman Helen Liu caused a security risk, and says Defence used the Defence Signals Directorate to infiltrate Mr Fitzgibbon's office computer system.The Fitzgibbon and Liu families have been friends for over 15 years and Ms Liu is also known to be a Labor supporter.Speaking briefly this afternoon in response to the allegations, Mr Fitzgibbon said he would not be backing down from his reform agenda."I am driving the biggest reform project in the history of the Defence organisation and I know that's really hard for some elements of that organisation," he said."But I'm doing so in close partnership with the Chief of the Defence Force and the secretary of my Department and together we are determined to continue our pursuit of those much needed reforms and we are determined to secure those reforms."Mr Fitzgibbon said no concerns over the relationship had ever been raised with him."I've said on a number of occasions I've had a close personal relationship with the Lius for some 16 years now, and over that period of time there's been an exchange of a number of small gifts," he said."If anyone had concerns about that relationship they should have come forward and shared them with me."This morning Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said neither the Chief of the Defence Force Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston nor Department head Nick Warner had seen any intelligence report on Mr Fitzgibbon.But Mr Fitzgibbon has remained tight-lipped on whether they have confirmed to him they knew nothing of the report."These allegations now are all subject to an inquiry and I have no intention of further commenting on them until those processes are complete," he said."I am not going to pre-empt the outcomes of those investigations. That would be unfair to all involved - including me."The Minister's relationship with the Defence Department appeared to have broken down several weeks ago after Mr Fitzgibbon branded the department as "incompetent" over its handling of a pay bungle affecting SAS soldiers.Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull has called for Mr Fitzgibbon to be sacked and also wants the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security to investigate the claims."We've seen today another unhappy episode in the career of this incompetent minister," he said."Now we see another extraordinary episode underlining what appears to be a complete breakdown of the relationship of confidence between him and his Department"Mr Rudd seems to be trying to brush this under the carpet."Earlier today Mr Fitzgibbon's father Eric, who was also a Labor MP, said it was ridiculous to suggest the relationship between the two families was improper and accused Defence of a "slanderous attack".The Department is yet to release a statement on the allegations.
