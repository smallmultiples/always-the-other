The Defence Department is urgently investigating allegations that its staff spied on their Minister over his friendship with a Chinese-Australian businesswoman.Fairfax newspapers are reporting that Joel Fitzgibbon's relationship with Helen Liu was investigated by the Defence Department using the powerful spy agency, the Defence Signals Directorate, to access his office computer system.Speaking from the United States, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd confirmed that Department head Nick Warner has asked for an inquiry.But he also said that no intelligence report has been seen by the Chief of the Defence Force Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston or Mr Warner."Therefore I will await the outcome of that investigation," he said.Mr Rudd is also yet to speak with Mr Fitzgibbon over the matter.Mr Fitzgibbon's relationship with his own department has been strained in recent weeks after he called it "incompetent" over a pay bungle involving SAS soldiers."Plainly there are always tensions and there have been for quite some time between Defence ministers in the past and the Defence Department, there is nothing particularly unusual about that," Mr Rudd said."But on this particular matter I simply relay to you the advice I've just received from Canberra."Mr Fitzgibbon's father, Eric, a former Labor MP, has lashed out at the deparment over the allegations after confirming that the Liu and Fitzgibbon families have been friends for around 15 years.Mr Fitzgibbon Senior described the alleged actions of Defence as "a slanderous attack" and "completely unwarranted.""I think if you understand the politics of Defence you'd appreciate that they're not getting on too well with Joel and the hierarchy in the Defence Department," he told ABC 2 News Breakfast.Mr Fitzgibbon senior says while it is true the Liu family are Labor supporters there is "no possibility" anything improper would be discovered about the friendship."It's a storm in a teacup really.""It's ridiculous to suggest that there's anything wrong in the relationship between the Fitzgibbon family and the Liu family," he said."Helen Liu and the Liu family are Labor supporters - that's fair enough."When asked whether the alleged actions of Defence were an act of revenge, Mr Fitzgibbon senior replied: "Where else has it come from?"Mr Fitzgibbon and the Defence Department are yet to comment on the claims.Consultant Alan Behm, who used to head the department's international policy and strategy divisions and the strategy branch of the department, has described the allegations as extraordinary.Mr Behm says it is not standard procedure for a department to ever investigate its own minister and if true, the allegations suggest the department is trying to undermine Mr Fitzgibbon."If there are concerns about the ethics and legality of any of the Minister's activities that's a matter that would be raised through the proper channels with the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister would do something about it," he told Radio National."Departments just simply don't act unilaterally against their ministers."Mr Behm believes that if an officer has acted without authorisation the person would most likely be sacked, but if the alleged investigation was authorised it raises serious questions about the Department for the Government."If it's authorised that begs the bigger question of who was involved in this and what authority was given to anybody to do this and if that goes up the chain of decision making and command within Defence then the Government has got a real problem with that department," he said.Former parliamentary secretary for defence procurement Greg Combet has similarly described the reports as "extraordinary", acknowledging that it is not normal practice for a department to investigate a minister."I'm certainly surprised reading the report," he told Sky News."I think it's appropriate that the investigation that's been launched into how this came about be allowed to unfold."Shadow attorney-general George Brandis says Mr Fitzgibbon has no option but to go because his relationship with the Department has become untenable."When you have a minister who is not trusted by his department, who doesn't trust his department and effectively cannot work with his department, then I think that there's really only one course of action that's possible," he told ABC 2 News Breakfast."That is for the minister to go and be replaced by someone who can get a handle on things."It is extremely important in the national interest that all ministers, in particular the Defence Minister, have a functional working relationship with their departments and this minister plainly does not."
