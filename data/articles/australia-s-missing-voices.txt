A local feature film maker said to me recently, "Looking at the broad sweep of Australian films you'd think we were Sweden." He was referring to the predominance of northern European faces on our screens.It's the kind of lament I've heard repeatedly over the past few weeks, while researching an interview series for Radio National with storytellers from diverse cultural backgrounds.As a nation we are second only to Israel in terms of cultural diversity, yet looking at the majority of our films, novels and television, you wouldn't know it.That's not to diminish those few noteworthy pioneers that have tried to explore our cosmopolitan society on screen and in print thus far. Artists as diverse as comedian Nick Giannopoulos and Hong Kong born filmmaker Clara Law.But their stories have been exceptions to the norm.Australian storytelling is still playing catch up to the great demographic changes that have transformed our country from a southern hemisphere Anglo outpost to a rich, cosmopolitan society.In part, this may be because many of the older generations, those with established careers in the arts who came of age in the 1970s, don't feel the new stories are theirs to tell. It's also because many of the individuals who have lived amid the cultural diversity, who are products of it, are only now finding their voice.It seems that only after migrants populate our suburbs, our factories and shops, after they've entered into the professions, and even into politics, do they enter into our stories.Today it is possible to envisage a real change in our mainstream sense of collective identity, informed by cultural diversity and traditions from beyond the Anglosphere.It's about time.In the late nineties and early noughties, the resurgence of social tensions and xenophobia with the One Nation phenomenon and events like the Cronulla riots was a disturbing regression.It coincided with what seemed like indifference at the official level towards anything that resembled a national self interrogation over issues like multiculturalism - or reconciliation and republicanism.The result was a reaffirmation of traditional Anglo-Celt notions of Australian identity, despite the fact that Australian life had changed on the ground after decades of mass migration from non-English speaking countries.Now, much has changed in the overall mood.The leaders of both major political parties are avowed republicans and reconciliation has returned to centre stage. But what of multiculturalism?Last month the federal government did announce the formation of the Australian Multicultural Advisory Council. But so far, Rudd, like Howard, has been cool on the 'm' word.Australian storytellers, meanwhile, have taken up the role of reminding us that we, as a country, are a multifaceted work in progress. In truth many have been confronting the issue for a while, but there is a shared feeling that we are seeing a new surge now.Perhaps surprisingly, the biggest budget local film of all time - the studio backed Australia - has offered one of the first breaths of fresh air. In his depiction of the outback, director Baz Luhrmann conjures a kind of proto-multiculturalism seldom portrayed by other filmmakers. There's Ivan, the publican from the Balkans, there's the Chinese-Australian cook and there's a predominantly Asian-Australian Darwin.What's refreshing about all this diversity is that it feels natural and un-self conscious - not the main focus of the film.This year sees the release of several films dealing directly with diversity and the migrant experience. The Combination and Cedar Boys look at cross cultural tensions in Western Sydney; Two Fists, One Heart is a migrant story from Perth.On television, a new SBS series Carla Cametti PD reaffirms the broadcaster's long history of multicultural drama and comedy, following on from the summer serve of bawdy, in your face comedy from Paul Fenech's stable, Swift and Shift Couriers.In literature, Nam Le has won the prestigious Dylan Thomas Prize for his debut collection of short stories The Boat, which shows his breadth as a storyteller, taking in the Vietnamese Australian experience but so much more beyond that. And Christos Tsiolkas, now a veteran with six books published, has released a new novel The Slap in which he's dealing with something he describes as a new cosmopolitan middle class.These are only a few examples.If we're to see a new era flourish we have to acknowledge the power relations at play and how, like all countries, we have a cultural 'centre' and a periphery, kept apart by institutions, money and gatekeepers.As always, the tension over whether the gatekeepers change to accommodate new voices or whether outsiders change to accommodate the tastes of the gatekeepers is critical.This isn't a racial, ethnic or religious divide. This isn't about 'Anglos' versus everyone else.This a tension that you can find anywhere, one that exists between what has gone before and what is coming up.Compromise will always be a factor.A danger, however, is that the great Australian myth in which we see ourselves as an egalitarian society might obfuscate the very real power imbalances that exist in our culture.We must not become complacent. We must not assume that everybody has had a fair go.The key to more diverse, vibrant storytelling, for gatekeepers and storytellers alike, is to never take anything for granted.
