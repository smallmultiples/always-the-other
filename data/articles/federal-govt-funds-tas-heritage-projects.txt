The Federal Government has contributed $1.7 million towards the Trail of the Tin Dragon project in Tasmania's north-east.The trail would run from Launceston to St Helens, celebrating the contribution of Chinese miners to the area.It would include a Chinese temple and interpretation.The federal Member for Bass, Michael Ferguson, says the development would be an important tourist drawcard."There is enormous heritage values in the north-east, including Chinese-Australian and the tin mining that we enjoy," he said."These things can be developed in a way that is attractive to tourist to bring them to Tasmania and importantly bring them to that region."The Federal Government has also committed $275,000 to a new museum at George Town to house the Norfolk replica, which was built for a re-enactment of the 1798 voyages by Matthew Flinders and George Bass.Mr Ferguson says the museum is an important project for Tasmania."It's an important part of Tasmania's heritage, which was very nearly lost to the mainland," he said."Being able to step in and secure some federal funds that will see the boat housed in a museum in George Town is great for George Town but also great for Tasmania."
