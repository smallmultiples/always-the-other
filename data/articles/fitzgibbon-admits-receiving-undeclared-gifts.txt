Defence Minister Joel Fitzgibbon has admitted he received substantial, undeclared gifts from a Chinese-born businesswoman, after earlier denying it.The Defence Department is investigating whether some of its officials spied on Mr Fitzgibbon's relationship with Helen Liu, who he says is a close family friend.Newspaper reports claimed officers within Mr Fitzgibbon's department were investigating his relationship with Chinese-Australian Ms Liu after concerns the friendship posed a security risk.He previously said that he has only ever received small Christmas and birthday gifts from Ms Liu.But his office has released a statement saying Ms Liu had, in fact, paid for him to visit China in 2002 and 2005, and gave him a suit last year, which he later returned."I have taken immediate steps to declare this sponsored travel to the clerk of registrar of members' interests," he said in the statement."These trips were paid for by Ms Helen Liu either personally or through her associated commercial interests."I failed to disclose those trips. This was a mistake and for that I apologise."Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard ordered Mr Fitzgibbon to make the apology, but expressed her confidence in the Minister.Prime Minister Kevin Rudd who is on a two-week tour of the United States and Britain had earlier distanced himself for the domestic controversy, failing to offer an endorsement of the Defence Minister.It was left to Ms Gillard to back Mr Fitzgibbon after he advised her of his mistake.She received an assurance from Mr Fitzgibbon that he would follow her directive to make an apology and correct the record."The Acting Prime Minister accepted this assurance and expressed her full confidence in the Minister for Defence," a spokeswoman for Ms Gillard said.The revelation has strengthened calls for Mr Fitzgibbon to be sacked following a string of controversies involving his department.Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull called on Mr Rudd to take immediate action over Mr Fitzgibbon's "incompetence"."Kevin Rudd must stop making excuses for this disgracefully incompetent minister," he said."A responsible Prime Minister would sack Joel Fitzgibbon immediately."Mr Fitzgibbon suggested that people opposed to his reform agenda may be behind the reports."I am driving the biggest reform project in the history of the Defence organisation and I know that's really hard for some elements of that organisation," he said earlier."But I'm doing so in close partnership with the chief of the Defence Force and the secretary of my department and together we are determined to continue ... those much needed reforms."The latest problems come as the Government tries to finalise its white paper on defence.ANU Professor and visiting fellow with the Lowy Institute, Hugh White, says these events are unlikely to disrupt that process."Defence always tends to operate at two levels. On the one hand there's the sort of day-to-day dramas of things like SAS pay, which crop up periodically in the defence portfolio, really under any government and under any minister," he said."And then there's the long-term questions. The long-term issues can be going along quite well and the short-term issues can be looking very ugly."So, I don't think this is going to cause any particular problems in developing the white paper."- ABC/AAP
