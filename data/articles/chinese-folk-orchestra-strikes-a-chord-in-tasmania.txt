A concert by one of China's premier folk orchestras is expected to provide another boost for Tasmania's exposure in the country.The China Conservatory Orchestra's concert follows last week's historic visit to Hobart by Chinese president Xi Jinping, which was also expected to bring economic benefits and establish cultural ties.The orchestra is where Mr Xi's wife, Peng Liyuan, began her singing career.Cindy Xin, from Chinese Australian arts company Ausfeng, said the president brought the 25-piece orchestra to Australia as part of his G20 visit.The orchestra, formed in 1964, was set to perform in Hobart and Sydney, with all shows broadcast via Chinese state media."All our concerts are covered by the China CQV television station and I think it will surely increase the profile of Tasmania," Ms Xin said."(Thanks to) the president's visit, Tasmania and Hobart are in the spotlight in China. "Everybody is talking about Hobart, everybody is talking about the bear - it's so popular now in China."The bear in question is a purple, lavender filled toy known as Bobbie, given to the president and his wife during last Tuesday's whistlestop tour.A Tasmanian instrument maker and his musician wife helped the group find local instruments, to help the orchestra save on hefty shipping fees.John Akerman has built and repaired string instruments for the past 40 years.His wife, Audrey, is a teacher who had access to local cellos and a double bass.In exchange for the favour, members of the orchestra spent time with the couple, teaching them to play one of China's favourite stringed instruments, the erhu."Before I heard some local people say, they don't really know about Chinese culture or folk music, they don't know what is erhu," Ms Xin said."So I think that is a brilliant opportunity."Mr Akerman repaired one of the two stringed instruments many years ago but never learned to play it."I've had one experience with the erhu, but it's fairly vague in my memory because I've repaired all sorts of other peculiar instruments," Mr Akerman said.Erhu player Mak E said after a brief lesson and a unique rendition of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star that the pair showed promise.
