Defence Minister Joel Fitzgibbon says it remains to be seen whether a "rogue element" within the Defence Department may have secretly spied on him.The Defence Department and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security are investigating whether officers conducted a covert operation into the Minister over his 16-year friendship with Chinese-Australian businesswoman Helen Liu.Mr Fitzgibbon says he is satisfied that no one within the high ranks of Defence would have been involved in any operation to spy on him but says he does not know whether others may have acted on their own."Whether there's a rogue element further down the ranks I don't know but I'll leave it for the inquiry to determine those things," he told Radio National.The relationship between the Minister and the Department has been strained in recent months after the Minister criticised the Department over its handling of the debacle involving the over-payment of SAS soldiers.But Mr Fitzgibbon has also expressed "absolute confidence" in Department head Nick Warner, amid speculation he will be replaced when his contract ends later this year."I think reasonably he wants to be seen along with me and the Chief of Defence as the person that finally drove real reform in the Defence Department and on that basis he's been an enthusiastic partner," he said.The focus on Mr Fitzgibbon's relationship with Ms Liu in the wake of the allegations forced him to make an embarrassing apology after he admitted he had not declared two trips to China which Ms Liu paid for.Mr Fitzgibbon is yet to speak to Prime Minister Kevin Rudd about the matter."I haven't had a chance to discuss the matter with the Prime Minister and of course I'm more than comfortable with doing so," he said.
