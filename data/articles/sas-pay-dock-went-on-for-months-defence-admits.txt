The Defence Department has admitted it continued docking the pay of almost a dozen SAS soldiers even after the Defence Minister ordered it stop.The Department will reform its pay procedures following recommendations by an investigation into the pay bungle.Defence Secretary Nick Warner says the department has agreed to five recommendations made by an independent auditor, which include a major restructure of its pay procedures.The soldiers complained after the Department informed them they had been paid above their level of qualification.Soldiers' pay packets were docked after it was deemed they were not eligible for allowances they had already received.The Department has today acknowledged the incident upset and inconvenienced members of the Special Forces.Defence says the reasons for the pay bungle are complex and it tried to stop the debt recovery, but its efforts took time.Defence Minister Joel Fitzgibbon announced at the beginning of March he was sending in independent auditors to check the records of all SAS soldiers, after the Department was unable to tell him how many soldiers were affected and how much money was involved.After the issue was revealed last October the Defence Minister said he would fix the problem and ordered that Defence not seek to recover any more money.However Mr Fitzgibbon faced calls for his sacking when further claims were made in February that some soldiers were still having their pays docked.The row over the bungle left the relationship between Mr Fitzgibbon and Defence at an all-time low with the Minister calling the Department incompetent over its handling of the matter.The relationship has been strained further in the past week after it was alleged the Defence had secretly investigated the Minister over his relationship with Chinese-Australian businesswoman Helen Liu.
