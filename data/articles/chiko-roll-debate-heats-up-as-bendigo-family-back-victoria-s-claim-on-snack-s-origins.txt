A central Victorian family related to inventors of the savoury snack, the Chiko Roll, has stepped up its fight for recognition in Bendigo.Last week, two Nationals MPs from New South Wales and the Labor MP for Bendigo debated the true origins of the deep-fried roll.Now members of McEncroe family want the public and Federal Parliament to know there were three brains behind the deep fried Australian delight.Three brothers Leo, Gerry and Frank McEncroe were working at a dairy factory in Bendigo and produced the roll.Frank, who is often credited for inventing the Chiko Roll, was born in Castlemaine and produced them in Bendigo.He moved to the city aged 24 and lived there until he reached his 70s. But the daughter of Leo, Jedda Noonan, said her father and two uncles were all responsible for the creation."Firstly they were dairy farmers and then they went onto to be caterers," she said.Ms Noonan said the men worked well together - Leo lived until he was 98 years old, passing away in 2014. Gerry died in 1986 and Frank in 1979."Frank was an entrepreneur and he wanted to take it to Melbourne and the brothers didn't want to go so they stayed and Frank went to Melbourne," she said.It was first known as the snack roll and the Chiko name came about when it went to Melbourne.But Labor's Lisa Chesters said the savoury piece was also sold locally in Bendigo."Because it was sold so widely here in our pubs, at our football matches, at our ag shows, there is that strong sense that ... well yeah it's Bendigo's," she said. The family explained the snack was invented in the cool room they used at the dairy factory.A fork was used to lower the rolls into batter and then oil for deep-drying, before they were cooled and packed into boxes to be sold.Ms Chesters said the ingredients had changed over the years with the family confirming both beef and mutton were used. "They did confirm there's never been any chicken in the roll," she said.But Ms Noonan said even animal feed was thrown into the mix at times."They ran out of cabbages and my dad had a plot of lucerne out the back so he put that in so he was really before his time wasn't he," she said.Although the snack was sold at the Wagga Wagga show, Ms Chesters is keen to lay Bendigo's claim."Somebody there thought it'd be a great marketing ploy for their show," she said."It was popular at the Wagga Wagga show but it was actually popular everywhere."The recipe has now been purchased by Simplot, a food manufacturer based in Bathurst.Last week, Masons of Bendigo restaurant decided to grab a piece of the action and create their own recipe."We're using dry aged beef from Inglewood and black pearl barley which is organically grown," chef and owner Nick Anthony said. "Lots of Bendigo produce is the idea of the dish as well."The restaurant has a reputation for fine dining but Mr Anthony was not concerned about changing up the menu."We had a guest yesterday saying he absolutely hated the Chiko Roll but he was loving the new version so that was good feedback," he said. "Look we're still retaining what our restaurant is about."The restaurant recently won a hat in this year's Age Good Food Guide. "We wanted it to be the best Chiko Roll in Australia," Mr Anthony said.Ms Chesters plans to make another statement in Federal Parliament to acknowledge the three brothers contribution to the iconic roll and its early sales in Bendigo.It appears the food fight will continue on the political stage.
