Cinema chain Hoyts has revealed it is considering funding Australian film production and has even considered rescuing Tropfest.Australian content has helped boost box office takings this year and chief executive Damien Keogh sees supporting the recently collapsed short film festival as a way to do that.The financial scandal that cancelled Tropfest has left filmmakers and fans devastated and hoping for a white knight."We think Tropfest is very important for the Australian movie scene," Mr Keogh told ABC's The Business. "There has been some internal discussions about how or where we may be able to get involved in those kind of things moving forward."We've had a very, very strong year in Australian box office which is great; The Dressmaker is doing really good business at the moment at over $10 million, we've had Oddball which did very well, Paper Planes earlier in the year and obviously the Water Diviner and Mad Max."A champion of Australian films, Mr Keogh is also a champion in his own right, playing for the national basketball team in three Olympic Games. He is now chairman of the Cronulla Sharks NRL team.Hoyts was bought out earlier this year by billion-dollar Chinese property-developer-come-entertainment-juggernaut Wanda Cinema Line Corp for a rumoured $900 million.Wanda also owns the biggest cinema chain in China, with more than 150 theatres, and America's second-largest cinema chain AMC Holdings which it bought for $US2.6 billion.Wanda has already invested heavily in revamping some of Hoyts tired cinemas with snazzy leather recliner seats, but Mr Keogh indicates he is keen to see investment in content too."From a personal perspective I think our Australian movie and our Australian creative area of our business â€” we need to continue to invest in it and particularly culturally significant movies and content," Mr Keogh said."We're very excited that next year there will be a sequel for Red Dog coming out which is great."Wanda is also spending around $13 billion on a movie studio and entertainment complex north of Shanghai, which could be used for Australian films.
