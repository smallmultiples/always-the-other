Federal Treasurer Scott Morrison has "betrayed the future of Australians" by signing off on the sale of Australia's largest dairy, Van Diemen's Land Company (VDL), to a foreign investor, high-profile businesswoman Jan Cameron says. The Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) approved the $280 million purchase by Chinese businessman Lu Xianfeng's Moon Lake Investments on Tuesday.Mr Morrison said he considered the national interest test and how it applied to this case, including the likely impact on local jobs and increased investment to support economic growth.Ms Cameron, who founded outdoor clothing and equipment company Kathmandu, last month launched a campaign against the sale.She said she was disappointed her move to underwrite a rival bid to challenge the offer from Moon Lake Investments failed."It's very disappointing. I think it's a very short-sighted decision by the Treasurer, and he's betrayed the future of many generations of Australians," she said.Ms Cameron said she wanted to create a premier Tasmanian-owned brand that would appeal to Chinese customers."You have to have a strong story of the providence of milk, where it's coming from, how the animals are treated, what chemicals you're using."This is what overseas people want, pure product from Tasmania.He's betrayed the future of many generation of Australians. "Australian agricultural products are highly prized throughout the world and we're really underselling ourselves by just churning out bulk commodity products."We're missing out on jobs in Australia by doing this."Mr  Lu has pledged to create an extra 95 jobs by investing $100 million into developing VDL herds that total almost 18,000 cows.Ms Cameron dismissed accusations her opposition to the sale was xenophobic."I've had a very long trading relationship with businesses in China," she said."In fact, my first boyfriend was Chinese."The Federal Agriculture Minister, Barnaby Joyce, gave lukewarm support to the sale."Obviously, I always have a preference for the Australian asset to be owned by the Australian people, but not to the exclusion of foreign investment," he said."And what we must understand with the Van Diemen's Land Company parcel of land, it has always been foreign owned."Mr Joyce pointed to the sale as a test of Australia’s tough new tax laws."It will be the first entity to be covered by the new multinational tax arrangements and laws that have been brought in by the Treasurer," he said.Australia will get a "proper return so that we can support our hospitals and our schools and our roads, with the wealth that is made from this piece of land which is Australian", he said.Senator Nick Xenophon has also criticised FIRB's decision.He said the sale should have been rejected, because there were offers from Australian-owned businesses.Aside from Ms Cameron's bid, TasFoods launched legal against the New Zealand-based owner of VDL New Plymouth after it was overlooked as a potential buyer.TasFoods was awarded a $1.25 million out-of-court settlement."Here was an opportunity to get VDL in Australian hands with a strong focus on a premier product and creating more local jobs, and that's why this is so disappointing," Mr Xenophon said."I actually have a lot of respect for Chinese investors because they can see the value of investing in prime Australian agricultural land.The problem with our legislation as it now stands is there is a complete lack of precision as to what the national interest test is. "It's a pity that we don't have the investment framework in this country to give the same sort of encouragement and the same level playing field for local investors."He said Australia should look across the Tasman Sea when reviewing rules surrounding foreign investment."The problem with our legislation as it now stands is there is a complete lack of precision as to what the national interest test is," he said."There isn't that lack of precision in New Zealand, where the national interest is spelled out much more clearly in a way that is fair for both sides of the fence."
