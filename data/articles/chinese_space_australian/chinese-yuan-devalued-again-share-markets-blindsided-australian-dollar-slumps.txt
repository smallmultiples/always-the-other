Chinese officials have blindsided markets by pushing their national currency dramatically down for the second day in a row.On Wednesday the Australian dollar and share market slumped after the People's Bank of China (PBoC) set the yuan fixing at 6.3306 against the US dollar, which is 1.6 per cent weaker than at the previous day's close. It came after the bank on Tuesday slashed the value of the currency by an unprecedented 1.8 per cent, the first such devaluation since 2005 when China unpegged the yuan. On Tuesday, Chinese authorities had described the devaluation as a one-off, and the follow-up move has rattled markets across the region."Yesterday (Tuesday) the market was prepared to give the PBoC the benefit of the explanation that the yuan ... had appreciated at too rapid a rate, hence trade activity was suffering and the growth slowdown was too rapid," wrote TD Securities Asia-Pacific economist Annette Beacher."Now, we have the right to question yesterday's declaration that the fix to 6.2298 was a 'one-off depreciation'."Aggressively devaluing the currency is part of Beijing's efforts to stimulate the economy and exports, which dropped an unexpected 8.3 per cent in the year to July. The move stripped another half a cent from the Australian dollar, which was down to 72.6 US cents at 3:46pm (AEST) on Wednesday.The Australian share market fell steeply on the PBoC's surprise second move.The benchmark ASX 200 entered a correction, closing 1.7 per cent lower at 5,382, and the broader All Ordinaries fell 90 points to 5,384.Mining stocks in particular were hammered following the announcement, with Rio Tinto closing down 5.4 per cent, also hurt by trading without rights to its latest $1.45 dividend payment.BHP Billiton was 4.3 per cent lower and Fortescue lost 8 per cent.Will Australian property face a wave of capital if Chinese residents holding yuan feel that the end investment is appreciating at a fast rate? However, the declines spread across the share market, with ANZ and NAB down 1.9 and 2 per cent and Westpac down 1.4 per cent.Woolworths and Wesfarmers were down 2.8 and 1.2 per cent respectively and Telstra was down 1.1 per cent.IG Markets chief market strategist Chris Weston said resources companies are being hit particularly hard because they export products to China sold in US dollars."Australian businesses exporting to mainland China have seen the price of goods up (in Australian dollar terms) around 1 per cent on the week - this is even more pronounced if the product you export is priced in US dollars," he wrote in a note.Mr Weston said the Chinese currency depreciation could also have deeper ramifications for Australia's economy, including the housing market."One per cent doesn't sound like a lot, but if the Chinese yuan continues to weaken, then how will this impact Chinese investment abroad?" he questioned."Will Australian property face a wave of capital if Chinese residents holding yuan feel that the end investment is appreciating at a fast rate? Buy sooner would be the mindset."Shanghai stocks were also hit and the market was down 1.2 per cent in early trade, before pulling back to a more modest 0.4 per cent decline later on Wednesday afternoon.An array of official data out Wednesday revealed a further deterioration in China's economic performance, with industrial production, fixed asset investment and retail sales all falling well short of market expectations.Industrial production slowed substantially from an annual growth rate of 6.8 per cent in June to 6 per cent last month.Economists had predicted industrial production would have grown at closer to 6.6 per cent.It is difficult to detect any sense of crisis, maybe because the government seems to be more successful in generating jobs than in generating increases in GDP. Fixed asset investment, which had only recently edged up after a number of weak readings, turned back down to a growth rate of 11.2 per cent, the lowest level for more than 10 years.It is a key reading for the Chinese economy's future growth prospects as it includes spending on infrastructure, factory equipment and property construction.Retail sales were also softer than expected, growing at 10.5 per cent in July compared to 10.6 per cent in June and well below the long term average of 14 per cent growth recorded over the past five years.A research note from Citi published earlier this week forecast further stimulus measures from Chinese authorities, with five provinces believed to have shrinking economies."There is a widespread acknowledgement of the economy's weakness, and three resource-oriented provinces in north-east China - Liaoning, Jilin and Helongjiang â€“ are thought to be in recession already, along with north China's Hebei and Shanxi provinces," the analysts wrote.However, they noted that slowing Chinese growth had not translated to surging unemployment."It is difficult to detect any sense of crisis, maybe because the government seems to be more successful in generating jobs than in generating increases in GDP: 7.2 million jobs were created in the first half of 2015, which sits comfortably with the full-year target of 10 million," they explained."Perhaps this dichotomy between job creation and growth helps to explain why the rest of the world seems more panicked about China than China does."The bold currency move signalled China was seriously committed to "floating" its currency as it outlined in a statement on Tuesday.Chinese authorities maintain strict controls on the currency, allowing it to trade only within a 2 per cent range of the daily reference rate.But they are starting to relax their rules in an effort to have it included in the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) basket of reserve currencies. The IMF in a statement welcomed the moves to free up the yuan. "It should allow market forces to have a greater role in determining the exchange rate," the statement said."Greater exchange rate flexibility is important for China as it strives to give market forces a decisive role in the economy and is rapidly integrating into global financial markets."The IMF said it believed China could and should aim to have an effectively floating currency within three years.
