Amid all the drama in Canberra this week, you could be forgiven for missing the news that Chinese tech giant Huawei will be excluded from participating in Australia's 5G mobile network. Intelligence officials have been concerned for some time that allowing Huawei to help build the network would create national security risks.In a statement issued on Thursday, the Government said companies "likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government that conflict with Australian law" would likely be unable to participate in the next generation network. Analysts have long suggested that Huawei — as a private Chinese company — is obligated under Chinese law to assist authorities with "state intelligence work".On Friday, Huawei — who said it will not comment further on the matter this week — criticised the decision in a statement provided to the ABC as "politically motivated" while noting that it intends to "protect [its] legal rights"."The Australian Government's actions undermine the principles of competition and non-discrimination in fair trade," it said."We will continue to engage with the Australian Government, and in accordance with Australian law and relevant international conventions, we will take all possible measures to protect our legal rights and interests."China's foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang meanwhile accused Australia of attempting to "erect artificial hurdles" and "enforce discriminatory measures".As you might expect, the announcement was not well-received by the Chinese press either.A series of fairly robust articles and editorials in the state-owned Global Times tabloid have accused Australia of "stabbing Huawei in the back", and violating its free trade obligations."Those who wilfully hurt Chinese companies with an excuse of national security will meet their nemesis," one editorial said.So was the decision at odds with Australia's free trade obligations? And what's next for the company's Australian operations and its 700-plus employees now that the ban has been confirmed? Andrew Godwin, an associate director of the University of Melbourne's Asian Law Centre, said there were substantial legal and treaty obstacles that would make it difficult for Huawei to take action against the Government.This is because the company is likely to be blocked from participating in the 5G network on security grounds, which is a valid defence under both the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the China-Australia free trade agreements."The WTO agreements in relation to goods and services recognise a security exception, under which states are allowed to take action to protect their essential security interests," he said."The term 'security interests' is not defined. From a practical perspective, it is therefore up to states themselves to determine their security interests."The United States for instance used this line of argument when it increased its tariffs on steel and aluminium. Professor Godwin said while Australia's decision might be legal, that doesn't mean the broader bilateral trade relationship will emerge unscathed.This concern was echoed by the Australia China Business Council's national CEO, Helen Sawczak."Bilateral trade is a two-way street. If we want Australian companies to prosper in the Chinese market, then we should also treat Chinese companies with respect and transparency when they operate in the Australian market," she told the ABC."While business remains positive about the opportunities which this important economic relationship offers, it can be challenging to conduct business when the political relationship is strained." However, telecommunications analyst David Kennedy from Ovum said he did not expect Huawei to take any steps "that would compromise their position in the market".The Government's decision this week may ban Huawei from participating in the 5G network, causing a setback for future plans on Australian shores, but the company's interests in 4G and enterprise technologies will remain unaffected."They need to ensure there isn't mission creep [a shift in intentions] in the way that this ban actually might expand," Mr Kennedy said."There's still a lot of 4G investment and development happening in Australia over the next few years and they would want to have a role in that market." However, the future of mobile internet technology worldwide is 5G, and there are concerns about how Huawei's exclusion may affect Australia's network.Vodafone's chief strategy officer Dan Lloyd said the decision "fundamentally undermines Australia's 5G future."Mr Kennedy said Huawei was considered to be the price-setter globally when it came to 5G network technology, and taking them out of the picture could drive costs up."The cost of rolling out 5G in Australia will be higher than it otherwise would have been, I don't see any way that you can avoid that conclusion," he said."It all flows through to the consumer in due course."
