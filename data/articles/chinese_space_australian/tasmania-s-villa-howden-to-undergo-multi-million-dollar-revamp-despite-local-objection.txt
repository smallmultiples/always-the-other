A multi-million-dollar expansion of the Villa Howden accommodation and function centre in Tasmania's south has been approved by the state's planning authority.Chinese investor William Wei, who owns the Australian Travel and Culture Group, purchased Villa Howden near the township of Howden in 2017 for $2.6 million.Mr Wei's plan to extend the building from 10 rooms to 52 and add a new dining area and bar was approved by the Kingborough Council in February, against the advice of its own officers.Local residents Robert and Robyn Pearshouse and Katherine Butorac lodged an appeal against the approval in the Resource Management and Planning Appeal Tribunal.The Tribunal upheld the council's approval this week."There's a limited amount of accommodation the Kingborough and Channel area," building designer Marco Linardi said. "The beauty of this site is it is an isolated, well-hidden site. Our nearest neighbour is about 180 metres away," he said."So it's going to be well-hidden even though it's an additional 36 suites."The residents argued the development would not fit with the low-density rural character of the area."We're very disappointed with the decision," local resident Robert Pearshouse said.He said it was a "massive development" at odds with local development guidelines."The style of the building is also a medieval, Tuscan, Moroccan-inspired villa. How that fits with the current characteristics of a bushland suburb of Howden is â€¦ absolutely amazing."The tribunal found none of the grounds of the appeal were made out."There is neither a unified character nor a consistent pattern of land use in the area, and the scale of the proposal simply cannot be said to be at odds with either or both," it said in its decision. "There will be very limited views of [the development] from or even near adjoining dwellings or neighbouring properties."Mr Pearshouse said the residents had other concerns about the project, including its environmental, wastewater and noise impact, but could not afford to appeal on additional grounds."We were very limited in the grounds that we could take to the tribunal because of funding, and the incredible costs that have to be outlaid to run such appeals," Mr Pearshouse said."So while we gave it our best shot on some grounds, there were a number of grounds that we couldn't even raise."He said the group was considering appealing to the Supreme Court.Mr Linari said the approval cleared the way for the project to go ahead."We're hoping to see the development move ahead in the near future," Mr Linardi said.
