All Labor conferences matter, but this one will matter more than most.It matters to Bill Shorten, who has to convince his party he has what it takes to lead.It matters because the election is a touch over a year away and Labor has to emerge with an agenda that appeals to more than just the party's base.And it matters because there are serious policy debates afoot and the numbers are tight.This time the party's right does not dominate the list of nearly 400 delegates.There is roughly a 50-50 split between Left and Right and working out how the numbers will fall is complicated by the fact that not every vote will follow factional lines.On some issues, like border protection, the view of most of the parliamentary party is harder than that of other delegates.On taking another step towards the recognition of Palestine, the NSW Right and Left are united and staunchly opposed by the Victorian Right.Some fights, like border protection, are essentially defensive — parliamentary hard heads want the maximum room to move in Government.On climate change the position is offensive — Labor believes that the community is ahead of the Government on this and so it is pushing a more ambitious (if aspirational) goal.In the end, no matter how vigorous the debate, Labor has to emerge from the weekend looking united and in good shape to fight an election. That starts at the top.Apart from a few political junkies, the public will not tune in to the conference. The critical audience is the party. Mr Shorten needs to show the true believers he can carry their cause.Much has been made about his capacity to lead and there will be many doubters in the room.How he performs over the next three days will be one of the main talking points among delegates and observers.Acres of newsprint have been expended on measuring the contest between Mr Shorten and the Prime Minister, but there is one key difference to keep in mind.Tony Abbott has spent 21 years in Parliament, six years as Liberal leader and is approaching two as Prime Minister. The public has made up its mind about him.By comparison, Mr Shorten has been in Parliament five years and Opposition Leader for two. Mr Shorten might find it galling but most people still do not have a clear sense of who he is.So while he now polls badly, there is still time for him to change that. Whether he does or not is up to him, so the next three days carry both risk and opportunity.As far as the issues go, none poses a greater risk for Mr Shorten's chances of becoming prime minister than how he goes about controlling the borders.Few things generate as much internal anger as Labor's ever-hardening stance on asylum seekers. But it is wrong to define this as simply as a battle between a Left that wants a softer line and a Right that wants to hold the line.Some in the Right find the idea of turn-backs and off-shore detention hard to stomach and some in the Left believe both are essential, no matter how distasteful they find it. Many in the parliamentary party's Left were mugged by the reality of government. Then Labor conducted a real world experiment, softening the hard-line, Howard-era Pacific Solution.Asylum seekers came in their hundreds and then thousands, more than 1,000 drowned, and an increasingly panicked Labor gradually replaced almost every brick in the Pacific Solution wall.Few parliamentarians who lived through that experience want to revisit it.A fight was always looming on this so Mr Shorten and immigration spokesman Richard Marles made a pre-emptive strike on Thursday, announcing that a future Labor government wants the option of boat turn-backs.They also admitted that softening the Pacific Solution was a mistake. Mr Shorten will detail his immigration policy at the conference and, as a peace offering, say he aspires to meet the platform's call for a refugee intake of 27,000.But the announcement will only supercharge what was always going to be one of the most heated conference debates.Expect a move to amend Labor's platform to explicitly rule out the option of boat turn-backs and detention on Manus Island and Nauru as options for a future Labor government.Many in the parliamentary party will be hoping the platform simply remains silent on both, leaving maximum flexibility in government.The unions are up in arms about the labour clauses in the Chinese Free Trade deal and Mr Shorten has decided to back them.He is penning an article in The Australian saying that the China agreement "undermines safeguards for jobs" because it allows unrestricted access to the Australian labour market by Chinese workers.Unions are also concerned that the investor state dispute resolution mechanism will allow Chinese companies to sue the Australian Government if they make a loss on investments.The Government said this was bunk and has decried the push as racist and xenophobic. It said it showed Mr Shorten is hostage to the party's industrial wing.The risk in this is that Mr Shorten gets tagged as a throwback to a very murky Labor past.Fear of cheap Chinese labour undermining Australia's high-wage workforce is as old as Labor itself.That said, the unions' concern that exporting Chinese labour is part of China's trade strategy is an issue that might well resonate with a much broader audience.No matter what Labor decides at the conference, the Government was always going to run a campaign saying its policy choices will drive up electricity costs.So it is a show of confidence that Labor plans to embrace an aspirational renewable energy target of 50 per cent by 2030.The party leadership clearly believes that the public is open to change, but details on how it will be achieved, and what it will cost, are scant so it comes with large risks.Some MPs are concerned that if Labor missteps on the policy, or the sales job, they will relive yet another traumatic event from the Rudd-Gillard years.The bitter history on this does not fill them with confidence that they can win round three. The battle to get same-sex marriage into the party's platform was won in 2012, in the face of opposition from then prime minister Julia Gillard.The compromise was a caveat that MPs and senators got a conscience vote when the matter came to Parliament.That does not sit well with some, like deputy leader Tanya Plibersek, who wants to make the platform position binding.There is a push to move an amendment but the risks if it succeeds are great — some MPs and senators would simply ignore it and dare the party to expel them.The other point, routinely raised by some in the Right, is the obvious disconnect of arguing that the Coalition should allow a conscience vote while ruling it out for Labor.Buried deep in the platform is an objective, penned in 1921, that commits Labor to "the democratic socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange, to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features in these fields".Many believe this relic needs to be replaced with a more 21st century statement of what the party is trying to achieve.But the attempt to change it may fall at the first hurdle, as no one has a clear idea what it should be changed to.Mr Shorten wants to push along the idea of Australia becoming a Republic and a motion is planned to provide a road map on how to get there.Mr Shorten raised the notion in March in a debate on the rules governing the order of royal succession.I and Labor believe it's time, it's time to breathe new life into the dream of an Australian republic. He said as a multicultural nation, Australia now no longer saw the relevance of the royals, even if it admired the Queen."I and Labor believe it's time, it's time to breathe new life into the dream of an Australian republic," he said.The proposal for doing that is to pass a motion committing a future Labor government to making a minister responsible for getting the public excited about constitutional reform.Canvassing party members about their key issues going into conference this one barely rated a mention.In 2014, NSW Labor adopted a resolution on recognising a Palestinian state.It said that if "there is no progress to a two-state solution, and Israel continues to build and expand settlements, a future Labor government will consult like-minded nations towards recognition of the Palestinian state".It might seem like a small step, but it is a big deal for some and is furiously opposed by the diminishing band of ardently pro-Israel Labor MPs and senators.Expect a similar resolution to be debated, and probably passed, at the conference.What is intriguing about this fight is that it is not a Left-Right divide. It is a NSW resolution, supported by both factions in that state.It will be vigorously opposed by the Victorian Right, which happens to be Mr Shorten's power base.One side-effect of Labor's growing embrace of a Palestinian state is that it is losing donations and support from the Jewish lobby, a group that once staunchly backed Labor.A push is on for change in Australia's oldest party across a number of fronts.There will be moves to make progress on affirmative action, with Mr Shorten backing a proposal to ensure women make up 50 per cent of the party's MPs by 2025.There is also a plan to change the way conference delegates are selected and to give rank and file members a 50 per cent say in the way Senate candidates are pre-selected.Some in Labor's Right oppose the changes because they fear they are already seeing the result in a drift of the party to the Left.NSW MP Stephen Jones has flagged setting up a federal anti-corruption watchdog and it has won some support.The cause has been championed by the Transport Workers' Union and it is expected to push the idea at the conference.It does not excite everyone, as Labor hardly did well out of the NSW version of the watchdog and there are legitimate concerns about the way that body conducts its business.Those concerns clearly stretched all the way to the High Court, with the NSW Commission having its wings clipped in a high-profile case of quasi-judicial over-reach.So, if you are obsessed by policy and politics, there is no better place to be than in Melbourne's convention centre for the next three days.It is easy to scoff that this is no more than a stage-managed talkfest and that it is meaningless because the parliamentary Labor Party no longer sees the platform as holy writ; nut politics is about the battle of ideas, good and bad.No other party has a public ideas forum like this; long may it prosper.
