About one-third of large companies have failed to pay tax, even though they made a gross profit, but the Tax Office says most have good reasons, according to the latest corporate tax transparency report released today.Of the 2,109 entities monitored by the ATO in data covering 2016-17, 66 per cent paid tax although the remainder did not as they claimed tax losses and concessions that can go back several years."While the majority of entities in the corporate transparency population made profits and paid tax in relation to the 2016-17 year, some do not pay tax," the transparency report said."We look to understand the reason for tax losses or nil tax payable. Sensitivity to economic conditions, reinvestment back into the business, distribution of profits to other entities within the broader group, tax deductions and tax offsets can all affect the amount of taxable income and tax payable."The ATO said total corporate income tax collected in the period lifted by 19 per cent to $45.7 billion, which is $7.5 billion up on the prior period, in part because of an additional 68 entities being taxed.ATO commissioner Jeremy Hirschhorn said the crackdown on multinational tax avoidance had begun to emerge in the latest data as companies restructure their tax affairs to stay within the law. "In coming years, the full effect of the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law (MAAL) will flow through as multinational companies book billions more in sales locally," Mr Hirschhorn said."The report also reflects restructures made to avoid paying the diverted profits tax and increased compliance with country to country reporting."Despite the improved tax revenue, Mr Hirschhorn said the ATO would not hold back in ensuring corporations pay their fair share of tax."While economic conditions may change from year to year, the data shows the ATO has strong and continuous scrutiny on Australia's largest taxpayers, as the community would expect," Mr Hirschhorn said."There will be no lessening of the ATO's commitment to ensuring large corporate taxpayers are paying the correct amount of tax."We continue to monitor the market and release advice and guidance on issues in real-time as they arise, as well as maintaining real-time engagement with all large taxpayers."The transparency report covers 1,721 Australian and foreign owned companies with an income of $100 million or more plus 388 Australian private companies making in excess of $200 million.The increased tax take was driven by the mining, energy and water industries, reflecting a broad recovery in commodity prices.Australian public entities contributed $6.4 billion to the increase, followed by $626 million from foreign-owned companies, while Australian private entities contributed $429 million.The report noted that about 81 per cent of Australian private entities are linked to groups controlled by "wealthy individuals, including high wealth individuals", with 11,000 linked companies, trusts, partnerships and superannuation funds.The ATO also said there has been greater compliance with the Petroleum Resources Rent Tax (PRRT) which shows 98 per cent was paid voluntarily, up by $100 million to $946 million in the period.On Thursday the ATO also revised lower its theoretical estimate of how much tax is owed by large corporates with more than $250 million turnover.It said it had changed its methodology and estimated that the large corporate tax gap for 2015-16 was about $1.8 billion, or 4.4 per cent of the tax payable for this group. Last year the ATO reported the tax gap was about $2.5 billion for 2014-15, but has revised its estimates lower this year."The gap primarily reflects differences in the interpretation of complex areas of tax law," the ATO said in a statement."The large corporate groups income tax gap has been decreasing in recent years, coinciding with improvements we've made to our methodology to increase the accuracy of our estimates."The ATO said the PRRT tax gap was about $18 million in 2015-16. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said its budget funding for the Tax Avoidance Taskforce targeting multinationals had "enabled the ATO to expand a program that ensures a faster and more intensive approach to tax compliance for the largest 1,000 public and multinational groups.""Ensuring corporate taxpayers pay their fair share of tax helps us to provide tax relief for individuals and small and family businesses, and the essential services that Australians rely on."But shadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh said the data showed 722 out of 2,109 companies paid no tax."Australians don't want the world's biggest tax loopholes, they want the best schools and hospitals," he said.Oxfam Australia chief executive Dr Helen Szoke said it was an "unjust reality" that one-in-three large companies paid not a single cent of tax in 2016-17."So long as the Government refuses to take necessary, tougher measures on tax transparency and the hidden owners of companies and trusts to further crack down on tax avoidance, large companies will continue to get away with not paying their fair share of taxes," she said."This practice is fuelling poverty and inequality, not just in Australia, but around the world."The Tax Justice Network's Mark Zirnsak said foreign-owned multinational corporations made up 36 per cent of the corporate income in Australia but only generated 18 per cent of reportable profits. "This points to some of these corporations being more aggressive in their tax arrangements to avoid paying tax in Australia, or anywhere for that matter," he said.GetUp campaigns director Ruby-Rose O'Halloran said the ATO data showed successive governments have failed to deal with corporate tax cheats."Politicians are surely failing us when nurses, teachers, retail and hospitality workers are all contributing more to society than some of the world's largest corporations," she said. "It's simply not fair."But the Tax Institute's senior tax counsel Robert Deutsch pointed out some good news in the data, which is that the gap between what the ATO thinks it should be receiving and what it is collecting is falling."These figures are the lowest they have been since measurements first began â€” both in percentage and dollar terms."The Business Council of Australia, which represents large companies, said that big firms are paying almost two-thirds of the company tax collected."It is pleasing to see that compliance amongst large companies has increased to over 95 per cent with the vast majority of tax paid voluntarily," said the BCA's chief executive Jennifer Westacott."This data shows the tax gap has fallen around $200 million to just $1.8 billion."KPMG's director of tax governance services Phil Beswick said boards and management of companies should consider voluntarily offering more detailed information about their tax affairs.
