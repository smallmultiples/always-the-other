Industry has joined a chorus of criticism over the details of Australia's free trade agreement with China.Trade unions claim the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement (FTA) will allow Chinese workers to replace Australian workers on major construction jobs, and Labor has vowed to scrutinise legislation in Parliament to ensure that does not happen.Now, a major industry group has voiced concern about the lack of transparency in the trade negotiations.Innes Willox, chief executive of the Australian Industry Group (Ai Group), which represents manufacturers, has warned the secrecy surrounding the agreement makes it difficult to tell what its impact will be.Despite a decade of negotiations and a formal announcement last year, the final terms of the China-Australia free trade deal are only now emerging."We have strong concerns about the lack of real consultation that occurs between negotiators and industry," Mr Willox told 7.30. "There hasn't been enough consultations and it's only after the agreement has been signed that we can see the real fallout."Have we seen enough detail? Well, we're still all sifting through the detail of the agreement and that's unfortunate."While the Ai Group said it supported the principals of a free trade agreement, the union movement is actively campaigning against the China agreement.National secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union (AMWU) Tim Ayers said it would pave the way for companies to import cheap labour from overseas."$150 million projects with less than 15 per cent of Chinese investment can access new provisions, new flexibility to bring in Chinese labour," Mr Ayers told 7.30."That's a massive threat to Australian jobs. It is a real threat to competitiveness, good skills and good jobs in the construction industry."The unions said companies like construction giant John Holland — which built Parliament House, the Melbourne Cricket Ground and much of the country's major infrastructure, and is now 100 per cent Chinese owned — will be able to exploit clauses in the agreement to import their own cheaper, Chinese labour.The claim has been flatly denied by the parliamentary secretary for Trade and Investment, Steve Ciobo, who said the Government must first approve any use of foreign labour."The project agreement stipulates that they must use domestic workers - in other words, they've got to use Australians first," Mr Ciobo said. "So, Australians actually have the priority, and have the preference, in terms of these agreements."Australians must be used where possible, and it's only if there's a shortfall of skilled Australian workers that they then would look at being able to top that up with workers from abroad."Mr Ciobo said the unions were playing the race card."The trade union movement and, unfortunately, Bill Shorten, the Labor Party, think they're onto a political winner here, they think it's easy to stir up trouble in relation to China," he said.Tim Ayres defended his position and said he was simply taking the side of Australian workers."Tony Abbott has decided that he'll be on the side of Chinese industry and Chinese jobs and not the Australian construction industry and Australian construction workers," Mr Ayres said.The Ai Group said it did not believe local employment would suffer."From what we can tell, Chinese workers are not going to get any greater advantage than workers from anywhere else in the world," Mr Willox said."They'll still need to meet language requirements and skills requirements, and that's the important message."Any FTA is going to have winners and losers, depending on how companies are set up."
