There has been another night of heavy selling on Wall Street and in Europe, as investor worries about Chinese economic growth intensify.In New York, the S&P 500 closed down 3 per cent (58 points) at 1,914.Bluechip stocks fared better, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 2.8 per cent (470 points) to 16,058.The catalyst for the falls was the same as the Australian share market's losses yesterday: weak Chinese manufacturing data.The data showed factory activity in China contracted in August at its fastest pace in three years.US figures released overnight indicated activity also slowed in American factories last month.The recent market volatility prompted the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, to warn global growth is likely to be weaker than previously expected."The Chinese economy is adjusting to a new growth model. Growth is slowing, but not sharply and not unexpectedly," she said in a speech at the University of Indonesia in Jakarta."The transition to a more market-based economy and the unwinding of risks built up in recent years is complex and could well be somewhat bumpy."Energy stocks were unable to provide the market with any support.Having rallied in recent sessions, oil prices fell sharply, with West Texas crude dropping nearly 8 per cent to $US45.33 a barrel.Across the Atlantic, European indices broadly matched Wall Street's losses.The Euro Stoxx index closed down 2.5 per cent (81 points) at 3,189 and the German DAX fell 2.4 per cent (244 points) to 10,016.The FTSE 100 in London dropped just over 3 per cent (189 points) to 6,059.The weak Chinese data also weighed on the Australian dollar, putting the currency on the brink of falling below 70 US cents for the first time since 2009.At 7:30am the dollar was buying around 70.1 US cents, 62 euro cents, 45.8 British pence and 83.7 Japanese yen.Spot gold was at $US1,140 an ounce.
