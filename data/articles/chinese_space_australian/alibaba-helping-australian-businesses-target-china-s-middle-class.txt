A host of Australian companies are increasingly selling products to a lucrative Chinese middle class hungry for high-quality health, supplements, food and cosmetics products through global conglomerate Alibaba, which provides e-commerce platforms for the hard-to-reach market.China's middle class is expected to grow to 800 million people by 2030, and consumption is expected to accelerate alongside it.According to Sydney University, China is Australia's second largest market for pharmaceuticals, with exports totalling $381 million in 2013-2014, including vitamins and health products."Any type of product in health and nutrition is very desirable in that country as well as this country," said Mario Tascone, chief operating officer at Chemist Warehouse, which operates an online store on Alibaba's shopping site Tmall.com."We don't look at promoting brands that are going to be popular in China and second guess what the Chinese market does." Chemist Warehouse sells a variety of vitamins, cosmetics and health products on Tmall, and reached a record $2 million in sales in the first 46 minutes of trade on China's Singles Day last year."For us it's this local market and what Australian consumers want, because nine times out of ten whatever Australian consumers want it flows on over there, that's what we've found in our experience."Alibaba is worth $US157.7 billion, according to Forbes, and had the biggest US IPO in history, raising $US21.8 billion.Later this year, the company will open its first Australian office in Melbourne in an effort to extend its reach Down Under.The conglomerate has already formed partnerships with Woolworths and in May 2014 signed a deal with Australia Post to connect Australian consumers with Chinese manufacturers while at the same time boosting Chinese consumption of Australian products.Demand for Australian products has also been spurred by the rise of 'daigou' or buying agents, effectively a Chinese person overseas who purchases goods for a customer back home in China.Mr Tascone said the company had seen a rise in tourists buying stock off shelves because of the lower price."The future for us is making sure we can co-exist in China and get products to that market but, all the while, making sure we don't miss our supply chain to what made us where we are today and that's the local customers," he said.Tmall currently features 1,300 Australian brands, 80 per cent of which entered China for the first time through its platforms.Maggie Zhou, managing director of Alibaba's Australia and New Zealand division, told reporters at a media briefing that not everything sells well in China."You need to find the right products, and then you'll sell very well. But if the product is not right, you cannot be successful," she said."Price, what kind of right price is also very important. If you have several channels you need to manage the price very well, otherwise it would be chaos."
