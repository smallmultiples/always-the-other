A Uyghur Australian man who fears for the safety of his wife and son is calling on the nation's diplomats to help them get out of China to avoid persecution. The man, who cannot be named for security reasons, successfully made an urgent application to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) late last year to have his son recognised as an Australian citizen.Originally the Department of Home Affairs rejected his application for citizenship for his child, but the AAT overturned that decision just before Christmas.The child was formally granted Australian citizenship in early February. The Australian father has not been able to see his wife, who is also a Uyghur, since before she gave birth to their son at the end of August 2017, after he travelled to Australia to earn money for the family.The man's only contact with his family and young son has been via Chinese messaging platform "WeChat".He claimed a visa application to visit his family was knocked back by Chinese officials, and said his wife had been told their son would be taken away from her and adopted out to a Han Chinese family after he turned one.The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) said they were "providing consular assistance to an Australian man whose family are in China" but would not comment further, citing privacy obligations.Australia has become increasingly concerned about the vast network of re-education camps which the Chinese Government has established in the western province of Xinjiang.  Australia estimates around 1 million ethnic Muslims are being held in forced detention, although the figure is difficult to verify. Last year DFAT officials told a Senate estimates committee that three Australian citizens had been held in Chinese camps. But activists in the local Uyghur community say 17 Australian residents are still being detained by China in Xinjiang, and have pleaded with the Coalition to intensify lobbying on their behalf. The man appealing to the AAT said he met his wife in October 2015 during a trip to Urumqi, and they were married in religious ceremony in August the following year.They honeymooned in the United States, before visiting Turkey where the man's sister lives. That is where the wife fell pregnant. He went to Australia while his wife returned to China to be closer to her family.He claimed that shortly after his wife arrived, her travel documents were confiscated.His wife and son have already spent time in a re-education camp, he claimed.
