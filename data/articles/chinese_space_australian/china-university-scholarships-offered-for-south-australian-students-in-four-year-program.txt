A scholarships program will give a handful of South Australian tertiary students a chance to study in China.The State Government will spend $200,000 over four years on the program.Five scholarships per year will be offered for students to study at universities in Shandong province, which is South Australia's sister state.SA Higher Education Minister Gail Gago is in China to announce details of the scholarships and said Shandong officials were considering reciprocal scholarships for Chinese students to study in Adelaide."These exchanges not only add to our cultural diversity but they also boost our economy by expanding exports and also very valuable tourism opportunities," she said."Our state is already a popular one for Chinese students - 40 per cent of our international students in 2013 came from China - and we would like to open our doors to even more."I will have the opportunity to talk with government and educational leaders about the best means of collaboration, including student exchanges."Ms Gago said she was keen to learn more about the Chinese education system as part of South Australia's efforts to position the state as a leading higher education destination for Chinese students."International engagement is a key focus of our Government's economic vision and we continue to build a stronger relationship with Shandong in the 28 years since our sister state agreement was first signed," she said.The Minister also will discuss trade and investment partnerships with a view to South Australian technology companies setting up Chinese subsidiaries.
