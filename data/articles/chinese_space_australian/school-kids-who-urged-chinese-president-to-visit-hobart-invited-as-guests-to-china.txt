Grade 6 students from Tasmania who wrote to Chinese president Xi Jinping have been invited by him to visit China.The students from Launceston's Scotch Oakburn College met the president during his historic visit to Tasmania late last year.They had written him letters in Mandarin explaining to him why he should visit Tasmania.The president met the students when he spent a day in Hobart after the G20 summit in Brisbane last November.School principal Andy Muller said the students were still coming to terms with the top-level invitation."I think the students understand that this is a big moment, and they understand that it is a huge opportunity and it's very exciting," he said."But to actually be invited by the president of China, I'm not sure that any of us realise here in Australia quite how big it is.I'm not sure that any of us realise here in Australia quite how big it is. "Well over a billion people basically treat him as well almost a deity and I don't think we have that understanding of the reverence with which he is held and (what) a personal invitation would therefore bring."The students are preparing by swotting up on China and learning some songs in Mandarin. "An understanding of the culture of other peoples from around the world is very important especially when you come from a more regional area like Launceston," Mr Muller said.Eleven-year-old Connor O'Sign said the students were "a bit shocked" when they heard."We also had a good laugh because when we were coming back from meeting him in Hobart we all said on the bus, 'oh it would be amazing if we could go to China'," he said.The students are looking forward to seeing the sights, including visiting pandas."One of my favourite things which I've always wanted to do is see the Great Wall, so we're able to do that and also go to the schools in China because it's going to be amazing to see how different it is from our school." Mr Muller said the visit would also further enhance the state's links with China. "More broadly for the state, it just further enhances that connection we've got with China form the Tasmanian perspective," he said."We see our premier has met now with president Xi three times in six months and I don't think there is anyone else around the world who has met with him as many times in such a short period of time."Mr Xi was first invited to Tasmania as governor of Fujian province in the 1980s when Tasmania became a sister state, and again in 2013 when he rose to the Chinese presidency.During an address to the Australian Parliament in November Mr Xi said the letter describing Tasmania's unique products and scenery had "filled him with curiosity".The 22 students will be guests of the Chinese government for a six-day visit to Beijing in May.As well as taking in the usual sights, the students will visit a sister school in Beijing, which had been attended by the president's daughter.The school hopes the visit will result in more student and staff exchanges.
