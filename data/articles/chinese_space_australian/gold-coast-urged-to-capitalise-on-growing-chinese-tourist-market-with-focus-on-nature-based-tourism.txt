An authority on relations between Australia and China says the Gold Coast is at risk of missing out on the growing Chinese tourist dollar.The Australian Chinese Relations Institute says Chinese tourists want to spend more time in nature during their holidays.The institute's professor James Laurenceson said the Gold Coast had a lot to offer but it might not be enough to keep up with demand."The number one thing that the Chinese tourists are looking for is nature-based attractions," he said."It doesn't get much better than the Gold Coast when it comes to nature-based attractions."The Gold Coast needs to get ready for this."These numbers are big - I understand that the Gold Coast already has a lot of hotels and tourists attractions but we need even more."Professor Laurenceson said about a million people from China were expected to visit the Gold Coast next year."What we are seeing on the Gold Coast at the moment is a very, very virtuous circle taking place," he said."So the Chinese tourists are coming. Chinese investors, property investors see that and they see it as a good area to go into so they start ploughing their dollars into building high-rises," he said."Now the airlines see this so they want a piece of the pie as well."Now they are offering direct flights from China into the Gold Coast."
