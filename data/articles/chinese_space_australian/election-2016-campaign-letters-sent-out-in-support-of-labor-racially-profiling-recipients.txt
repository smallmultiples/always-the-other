Recipients of campaign material supporting a Labor candidate say they have been racially profiled based on their surname.The material targets voters whose last names suggest they have an Asian background.The letter was sent by a local GP called Dr Stanley Chiang and in it he writes about his support for the Labor member for Batman, David Feeney, and encourages the Chinese Community to vote for him.Olivia Lim, a resident of Northcote Melbourne, said she received a letter this week, that had been sent to her home address and addressed to Mr and Mrs Lim."It was advising us how best to vote in the upcoming federal election based on that assumption that we were Chinese," she said.Ms Lim said the letter was sent in English and Mandarin."The problem with that is neither of us are Chinese, we're both Australian," she said."My husband is not Chinese either, he never has been, he was born in Malaysia, moved to Australia with his family and is an Australian citizen."When I first read the letter I guess I reacted by laughing, so I called a friend and I was saying, 'Oh look, you know this is really funny, I've just been racially profiled'. "And then I thought, 'Hang on, that's not so funny, I've just been racially profiled, someone has just made assumptions about me and the way I should or shouldn't vote based on my surname and based on the assumption of my ethnicity'."Ms Lim said she was upset someone would assume her ethnicity based on her surname."And then â€¦ that someone would assume that voters of that ethnicity are so simple that they cast their vote purely on race," she said.On social media, there are photos of Labor's David Feeney posing with Dr Chiang.The World Today contacted Dr Chiang who confirmed he had sent the letters.But he would not say why the Lims were sent a letter talking about the Chinese community, nor would he say whether Labor had provided him with names and addresses from the electoral roll.Ms Lim said she had no idea who Dr Chiang was before receiving his letter."I've never had anything to do with Dr Stanley [Chiang], I've never had any associations with the Labor Party," she said."I don't know who he is and where he got our details from. I don't know him at all."The World Today contacted the Labor Party, sending a list of questions to their campaign headquarters asking whether the letters were authorised or funded by Labor, and whether Labor had passed on electoral roll details to Dr Chiang.Labor replied by saying: "Like local community members and leaders around the country, Dr Chiang is clearly concerned about Malcolm Turnbull's cuts to heath and plans to privatise Medicare."It's unsurprising he's written to people in his local community to advocate for a strong local voice who will protect Medicare."Labor has so far refused to answer a follow-up question from the ABC asking if the party provided Dr Chiang with electoral roll information.Nick Karam, a voter in the New South Wales electorate of Blaxland also got in touch with The World Today, saying he believed his local Labor member, Jason Clare, wrote to him specifically on the basis of race."It's just about the Maronite nursing home, which is being upgraded or being developed, and it just says 'Maronite aged care update'," Mr Karam said."And one side of the letter is in English and the other side of the letter is in Arabic."Mr Karam said he believed it was racial profiling."I have no problem receiving material, it's always good to be updated and informed, I just have a problem with being targeted based on my surname, when I am actually a third-generation Australian, can't even really read Arabic and my dad is actually of Orthodox descent, not Maronite descent."
