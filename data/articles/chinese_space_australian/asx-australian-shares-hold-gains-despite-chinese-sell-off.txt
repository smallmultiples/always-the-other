Australian shares have held onto moderate gains in early afternoon trade, despite weaker-than-expected Chinese manufacturing figures leading to falls in Shanghai and Hong Kong.China's widely-watched official PMI - a key measure of manufacturing performance - fell more than expected to 49.4, a level that not only indicates the sector is contracting but also is also the fastest pace of contraction since 2012.That poor reading saw the main Chinese share market in Shanghai lose 1.8 per cent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lose 1 per cent by 2:33pm (AEDT).With the industrial sector in China continuing to struggle despite significant stimulus, IG market analyst Angus Nicholson said Chinese banks are likely to suffer from a large number of bad loans."What is becoming increasingly clear is that at some point soon in this cycle, China is going to have to recapitalise its banks just as it did at similar points in the 1990s and 2000s," he warned.China worries did see Australian stocks retreat from their best gains of the day - with the market up by more than 1 per cent for part of the session - but the ASX 200 remains solidly in the black.The benchmark index was up 0.6 per cent to 5,034, while the broader All Ordinaries was 29 points higher at 5,085.As the most China-dependant firms, the big miners fared worst.BHP Billiton was down 1.8 per cent to $15.07, while Rio Tinto was off 0.7 per cent.Woodside lost 5 cents to $27.90, despite oil prices strengthening considerably at the end of last week on the Bank of Japan's move to negative interest rates.The major banks were mixed, with ANZ up a very strong 1.4 per cent and NAB 0.3 per cent higher, but the Commonwealth Bank down 0.6 per cent and Westpac down 0.7 per cent.The supermarket giants were helping hold up the ASX indices, with Coles owner Wesfarmers up 1.3 per cent to $42.70 and Woolworths up 0.5 per cent.However, Bega Cheese was one of the biggest losers of the day, shedding 12 per cent to $6.21 after losing a key contract to supply Coles with cheese.
