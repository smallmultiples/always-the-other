Australian shares are expected to start their day with very little momentum — practically flat.The local market will not be following its usual lead from Wall Street as it was closed for the Martin Luther King Jr public holiday. The Australian dollar fell slightly to 71.58 US cents, 55.5 British pence and 62.94 euro cents at 7:20am (AEDT).Since early-December, Britain's currency has lifted by almost 4 per cent against the local dollar."The pound has been helped by ongoing optimism that a hard Brexit will be avoided on March 29," said NAB's head of foreign exchange strategy Ray Attrill.European markets closed mostly lower overnight over signs of slowing economic growth around the globe.Despite growing expectations that Brexit may not occur by the late-March deadline, British investors traded with caution — resulting in London's FTSE ending flat at 6,971.UK Prime Minister Theresa May has refused to rule out the prospect of a "no-deal" exit from the European Union.Paris' CAC index lost 0.2 per cent to 4,868, and Frankfurt's DAX fell 0.6 per cent to 11,136.China released its fourth-quarter (2018) GDP figures yesterday, showing that its economic growth had slowed to 6.4 per cent (since the December 2017 quarter).By calendar year, it was a 6.6 per cent expansion rate for the world's second biggest economy — its most sluggish rate since 1990.In recent years, China has generated almost a third of global growth. Increasing signs of weakness in its economy have fuelled worries about the world economy, and have dragged down profits for major companies including Apple."Our economists expect that the [Chinese] economy will likely slow further in January and February, but signs of this won't really become apparent until mid-March," said Deutsche Bank economist Phil Odonaghoe."Our team continues to expect real GDP growth to drop to 6.1 per cent in the first quarter and 5.9 per cent in the second quarter."They also expect the [Chinese] Government will respond with more significant policy easing in March, particularly in the property market, to stabilize growth in the second half."Market sentiment was not helped by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cutting its outlook for the global economy for the second time in three months, particularly due to weakness in Asian and European economies.The IMF revised its forecast slightly lower — with the world economy estimated to grow at 3.5 per cent this year, and 3.6 per cent in 2020.The slowing growth in China, and across the world, was partly due to the US-China trade war and the billions of dollars in tariffs they have imposed on each other.Meanwhile, the price of gold has fallen marginally to $US1,279.53 an ounce.Brent crude oil has risen slightly to $US62.80 a barrel.
