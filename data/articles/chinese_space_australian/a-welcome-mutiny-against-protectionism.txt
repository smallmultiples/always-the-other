The Government's proposal to deregulate the shipping and aviation industries and allow foreign companies to get in on the action is a very good move that will do away with some old-fashioned protectionism, writes Chris Berg.It's sometimes thought that the economic disputes that characterised the 1970s and '80s are finished. The debate over protectionism, for instance, has been displaced by more modern debates over inequality and the environment.Two issues raised by the Government in the last week show how untrue that is.On Wednesday, Warren Truss outlined the Government's plan to deregulate Australia's coastal shipping industry, and yesterday the Australian Financial Review reported the Government was considering opening up domestic air routes in the north to foreign airlines.I was critical of the Government last week for being reform-shy, but these proposals are very, very good. Both coastal shipping and airlines are governed by cabotage rights - a peculiar 19th century term that refers to the right to transport passengers and goods between two points within a single country.The issue here is whether foreign-registered or owned or crewed ships and planes have cabotage rights. For instance, can British Airways fly domestic routes in Australia? Under Australian law, only in emergencies. Are Chinese registered vessels allowed to ship goods between Brisbane and Sydney? Under highly regulated conditions designed to dissuade them from doing so.Australia's cabotage restrictions are protectionism by another name. They are restrictions on what economic activity foreign firms can conduct in Australia. And, as with any protectionist policy that limits competitive pressure, they raise costs to consumers and hinder economic growth.Let's start with coastal shipping.Over the last few decades, the number of Australian registered ships used in coastal shipping has been in a dramatic decline. In 1996 there were 75 Australian registered ships in the coastal trade. Truss told a conference last week that number was now just 15. This is mostly due to the heavy burden of Australian industrial relations laws that apply to maritime workers on Australian vessels.In 2008 a parliamentary committee declared the industry was in "crisis" and "many in the Australian maritime industry (believe) Australia would benefit from a revived and expanded coastal shipping sector". One of those voices, of course, was the Maritime Union of Australia, whose members were losing out from the decline of Australian coastal ships.So in 2012 the Gillard government passed a large package of reforms to the shipping industry that dramatically increased restrictions on what foreign vessels and foreign-crewed vessels could do in Australian waters.Anthony Albanese, then infrastructure minister, made plain the protectionist purpose of the reforms: "Australian vessels paying Australian wages and providing jobs to Australians will be given preference to carry Australian goods on the Australian coast."As the former Productivity Commission head, Gary Banks, pointed out at the time, the government admitted these reforms were "strictly inconsistent" with the principles of competition policy that have driven economic liberalisation for the last few decades.It's worth recalling that those competition policies were originally established by Paul Keating's Labor government. Labor now is, of course, opposed to any deregulation. For once that old commentary canard about the modern Labor Party having "betrayed the Hawke-Keating legacy" actually holds true.Like shipping, aviation has avoided the comprehensive liberalisations of the last few decades. Not many travellers pause to question why domestic air consists almost entirely of Qantas and Virgin. Australia is a rich country. Surely some foreign airlines might want a piece of the busy Melbourne-Sydney corridor?The Government's proposal to allow foreign airlines to fly domestic routes is limited to northern Australia. It's being sold as a "develop the north" strategy. But these sort of region-specific liberalisations are usually meant to be experimental tests for nation-wide reform. If airline deregulation works in the north - if it provides better, cheaper services - then there will be little reason not to roll it out across the country.Liberalisation is always accompanied by the bleatings of those whose privileges are being taken away. "Qantas and Virgin are fighting a rearguard action behind the scenes" against the proposal, one report said yesterday. More publicly, Albanese complains deregulation would be "unilateral economic disarmament".It's true that granting cabotage rights to foreign airlines is very rare around the world. But so what? Australia used to be a leader in market-oriented reform. A northern experiment would be good to prove these fears are nonsense.In a sense these proposed Abbott Government reforms feel like the calm before the storm. This is cabotage liberalisation by choice before cabotage liberalisation becomes a necessity.We are on the brink of an unpredictable yet certain revolutionary change in transport technology. Just as autonomous cars will challenge regulatory frameworks that assume every car has a driver, autonomous ships and autonomous planes will completely change the regulatory - and political - dynamic of these industries.It sounds all a bit cringingly futurist but the pilotless ships are already seen by Australian unions as a threat to cabotage protectionism. No labour costs means pilotless ships can travel slower, thereby using less fuel. This is good for cheap shipping and the environment.Likewise, when pilotless commercial aircraft become accepted, the old alliance between air services unions and airlines that underpins Labor's opposition to deregulation is going to break down.When this technological revolution occurs, limits on foreign firms operating in Australia are going to look like the 20th century anachronisms that they are.Chris Berg is a Senior Fellow with the Institute of Public Affairs.

No, really, it's a welfare state, propped up by federal money, subsidies, shipbuilding, cars and they are rubbish at it all. Like Tasmania, it's all input and no output.

They will never be as rich as their parents and grandparents.Just look at the UK where hundreds of thousands of poor who once had proper jobs now fight for menial jobs of 1 hour here, 3 hours there, via Internet sites. They have no security. They can't apply for house loans or car loans or credit cards. Even rentals are becoming out of their reach because they never get a payslip.Because Capitalism is now turning into day by day into tyranny.

26 May 2015 11:13:31amActually, large chunks of Australia started off as penal colonies. You don't get much more 'command economy' than that.And for a substantial part of the last two plus years Australia thrived on now unfashionable policies of protection all round. Unemployment, for instance, was lower in the 1950s and 1960s under centralised wage fixing than any time since the introduction of enterprise bargaining. If we were against protectionism in all it's forms and thought it a universal evil, the Government would tell the Reserve Bank to stop targeting a lower exchange rate via interest rate policies.

Alert moderator
26 May 2015 1:26:21pmThat's partly my point. A highly regulated wages system may not necessarily produce worse results than a fully de-regulated one. In fact, the evidence, albeit from  few years back now, suggests that either is preferable to a hybrid model where there's a mixture of regulation and free bargaining. Reason: a hybrid model tends raise the transaction costs of setting pay while limiting the effectiveness of price signals (to use the economics jargon) but does not guarantee equitable outcomes. Anyone familiar with pay negotiations inside the Australian Public Service will recognise these concerns.  The same limitations apply (to some degree) in other markets but the labour market has a number of unique characteristics that make a simple neo-classic analysis pretty inadequate.

By the time of the First World War Australia had one of the most efficient economies in the world.  It was also one of the fairest and we had one of the highest standards of living. To be sure there was private ownership of industries and businesses but they operated within the context of the social wage which ensured fair working conditions.There were however also many industries that were government owned and operated.  This was no laissez faire capitalist economy.  It was very much a mixed economy and served us well.

I earned money by purchasing flooring and then selling it and my labour to the client.  I would buy the flooring from the wholesaler and sell it to the client at about 10% less than the retail price on the condition I also did the installation work.  I still made around 20% on the flooring (retail markup can be 80% in some cases).The client got flooring at a better price than buying it themselves, I made some money plus kept myself employed as an installer.  I generated wealth and paid tax on it.  Nobody lost out that I can see except the retailers and they had room to move on price if they wanted.  And they have, since I quit doing it the SqM price has dropped 40% and I'd say this was due to competition, another feature of capitalism.

26 May 2015 2:23:38pmThe Australian economy was built on government control over untrammeled greed. The Harvester Judgement is a good example. It is governments that controlled the greed and destruction of corporations and ensured that the general public shared in the 'common wealth'. The spread of neo-liberal economics has resulted in the crushing of the middle class and relegated the workers to ever lower wages and conditions. This may suit the already rich and powerful who have benefited royally from this situation but society as a whole has suffered. Inequality is a sign of success for right wingers. It shows that 'their' system is working as they planned. Winner takes all. The greed is good mantra so clearly displayed by the US model we follow has seen them experience levels of poverty not seen since the 1960s. Call that progress?

When the pilotless ships etc come to fruition, what happens to the workers the automation displaces?   I realise worker obsolescence has been a factor since the late 18th century in western economies but how do you propose we manage it fairly?All I see at at the moment is a growing underclass of unemployed and a growing overclass sending their children to wealthy private schools and taking overs seas holidays.

The way technology is advancing and compounding at a faster and faster rate of change thanks to the technologies. Unemployment risks becoming a MAJOR problem in the not too distant future and will just get worse. The "experts" say the more traditional jobs will  be replaced with new modern tech jobs etc. This may be so for a number of smart and intellectual people but no where near the mass population is going to have that capacity.

Alert moderator
27 May 2015 6:50:32amThe reason we don't make anything anymore (not entirely true but getting there) is because we are too expensive. Australia as a value proposition to the world of manufacturing is too expensive and the world (including Australians) is doing what they have a right to: go elsewhere.The union movement started out with a noble goal: ensure the workers aren't taken advantage of. But beyond a certain point they're just rent-seekers and have imposed so much strain on business that the businesses just don't work anymore. Solution: offshore the labour=offshore the manufacturing=loss of Aussie jobs.A ship broker told me on the weekend that Australian able seamen get paid $180000/yr (five months of actual work) for what overseas labour does for $16000/yr (and 10 months of actual work). Now we can't expect Austrlian's to work for $16k/yr but $180k is just stupid expensive and business looks elsewhere. Little wonder that there are now only 15-odd Australian ships doing coastal shipping in Australia. And it's not just costing a few overpaid seamen their jobs: Overpricing and protectionism costs the jobs of the workers in the coal industry. It's cheaper for a factory in Adelaide to buy/ship coal from Indonesia than Newcastle - so where do they buy it from? Not Newcastle, that's for sure.Unions, taking things way too far for far too long. Killing Aussie jobs while proclaiming they're protecting them - they're only protecting the union bosses income.

26 May 2015 9:40:18amAgree Jay. Berg is way off the mark here and is simply spouting the IPA line again. This is yet another attack by them and the government on wages and conditions.Protectionism need be neither good nor bad. It needs to sensible and effective. As you say free markets capitalism is NOT all it's cracked up to be. Unregulated markets brought us the GFC, why on earth the LNP and their cheer squads like the IPA keep talking them up is beyond me.Well targeted programs like The Button plan for the automotive industry introduced by the Hawke/Keating governments, backed up by some sensible overseas marketing and support such as the old Austrade is a prime example. Traditional protectionism it was not - not a single tariff or increased tax involved. Apart from many other things like badge engineering, at it heart was just the simple idea that if overseas manufacturers wanted to import cars into Australia they had to have some local made content.Locally made switch gear, light assemblies, aluminium castings or mag wheels all made it onto imported vehicles. An 80's and early 90's model BMW or Merc will have South Australian made mags, most Nissans from that time had nearly all their aluminium engine parts made in Frankston Vic. It kept our local part manufactures volume up, which kept them competitive, and in turn kept cost down for the local car industry. Importers still brought in cars so it was win-win. It was such a great scheme nearly all countries with a car industry adopted a similar scheme and still run some variation of it. We did pay a little extra on an imported car, but your locally made Holden or Ford cost less as a result, people kept their jobs, and the government tax receipts kept ticking along.Until Howard decided it was stupid and killed it and things like Austrade for no other reason than political ideolgy. It was just another example of the economic vandilism left by Howard. What we see today in the car industry is NO WAY down to the plan being killed, but it certainly did not help. Mind you, you can go buy a much cheaper imported luxury vehicle today, unless your one of the thousands who lost their jobs in the auto industry or the supply chains. Only the European, Korean and Japanese car industries thanked Howard for that bold economic reform!We need competitive industry, but we also have to deal with reality. We are a distant supplier with very little in the way of economic volume to drive our cost down. Not all the evils in the economy are down to Unions or massive wage rates as this government would have you believe. Tyrany of distance and a small population still play the major role.In a lot of ways I'm all for reducing protectionism, but it has to be sensible and it has to replaced with something effective, and not just ideological rubbish promoted by groups like the IPA in an effort to drive down wages. I most certainly would NEVER trust a government

Unfortunately political ideology got in the way and took it too far.The entire country should lament the loss of opportunity by Howard. At a time when we could have afforded it all that money was wasted on vote buying that could have been reinvested to support our manufacturing industries to further modernize.

26 May 2015 1:29:03pm"Unregulated markets brought us the GFC"FFS go and learn what happened in the lead up tot he GFCThe US home market was put under stress by the Clinton administration when they wanted everyone to be able to own their own homes, so directed Fanny Mae and Freddie Mack to lend money to people who ad "no docs", no documentary evidence of a way to pay it back.they also directed the loans to be unguaranteed except by the property it secured.In the US you could walk away from a housing loan by simply returning the keys to the bank and moving out, no further action was required and you were not responsible for the debt.This is NOT free market economics which is abut profit, the GFC was brought about by the US government fiddling with the free market.The banks knew those loans were bad and sold them on in packages to people prepared to take the risks, till it collapsed.Then of course, the IMF and everyone else attempted to borrow their way out of debt.In Australia we had no such problem since our banks, thanks to Costello, were better regulated.the money spent by the Rudd and Gillard governments was wasted.It was meant to "trickle down", but didn't of course as profiteers pulled it out or bought up property with it.The rest of your post is just as misguided with the usual pub bar rantings about how things work, and just about all of it is wrong.Holden and Fords made locally, were rubbish and still are - if you had a choice for the same price of an Audi or BMW, (without protection), Holden and Ford would not have survived a week.

26 May 2015 5:20:16pmHard right wingers rewriting out the greed and corruption of an unregulated finance sector that caused the GFC and instead trying to blame it on some 'socialist' disaster.Usually this is a glancing reference to the CRA (Community Redevelopment Act) which banned the practice of red lining where loans were refused simply on the suburb you lived in. If you could prove by providing solid evidence that you could pay back the loan then the finance organisation could not refuse it and also got a government guarantee to back up the loan. You could not extend low-doc, no-doc or NINJA loans under this legislation. Prior to the GFC the default rates for these loans were running at about 3% which was well below default average.Clinton did not direct anyone to give out other loans. That is a complete lie. He did make the mistake of not supporting legislation that would have brought in more regulations to control lending but he didn't pass legislation to enforce lending apart from the CRA. Finance companies intentionally lent loans to all and sundry due to their very clever trick of wrapping up the loans into collateral debts that they bribed their mates at the rating agencies to rate as AAA then they sold them on. They then bet that their own CDOs would fail. Clinton had nothing to do with any of that. That was all just lack of 'red tape' and uncontrolled capitalist greed. Most of the bad loans were extended by companies that had no government connections at all but right wing history revisionists try to pretend it was just Fanny Mae and Freddie Mack.

26 May 2015 10:00:48pmCare to site your sources. Try as I might nothing comes up on google about these figures.Maybe that is because the plan involved very little government funding. It was driven by manufacturers primarily though the badge engineering Button convinced the Japanese to participate in.What didn't succeed so well was badging entire cars. The original always outsold the badged car, even though they were the exact same vehicle, and often costs less.At least the idea stuck overseas. Badge engineering is still practiced in the SUV market, and interchangeable parts between models is become the norm.

26 May 2015 12:07:15pm"The alternative being NOT free"No, Waterloo, not at all.The alternative is "regulated", but regulated sensibly.The lack of regulation caused the GFC. The race by neo-cons to further deregulate will cause another.Your evolution idea is just fine if you want a world where the strong devour the weak. Just remember if you see yourself as one of the "strong", you'll be digging the graves.Personally I'd rather see our species survival strategy a little more intelligent than that

26 May 2015 2:50:35pmGee WS without regulation of markets some one with a hell of a lot more money than you would have your shoeshine business closed so their shoe shine business could earn them more profit. Without regulations they would employ you to earn money for them shining shoes and just pay you enough to return the next day to shine shoes so they can make more profit.Without regulation any individual effort you put in will not give you the same amount of benefit it does for them. without regulation any amount of effort you put in would provide very little benefit to you.Without regulations a family like the Rockefeller could possibly own nearly everything in the world by now.I argue that advancement of our species has come about because of cooperation among us, not individual efforts. If the persons that made the wheel killed everyone else that saw it and saw the benefits it provided we wouldn't have the wheel mate.

26 May 2015 5:27:34pmHow are they going to close my shoeshine business unless the industry is regulated?  The taxi business is heavily regulated which means a few large players can shut down anybody they want because they can afford the $100K+ it costs for a license and for that kind of money they expect protection.  How about casinos?  Pharmacies?If the shoe shine company drops it's wage like you say then there will be fewer people doing that work and the price of shoeshines will go up, providing incentive for competition to start up and offer higher wages.If you got rid of the minimum wage all that would happen is youth unemployment would drop, IMHO.  Kids are in a position to trade salary for experience meaning many are over paid.  Paying them their true value would mean more employed and higher wages for skilled employees.  The only ones in danger will be the freeloaders and incompetents.

27 May 2015 2:17:31amUmm Clicky we have the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, it uses the Competition and Consumer ACT.WS can use the ACCC and this ACT to stop a competitor from charging a price which is below cost to take all WS customers.I doubt very much that the shoeshine industry is regulated It's the competition laws (regulation is basically ensuring laws and legislation are put into effect and the details of how they are put into effect) that protect WS's shoeshine business.  I suggest the reason that taxi licenses are restricted is to protect the industry. If you have the finance and can find a willing seller you can purchase Taxi licence plates.Casino require licenses and really stringent tests and investigation occurs before those licenses can be obtained because of the opportunity Casino's can provide to launder lots of illegally obtain money.Pharmacies have many regulations I say that would be because of the very dangerous drugs meant for human consumption and use, they supply ? Please explain how lowering the minimum wage would cause more jobs to be created ? If less money was available to be spent on the coffee purchased from the coffee shop having a extra worker employed there would be of little benefit don't you think ?Sure lowering the wage for the young will mean that more will probably be employed and gain experience but it would also mean once they reach the age where they are paid more they will have no job as they will be replaced with younger job seekers.gee mate paying some one $2 per every 8 hour day to cook hamburger meat and place it and other food stuffs into a bread bun wont mean more hamburgers will be sold. It wont mean that more people will buy more hamburgers. It wont mean more people will be needed to make hamburgers. All that will happen is the cost of the hamburgers will fall to the equivalent cost that wages allow hamburgers to be sold now.gee mate I want international tourist to want to come to Australia so they don't have to dodge hundreds of beggars every day. I don't expect them to buy 10 hamburgers in Australia while they are on holidays when they are hungry just because they are cheap. Gee mate people earning $2 per hour are very unlikely to come to Australia for their holidays.lower our currency exchange rate by printing more money would be a much easier way to increase our exports and international tourism then lowering our wage rates wouldn't it ?

26 May 2015 10:14:52amThe so called free market is a little like so called free trade. There is nothing "free" about either of them.For one country to completely open their industries within a protected world is sheer lunacy.The rhetoric of think tanks like the IPA is based on flawed assumptions proven wrong over the last forty years. Empirical evidence has made it clear that free markets have not delivered the benefits proposed by the neoliberal camp. The externalities alone make a good case for protecting local industry, let alone the social costs. The government is supposed to create jobs, not rip them out of the economy without any action to replace those lost jobs. Exactly the same situation with the vehicle manufacturing industry. Now they are closing, the promise of cheaper imported cars has evaporated as importers reap the benefits of the absence of local competition. This is another act of stupidity from an insular government intent in unwinding the social fabric of the country. They have no vision for Australia.

26 May 2015 11:35:20amIt is freedom to do as one pleases. not free as in 'no cost'.

26 May 2015 5:57:34pm"The government is supposed to create jobs"I think the government should have policies which aim to foster favorable economic conditions so that jobs might be created, but I do not agree it should be government's role to create the jobs themselves.  And I certainly don't agree with giving any handouts of any kind to any business.  It distorts the market, affecting the true cost of things and when the handouts stop there is always going to be pain.
Alert moderator
26 May 2015 10:15:59amAbsolutely correct, Jay. The word protectionism says it all. The alternative is predatory. Mr Berg's Institute for privatising public affairs knows no borders, and covets only other people's money. Competition of this sort will see local companies and profits gone and huge multinationals owning everything. Perhaps air travel would be cheaper if Ansettt and Compass were still viable.To accuse those on the side of protectionism as bleating and those on the side of world dominance and monopoly as promoters of reform says it all. Mr Berg is a part of a very greedy, very selfish group of reptilians dead set on destroying society and community as we know it and replacing them with an Orwellian future of proles and the minority elite.

26 May 2015 1:27:20pmDr Dig, if you espouse the values of every man for himself, you had better arm yourself and build walls around yourself. The only way for man to survive is to work together for the common good.I am fully aware of reality. i do not use the word reptilian lightly. In the world of unfettered capitalism there can only be one winner. The rest become slaves or victims. It is a very simple formula to extrapolate the survival of the fittest mentality from simple cave men to unregulated business.Choose carefully the future you wish for you will not be at the winners table.
Alert moderator
26 May 2015 2:14:43pmAnd to whom would your straw-man uber-capitalist sell goods once all around him had starved? Capitalists need prosperous surroundings to sell stuff to, and the rule of law to protect the proceeds from the envious. Henry Ford figured that out 100 years ago. Your fears that someone out there might be doing better than you have warped your view of both evolution and economics. How do you define "the common good"? The King decides? Some nice committee? Panel of experts with someone you approve of in charge? These things are not as obvious as you think. One way of doing so is asking what will people pay for, and how much. It is fallible of course, but no more so than any other, and much less than some, by virtue of the fact that anybody can have a crack at it if they want.

26 May 2015 2:35:14pmStrange how many people seem to go off on unexpected tangents in discussions here lately, which to my eye is increasing in regularity.dbtm, I never said anything about every person for themselves. There is nothing about capitalism that excludes collective behaviour, either. Your concept of reality is vastly different to mine if you can say such things as you have with conviction. Further, I gather you are accepting your lines from elsewhere without critically thinking about the assumptions underlying them as I can't fathom how else you could say such things.

26 May 2015 3:41:24pmYou haven't gone of on a tangent that it is every person for themselves dr dig ?What does survival of the fittest mean then ?If survival of the fittest occurred, the last remaining strongest person alive would have died a long long long time ago and so would have the human race too. I await the time for the IPA to sack all those that are employed by it in Australia  and replace them with Filipino's working in the Philippines for a lot less cost. Profit made comes before everything else in the IPA's views doesn't it ?
Alert moderator
26 May 2015 2:56:25pmDr Dig, in the kind of 'real word' you envisage no one will survive. The strong will devour the weak, then the strong will engage in a process of mutual self destruction. In all probability the strong will end up bashing each others' brains out with rocks, because by this stage no one will be left who has the intelligence or expertise to produce more sophisticated weapons of mutual destruction. It will be quite ironic that the last human being remaining on the planet will be just  as much a brute as the first.

Everyone (obeying the laws, which means not watching other do all the work i.e. being greedy ) would be judge to have the same value.

26 May 2015 4:19:10pmJay, my opinion is there is little right with protectionism. It can always be argued that it serves the public interest in some way.About the only people that get a benefit are those being protected. They do so at the expense of everyone else and hold back innovation, growth and competition. They are blood suckers on the economy.Free markets are a race to the top, not the bottom. Sure some struggle to make it but most don't. And if not we offer a vast array of tax provided services (from said free market) to compensate their failure.You can support the less well off, but that doesn't need to involve protectionism within markets.
Alert moderator
26 May 2015 5:24:03pm"There is little wrong with protectionism"!!!!!Whoah, whoah, whooooah doggie.Protectionism is the favouring of a select few over all other Australians. It costs every buyer, every taxpayer. It is immoral, in that it directs resources to the lazy, the incompetent and the obsolete, and robs the diligent and the competent.Protectionism is the mark of the small-minded, and the insecure. Patriots insist on the best product at the lowest price - Australian companies that can compete on those terms can compete with the world.

26 May 2015 9:17:10am"Can we afford South Australia? No, really, it's a welfare state"Ok- so lets move all the people out and privatise it. Then we can sell Tasmania. NT is an obvious candidate also. So what do we keep? And what will all the people we evacuate from the welfare states do in the other states - where will they live? Where will they work- because everything in the other states will be foreign owned if the IPA has its way and they will be all using transfer pricing to avoid tax, and sending all the work to other cheaper nations.Maybe our governments are over-restrictive but the alternative of laissez faire- each man for himself (herself) and the devil take the hindmost is not conducive to the existence of Australia as a nation state. We all have the vote- and I for one will not vote for politicians who leave me no way to exist.

Alert moderator
26 May 2015 12:12:16pmFunny you should suggest that. The SA premier, a long-term opponent of all things nuclear, as befits a member of the labor left, has set up an inquiry in SA into all things nuclear, which has just started, chaired by the most recent ex-governor. The strong rumour in SA is that he now sees it as the best, if not one of the few ways of stimulating his state's ailing economy - otherwsie why would he open such a can of worms with an inquiry. Quite possibly the state will host a nuclear waste dump and maybe, in the longer term, as nuclear power station. There seems to be quite a bit of support in SA for a move in this direction, though of course also quite a lot of opposition.

26 May 2015 9:34:17amSorry Mick can't agree. Australia cannot hope to be competitive with manufacturing priced at a third world standard of living that is why most international product manufacturing is done in third world countries. If Australians wants to retain this living standard and commiserate wage structure they will need to protect any future attempts to manufacture from cheap imports that have destroyed todays Australian manufacturing. It's the price you pay for our wonderful quality of life.
Alert moderator
26 May 2015 12:17:39pmI guess in its own way the free market is the ultimate tool for socialist equality because it favours the most impoverished economies and therefore helps them obtain the same standard of living as the developed world.Except it achieves that by actually reducing the developed world's standard of living to that of the impoverished world, save for the select few with enough wealth to capitalise on the capitalist system and create uncountable wealth for themselves at the expense of the entire rest of the world.
Alert moderator
26 May 2015 1:16:50pmWell you are half way there with your logic.If goods and services are produced cheaper, then the money you earn goes further.If you earn $100 rather than $110 because of competition and efficiency that sounds bad at first I agree but...What happens if the goods and services you were going to buy also fall, let's say from $100 to $80. Don't forget you have removed inefficiencies and protectionism.It's interesting - you start with less but you actaully have more money left over.
Alert moderator
26 May 2015 2:13:15pmThe problem comes in when you look at that $100 instead of $110 that you've earned because of market competition.It still has to pay for first-world roads, infrastructure, education, health, police, courts, government services and, yes, social welfare.  All of this contributes to our first-world lifestyle and all of it requires taxes.If a country that doesn't provide all these things is able to produce the same thing for $70 that costs me $100 when you factor in all those social services, then the combination of globalisation and free-market thinking will do me out of a job.In fact, it'll eventually force everyone who lives in a first-world society out of a job.And if I don't have a means to earn the $100 in the first place, the reduced cost of goods and services doesn't help me one bit.So if you want government-provided services, you have to be willing to pay tax.  And if our local companies are more highly taxed and therefore cost more, the government has to protect them so they can stay in business rather than be overrun by foreign companies.Unfortunately, our government doesn't protect those businesses.  So they're not able to compete.  So Australians are losing jobs.  So there's less tax available to the government.  So they have to cut services such as health, education, welfare and infrastructure.  So eventually we'll end up like those countries that don't have first-world societies and then we'll be able to compete economically again.  So basically we can have a pure free market or a developed first-world society, but we can't have both.  And we seem to keep voting to have the former not the latter.
Alert moderator
26 May 2015 12:43:30pmYou've exposed the inherent contradiction: We want Australian lifestyles with cheap goods.The reality the major boost in living standards over the last two decades has come from primarily from cheap imported goods, not improvements in efficiency. Sure we could create protectionist barriers but that would just mean we couldn't afford to purchase those goods.
Alert moderator
26 May 2015 2:56:38pmWe also cant manufacture those goods.
Alert moderator
26 May 2015 3:24:23pmI don't want cheap goods. I want goods that are well made and which are produced by people who are paid a decent wage and who enjoy decent working conditions. I want goods that are made in factories which meet first world environmental protection standards. I want goods that are made in factories which use electricity that doesn't come courtesy of the hundreds of Chinese coal miners who die in mining accidents every year. Last week I purchased a wool blanket made in Australia. It was almost twice the price of a wool blanket made in China. This is the length I'm prepared to go to in order to support what might be termed vaguely civilised capitalism. If this means that I have less cash to spend on other stuff then so be it.

26 May 2015 10:03:00am"We need to strip away all the protectionism in this country, it costs us too dearly and is just another form of welfare."This struck me as an odd thing to say mick.When you talk about the collective "us" did you calculate in the increased unemployment costs, including all the social ills that come about from high levels of unemployment? Did you calculate the reduced tax receipts? Did you calculate the cummulative effect this ideology of driving down wages will have on YOUR pay packet eventually? Did you calculate the cost of having to rely on overseas suppliers for things as trivial as soft drinks?Most local industries are struggling to compete with overseas, which makes your "super profit" line clearly ridiculas. So too your idea our car industry produced "rubbish". Both the Commodore and Falcon were a huge success for years in the Middle East because they handled the environment better than US, Japanese and European cars. In fact Holden only kept going for this long because it could import Monaros and V8 Commodores as long as they did.So whats your solution? Cutting SA and Tassie out of the federation?

26 May 2015 12:19:42pmYes 5min I do. I lived through the worst of tarriff reductions in the late 70's and early 80's.These were necessary reforms redressing historical errors by successive governments since Menzies. I started work as a toolmaker apprentice in 1978 in a large engineering factory in Millperra still using a lot of WW2 era machinery, such was the disincentive to modernise promoted by tarriff protection. Frazer started addressing this issue, but it was those hated lefties in Hawke and Keating that made us take the medicine. It's funny seeing a right wing comment accusing the left of wanting to go back to the 1950's given both recent LNP governments this country has had.Tarriff reduction was done sensibly in the early 80's. We needed to be weened off it and industry needed help to cope with the change. Industry needed help gaining access to overseas markets. They needed tax incentives to modernize their equipment. They certainly weren't cut adrift by a government that is willing to see entire sectors fail as long as they rid the world of any Union members.That's a far cry from what Berg is calling for. Cut and run, dog eat dog economics is not the answer here.

Alert moderator
26 May 2015 10:41:57am@ Star Hash FourAgree totally.  Anything the IPA supports cannot be good for Australian citizens simply because IPA is about profit making schemes.I had no objections to any company to make a profit and have always thought the old 1/3 rule the fairest pricing model...that is... one third to pay for the resources needed to make a product or supply a service, one third to pay for wages needed to pay to those who make the product or supply the service [employees] and one third to make a profit.  Without a profit businesses cannot survive for the usual reasons.It is the obscene profits being made by companies that is problematic. It is the obscene salaries being paid to CEOs that is problematic.In these two instances we know that either or both the employees and/or the environment have been ripped off.  It is also these companies, it is said, that are not paying their fair share of tax which sees this LNP government go after the most vulnerable in our society because they can strip a little more off these folk who don't have the resources to defend themselves: this is totally opposite to these big businesses who can afford to fund lawyers and litigation to defend themselves and their questionable ethics.
Alert moderator
26 May 2015 12:37:56pmYou don't understand profits very well do you NTOW. There are not many businesses or companies making obscene profits, if there is such a thing. When a major company posts a profit of say a hypothetical figure of $20B, it is absurd to shout that this is an obsecne profit. If it took $200B of investment to achieve that profit it is much smaller than the one you think is fair (33% apparently). Indeed, the figure you think is fair would be a mere pipe dream for most as  I can assure you that not many businesses or companies operate on such a margin.I guess you also think the accelerated depreciation for small business announced in the budget amounts to a hand out as well.

No national shipping or airlines under our control leaving us vulnerable to external abandonment pressures from foreigners not loyal to Australia. Nothing is safe in this world so don't kid yourselves as two world wars have proven in our past.

26 May 2015 10:26:48amSo why the protectionism for our fossil fuel industries?  They are rapidly becoming non viable on the world stage as solar and other renewable energy generation increase.  It seems, however, that it is OK for Australians to pour heaps of our money into supporting (protecting) these industries (at least some of which go to great lengths to avoid paying their taxes here) with consequences that are deleterious both to the planet's climate, our natural environnment and our future prosperity.  Rather than opening our skies and seas, how about opening our eyes and our minds?  While we are about it, we might like to consider our hearts and borders as well.  Chris, maybe you might like to consider an article on ecological relationships at some stage.  An opening of the mind to the idea that there are more processes in this world than financial ones.  Views which fail to take reality into account are likely to have disasterous consequences as all those ignored ecological (including social ie human ecology) processes play out.

26 May 2015 10:31:58amAbsolute garbage! The only thing really too expensive here is housing prices, and that's due to a LACK of protectionism.
Alert moderator
26 May 2015 11:16:27amNo , it's because residential real estate is protected as the sacred cow of the Australian economy. It is taxed less (no CGT) and supported more (first home buyer schemes and neg gearing)  than any other investment form. Houses have thus become an investment strategy first and a way of keep in the rain off last, and become affordable only to those whose pile is already made.It is a different sort of protectionism to the tariffs and excise that Berg is referring to here, but it is protectionism nonetheless. Without the featherbedding, without the spiral upwards it creates, the foreign money pressure you are referring to would evaporate leaving only a few disappointed real state agents.

26 May 2015 10:49:56amSouth Australia has the odd financial problem, like all the other States. Their budget has been slashed by the Federal Government,  the car industry has been let die by the Commonwealth Government and the fledgling ship building industry is to be smashed, also by the Federal Government. In relation to the ship building, if you take away the costs of the initial infrastructure to build the ships, the cost the the build has been, no doubt, reasonable.  The South Australian Government and the workers in those industries have not stuffed anything up. What has stuffed things up is the lack of vision by our current Government in supporting a range of industries e.g. solar technologies and other 21st Century innovation. Thanks for your hand out, from wherever you are. South Australia remains a fabulous innovative place to live, work and play.

26 May 2015 11:49:31amThis is all fine, but how comfortable are we with importing third world industrial conditions into what is in effect domestic transport within Australia. How can, say, an Australian trucking Company compete on carrying freight between Sydney and Perth while paying Australian terms and conditions, including OHS, leave etc to drivers while ships crew are paid the average wage of a part trained Bangladeshi?Let's have competition in the economy by all means but only when the playing field is level

26 May 2015 1:43:19pmGreat in theory but only if every country plays by the same rules and they don't. So if we go ahead with this we'll be sending jobs and profits overseas yet again and may as well hang up the 'Closed' shingle.You cannot compare the price of a product here unless you also compare income, tax and everything else. Wages are cheaper in many countries but those workers often do not have work cover, annual leave or reason work conditions. Do you want to import that philosophy as well?As for denigrating SA and Tas maybe you should educate yourself before you do this. SA has a brilliant record in many industries including medical research, computer graphics for the movie industry, wine, fish farming and there was actually nothing wrong with the cars manufactured here. The car industry suffered from the cost of production issues stemming from wages which cannot compete with the low wages of many other car producers.

27 May 2015 4:16:52amI'm all for competitive conduct & my business has to be competitive because we export a lot of what we do, but it is a knowledge based value adding exercise so we have a competitive advantage (for now).But not all industries are equal in this regard & transport has the ability to bring in low wage labour, in which case Qantas & Virgin will have to be allowed to do the same.Then you may as well allow jobs in every company in every sector to be filled by low wage overseas workers.Maybe this is the ultimate end point regardless - totally free labor market - but how will you manage the explosive decompression of Australian wages without the chaos of equivalent plummet in asset prices to match purchasing power?The only way to unscramble our high cost structure without US style economic disaster is for the $ to drop so our costs are naturally lower. But while mining & higher interest rates prevent this then you'll just be exposing transport industry to unique competition it can't match, so that will be the end of those Australian companies.I like your optimism, but unfortunately nothing is as simple as you make out.Find a way to seamlessly fix the problem of $1M land prices & other input costs & then we'll be making progress...
Alert moderator
26 May 2015 8:33:08amSorry Chris can't agree. Australians have watched their manufacturing disappear to cheaper imports from countries with a much lower standard of living so how can it be good to see our air industry and coastal shipping do the same.I personally believe Australian governments have got it wrong in abolishing tariffs and protected industry. Australians have a standard of living to maintain and should be prepared to pay for it. Australians don't appear to understand you can't have a country living on government hand-outs when the countries debt is outstripping income.
Alert moderator
26 May 2015 9:30:27amgbeI'm happy to say that for once we are in agreement.Although this is not quite like the removal of import tariffs, it's effect will be to devastate the lives of workers in that sector, with more demanding workloads reduced employment and lower wages (efficiencies they call them).I was not surprised to hear that the deaths of 500 people  in India due to a heatwave comprised of elderly, homeless, and construction workers.This is what you can expect of a system that allows the existence of companies that value continued production before the lives of it's workers. Are these the kind of companies we want running our shipping and transport. (though it seems these kind of companies are already running our road transport industry).We should be reintroducing tariffs and increasing regulation on business behaviour, not continuing further down this "lowest common denominator" deregulation road that just gets rockier the further we go as it takes us from the high street to the slums.

26 May 2015 1:11:44pmNo, this is where your pure capitalist fantasy falls down. By not investing our occasional wins and instead buying cheap foreign goods, Australia doesn't have enough value-added goods or expertise to sell to buy the goods and services you expect. Our aviation, car and shipbuilding industries used to have expertise in certain areas that they sold to America and Europe. Our universities and research institutes are small but have had some big wins in computing, biotech and alternative energy. Our response has been to kill off manufacturing and slash education and R&D and instead give foreign mining companies huge tax breaks and protect sunset industries like coal-fired power. All that's left for kids to do is serve coffee to the few people left in jobs.

26 May 2015 10:12:47amI mostly agree.The only exception is when an Australian entity becomes privatized, gains a monopoly as a result and abuses their position by cutting and exporting jobs and ripping off Australian customers. Qantas lost all right to demand our loyalty and low-grade airlines like Jetstar and Tiger will never deserve it either. They are largely the reason I no longer desire to take holidays in Australia anymore, and I actually welcome these loathsome companies getting pushed aside by some competition.

26 May 2015 10:32:29am"The only exception is when an Australian entity becomes privatized, gains a monopoly as a result and abuses their position by cutting and exporting jobs and ripping off Australian customers."Add Telstra to that mix. By privatising the access network, too, Telstra has held back Australian telecoms for years. Legally, that is exactly what Telstra should have been doing, but it was just as clear that their predatory practises were not in the national interest.

26 May 2015 10:35:37amYou have touched on the crux of the matter. You see our standard of living is commiserate to the wages people are paid for their labour consequently goods produced here cost more to buy than a place where labour is cheap.You can't have a wonderful standard of living and pay workers peanuts and you wont have any industry if you import cheap goods.

26 May 2015 10:23:51amI love how cheap the latest TV and computers are. And that's due to the lack of tariffs and protection for any locally made products. Sure the worker people overseas may not be not earning our minimum wage. But I expect their cost of living is not as high as it is here.Plus not only are overseas workers doing things cheaper, but like our boats are showing, they are doing it better. if we want to complete, then we need to look at countries like Germany. An industry giant in the EU, it doesn't have low wages, but still manages to produce top quality items that people all over the world buys.China went low wages, but still manages to be a world leader, and has led to a much greater standard of living for their workers, and a new generation of the very rich.

26 May 2015 11:27:43am@ Politically IncorrectTotally agree.  For the life of me I cannot imagine why anyone [not a business] would support a political party that is ideologically opposed to the benefits of the citizens of this country.  That is...the current version of the LNP...a neo liberal party to the core.A friend of mine in Sydney recounted a tale, which at the heart of it, had many of his associates voting for the LNP simply because it was the 'socially acceptable party' in their circle [whom are all pensioners happily taking the benefits bought to them by the Labor party].  So to be accepted they vote the LNP and yet the current version of the LNP is colluding with big business to rip off any basic rights and protections for the people and for the environment.  Defies belief.  The LNP DOUBLED the debt ceiling on taking government and yet they still blather on about the debt the Labor party supposedly left and, this, after the Labor party steered the country through the global financial crisis.  It defies belief that whilst other countries seem to be emerging from the GFC [a greed based phenomenon] Australia, under the leadership of the neo liberal LNP government is heading for a recession.  Talk about good money managers....what a laugh!I simply don't believe the rhetoric that the LNP are better money managers.  If anything the last 2 budgets have to be seen as examples of the LNPs idea of making money grow.Instead of creating conditions in Australia where new and emerging businesses can prosper for each of our benefits [revenue generation] they simple see each and everyone of us as a 'revenue source'.  At this rate the old rule about where tax arises [personal tax, company tax and goods and services tax] will see company tax reduced leaving the result of us to pay more.The day we were began to be referred to as 'human resources' rather than 'employees' was the beginning of a slippery slope.  Resources implies the ability to move resources for the benefits of the business.  Employees are human beings and not resources.

26 May 2015 9:58:32amWhat we need is more regulation to encourage competition, say like a market domination tax coefficient on businesses that own too greater share of any market, we could start for instance with a 50% increase of the current tax formula when a business reaches a certain level of market domination.We could set the rate for different sectors at different levels, starting with the iron ore mining sector perhaps at a level of 20%. Telecommunications at 33%.When we want to increase more completion and innovation into any sector we just reduce the level for that sector.It's all about balance, and we want small local businesses to get bigger, and not at the cost of a lesser number of small local businesses. To do that we need to make big businesses to get smaller to make some room.

26 May 2015 8:55:44amlegislation doesnt change the heart, but it restrains the heartless. By deregulating, I can promise some greedy person is going to take advantage and run some business only concerned in profits and make things worse for the working man/woman. As we have seen in every industry from milk to airlines to power - competition makes things cheap and then those who cant afford to run with such small margins or volume only, go broke and then the big players remain and jack up prices. In a globalized world, deregulation can be very bad. Once the genie is out of the bottle, we cant go back. This govt. will deregulate/sell/create competition in any area it can for a buck. Most of the pollies seem to have conflicts of interest and shipping will be no different. Do the people of this country own anything anymore - and if we have sold everything from our roads to our water and power then why do we pay more tax?  Surely, we should be paying less since we have less industries of our own - but no. The private sector not only want our assets, they want tax dollars to help them run their new business

That is what tariffs do. I have clients who cannot compete on price with supplying manufactured components to the Pilbara from Sydney, not because their product is not better ( it is)  or the ex-factory price is dearer ( it is the same),  but because shipping from Thailand is one third of the price.

Alert moderator
26 May 2015 12:12:18pmThis is true.  While protectionism assists some (in this case, shippers and airlines), it hurts others (manufactureres relying on those shipped goods for instance, as you mention).One of the reasons Australian steelmakers struggle (another being exchange rates were too high for too long) is freight.  They can only use Australian flagged vessels to ship iron ore from the Pilbara and coal from Illawarra or Queensland to their plants.  That shipping is 3-5 times the cost of shipping those items to China/Japan/Korea on non-Australian flagged vessels.So the jobs argument goes both ways.

26 May 2015 9:09:11amIn April 2010 the Chinese owned Shen Neng 1 ran up on a reef in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Clean-up has been going on ever since and funds have now run out : not clear if the Chinese owners had inadequate insurance or no insurance at all. Everything about that grounding was disturbing ranging from the fact that the ship's master didn't know where he was largely due to the lack of experienced and trained crew and, of course, they were not carrying a Reef Pilot. This happened obviously before we decided to deregulate coastal shipping and I just hope that this government in their enthusiasm for deregulation will maintain some oversight of overseas vessels entering our waters. We need to look very closely at 'flags of convenience' for instance; the registration of vessels in small obscure countries is done principally to avoid  the costs of complying with the regulatory requirements of more responsible and developed countries. We need to enforce adequate insurance and indemnity issued by recognised insurance companies as well as looking closely at the crewing arrangements which obviously includes their training and competence. Deregulation is an LNP rallying call to the faithful but I ask that we just remember that regulations were originally introduced for a reason.

Similar thing happened in the UK energy market when government-owned utilities were sold and bought by  government-owned utility providers based in Europe. With the consequence that UK consumers are now paying dividends to French and German taxpayers.

26 May 2015 9:17:58amCan only speak from personal experience and that of my family.  i live in a central coastal part of Queensland.  A relative who lives in a far north Queensland mining town finds it is less expensive to fly from Cairns(they get their flight from their town to Cairns paid by their principal employer twice a year) to Brisbane and then back to where I live, a distance of over two thousand kilometres, rather than from Cairns direct to where I live, a distance of about nine hundred kilometres.Personally, unless I book my flight from my city to Brisbane, to visit family or for medical attention, well in advance, I will have to pay in the vicinity of four hundred dollars return for a trip of about six hundred kilometres.Of course volume is the name of the game and we are fortunate we have at least two airlines competing for customers, otherwise who knows what the cost would be.  I know we have a very large country with a small population.Allowing foreign airlines and shipping to compete may reduce prices for residents but it surely would reduce Australian work forces.  There is of course the safety aspect as well as we in Australia have a very good safety record mainly due to our regulations.  Will these still apply or will they be watered down under pressure from vested interests.  I also think about our border protection from a bio security and smuggling point of view as well as how the employment of low paid and badly accommodated and treated maritime workers sits with our ethos of fair treatment of workers.

26 May 2015 9:19:21amCompetition is a good, as long as you have a level playing field. There's no such thing with airlines. You've got state-sponsored outfits that can essentially run at a loss forever - why should we give them a leg up in the domestic market.As much as Qantas-bashing appears to be fashionable, they have to compete against foreign airlines with a much lower cost base (the main portion being wages). Given margins in the industry are notoriously thin, why drive an Australian company into the ground?

26 May 2015 9:21:30am"No labour costs means pilotless ships can travel slower, thereby using less fuel. This is good for cheap shipping and the environment."Nice line Chris but given the size of modern vessels and  the value of the goods on board the labour costs are really insignificant...even more so after the goods leave Singapore.All sounds great until someone's boat gets hacked.We still haven't found flight MH370 and that had a crew.

26 May 2015 9:22:59amIt's difficult to let foreign operators in, while forcing the local companies to stick to a lot of regulation. It's reverse of protectionism. For example, domestic aircraft and crews are subject to all sorts of expensive CASA requirements. Foreign operators will not be subject this, at least not in a practical sense.The Federal govt. does not bother enforcing the terms of 417 visas, and they won't be bothered enforcing anything else.Agriculture will always be protected. If Barnaby doesn't like something, it won't happen. The ADM takeover, for instance. The stumpy tail that wags the extremely stupid dog.

26 May 2015 9:24:11amOpening up our ports to "free markets" would be fine if there were actually free markets, which there are not, and if all people on the planet had an equally high standard of living. Since there is such massive disparity, every time we remove "protections", which are really protecting Australia's jobs and standard of living, we are just moving our entire way of life closer to a third world level. I'm pretty sure people like Chris Berg understand this and for some reason are keen to see Australia become a third world nation.

26 May 2015 9:29:23amIf its good for consumers then we should move on this. Is it? I think the answer is an unqualified yes. The comments about reciprocity are red herrings and not relevant. Are we really not going to carry out beneficial reforms because other countries won't do the same?? Doesn't seem like a really smart approach to me??The comments about Australian manufacturing are also off the mark, people need to wake up and think through why we manufacture things in Aust, because unless a real strategic benefit exists, then no we shouldn't. Thank god we won't be making cars anymore when you look at the billions we shovelled to multinationals to produce very average cars. Look at the shambles with the new navy boats.Less protection is unambiguously good for consumers and the Nation.

All Australian workers and farmers who lose their jobs (to the $5 day worker in Asian sweatshops), will still be guaranteed a job?4.

26 May 2015 5:16:41pmAirline tickets are a small fraction of what they were under old nose-to-tail duopoly vastly expanding the range of people who can fly for work or holidays; and our non-existent coastal shipping and prohibitively overpriced maritime services are a liability created precisely by the policies you are defending.  There are no "Australian lines" any more, and shippers would chew their own legs off to avoid employing an Australian crew.You could not have picked two better examples to lose your argument.

26 May 2015 9:58:18am Love the selectivity of the IPA, lead the world in removal of domestic airline and shipping "protection", BUT wait for everyone else in the world to do something about climate change first!  By the way, as I understand it the only cargo carried on the Australian Coast in Australian ships are inter company cargoes, ie, ore to refineries and the like. So the removal of cabotage will make NO difference to domestic goods prices, everything is transported by road with a small amount by rail. I also recall when the last Australian ship carrying International cargo was removed, the International shipping Cos. DOUBLED the freight rates. The Farmers Federation and other exporters screamed blue murder. Pete Costello huffed and puffed but there was nothing either could do about it. Do you remember Mr. Berg? Also do you remember when the British Govt. needed ships for the Falklands war? Not enough British Flagged ships were available and to charter in other Flag ships cost a very heavy premium. We are not the centre of anything, we are at the end of a long thin supply line. The Shipping Cos. know this and can charge accordingly. They know we are dependent on them not the otherway around therefore in the true spirit of "Capitalism"  the principle of we've gottit you wantit- you pay our prices.  The main purpose of this exercise is to get rid of the Maritime Union (Seamans Union), with arguably some justification, but the main purpose is political, to settle old scores.Good luck IPA and LNP.

26 May 2015 10:01:07amChris, you are wrong because you fail to consider Australia in a global context.  You still don't seem to understand that how the market operates in a textbook versus how it operates in practice are different things.  This is because your textbook requires 'perfect' market conditions which you just don't get in real life.Loosening protectionism is good in most occasions to allow expansion and growth.  But getting rid of it completely is not always beneficial.  Being able to remove it entirely relies on whether the playing field is level - in this case it most certainly is not.When Qantas and Virgin are permitted to compete on internal domestic routes in Europe, China and the USA, then getting rid of it is a good idea.  But all you will be doing by reducing the protection of the airline industry now will be sending jobs overseas.  I understand that the theory says lower prices should  result from more competition, but 'more competition' isn't the same thing as 'good competition'.

26 May 2015 10:14:07amA question to the Esteemed Chris Berg.   If foreign owned shipping is so good for a country, why does the U S defend its Jones Act so vigoursley?   This act only allows U S built and owned ships manned by U S crews, to engage in cabotage, thus protecting another industry, and creating employment. Our system of giving out single voyage permits to any ship allows any rust bucket with crews not checked properly by border protection, to operate on the Australian Coast .  The reason Australian Shipping declined was howards fear of the dreaded unionists, he removed as many Australian  ships as he could  from the seas,  Thus transfering revenue to foreign ship owners.   Including Singapore in the list of countries that allow foreign airlines operate internally completes the joke, Flying from Changi to Changi by Qantas would undoubtably be a winner.  Someone posted that the higher cost of soft drink in Australia is attributted to high wages, well, what causes the astronomical prices in supermarkets as the recent revelation of virtual slave labour in their suppliers have shown? Surely not high wages?

26 May 2015 10:14:45amWhen I saw the author on the opinion piece, Chris Berg of the supposedly benign sounding 'Institute of Public Affairs', I knew that anything Chris supported would ultimately be about removing any protection of the Australian people and or the environment in the mad pursuit for the almighty dollar.Wonder how long the benign sounding Institute of Public Affairs has been agitating with the LNP government and wonder how many dollars will flow into the war chest for the upcoming election so that this government, hand in glove with the IPA can continue to ensure each and everyone of us is a commodity to be manipulated to ensure profit goes into the hands of some company..... that is the profit generated off each and everyone of us.  Next they will be lobbying the LNP government for a reduction in airline safety standards because it costs money and that's not good for business ...apparently.  There will potentially be minimal safety air line standards where service is outsourced to the poorest nations none of which bodes well for us.It would behove each of us to understand the driving force of the IPA which you can see at http://ipa.org.au/publications/2080/be-like-gough-75-radical-ideas-to-transform-australiaIf the political donations policy is not improved we will never know the full extent to which the IPA and its supporting companies funds the electioneering for the LNP.  It is interesting that there must be an ability to manipulate the voters via advertising otherwise companies like the IPA would not be pouring dollars int the war chests of this neo liberal LNP government.At its heart [not a good word when used to explain the IPA] the IPA will drive to remove any and every form of legislation that seeks to protect the most vulnerable and our environment.  We might think we aren't in the 'most vulnerable' category but, as an example of hat I like to call 'poverty creep' we now have a new category called 'the working poor'.  This has occurred because organisations like the IPA have agitated for the removal of working conditions that give employees a basic, reasonable and respectful salary.  If organisations like the IPA continue to covertly influence the political process, as they do in the USA and increasingly in Australia, there will be no safety net for any of us and other than the super rich we will all joining the 'working poor' category....mere chess pieces to be moved around for the benefit of businesses...just like the 17th and 18th centuries.

26 May 2015 10:40:01amAn interesting and informative article Chris Berg. This struck me:"Over the last few decades, the number of Australian registered ships used in coastal shipping has been in a dramatic decline. In 1996 there were 75 Australian registered ships in the coastal trade. Truss told a conference last week that number was now just 15."Just wondering what the environmental impact is here. If only Australian registered ships can do this, and there are so few of these, then the goods have to be transported by rail or road. How much fossil fuel per kg of freight, (and consequent CO2 emissions), does it take with these alternative modes of transport? Rail I know is relatively fuel efficient, but that is limited too. So we are left with road freight and I think we know how efficient that is.

26 May 2015 10:53:23amIt'll do away with Australian jobs at a time when we can least afford them.The ever present problem concealed by the mining boom is one that goes to the very Achilles heel of a capitalist system. That accruing greatest profit often simply implies distributing least wealth. It hasn't created enough jobs.We've abandoned manufacturing to our very great peril in this country and with it any sense of real focus upon individual agency or national involvement in wealth creation projects. If you exploit resources and that's all you do then depending on how ownership of those resources is treated you may need to socialise the economy more if you mean to have it support the population adequately. It would be democratically untenable to support the population inadequately beyond the point where you'd be properly entitled to ask how much agency the individual has in providing for himself. If he then chooses to vote for a political party that promotes his interests in supporting industries that will create more Australian jobs then how could you say he has the wrong idea....No amount of free market ideology overcomes this kind of self-interest. All it really does is to favour the cunning and the exploitative over the ignorant being fed falsehoods about where their interests might lie.

26 May 2015 2:20:20pmPerhaps the best we can hope for in the kind of democracy that we have is to share government between major parties in turns. It is also said that a week is a long time in politics, making it an absolute aeon since Menzies uttered his "sheep's back" remark. Manufacturing and other tertiary industries along with agriculture itself have risen and fallen since then. If anything Whitlam didn't help though I think Hawke and Keating did, and again more recently Swan's stimulus steadied the ship, but Gillard ultimately gave up the auto industry without so much as a whimper.I don't necessarily expect the conservatives' ideology to help industries that create jobs or support a living wage. Their social contract isn't with the worker. But I listened to Shorten's budget reply speech with sceptical interest because at least he seems to be saying some of the things we need to hear. As far as comments go if I'm just venturing a less analytical opinion I suspect emerging technology, perhaps associated with new energy alternatives, may be the last great opportunity this country cannot afford to miss if we want to secure the kind of lifestyle into the future we've relied too heavily upon good fortune to deliver in the past.

They want all the benefits of living in a modern liberal- democratic society with the rule of law and yet want the services of poorer nations whos ships are unsafe by our standards crewed by sailors who are badly trained and underpaid.This the same parasitic attitude that sees wealthy nations importing doctors from poor nations that have spent their some of their own meagre revenue to train them only to lose them to a country that could easily afford to train its own but selfishly refuses to do so.

26 May 2015 11:28:36amLifting protectionism is meaningless for Australians who live and need to travel outside of the profitable airline routes.Like a foreign airline is going to provide services on any of the unprofitable routes? What's in it for them Chris Berg other than to receive taxpayers money as an incentive to provide basic air services to small populated State and regional communities in Australia?Seems to me these policies and many like them have simply allowed foreign owned business to take numerous bites of Australians hip pocket. You know Chris the Australians that pay taxes to the government who zealously spouts a need to reduce spending by reducing services for Australians. Oh I forgot, subsidising industry like foreign airlines that with Australias tax laws could conceivably pay no tax in Australia is an investment. Supporting  industry actually based in Australia and employs Australians that heaven above have union representation whose members pay tax as taxpayers is a drain, curse, plague, anti-competitive and indulgence.Have you looked at the ongoing trillions of US dollars spent on US agricultural subsidies, protection of the US ship building and aircraft building industries, tax free status of US petroleum companies and so on and so on, Chris?Australia has a small population compared to the size of the landmass. Profits to be earned (without government legislated top ups of earnings coming directly from the taxpayer): how are any of the airlines that - even with cost cutting to the bone, non unionised but still  expensive business model which needs massive market share - going to make money in Australia (which we already know will be offshored and not taxed here anyway)? Answer I guess is big fare hikes> But won't that reduce demand for seats and impact on airline profitability?And Chris, since the majority of the world's airlines are subsidised by foreign governments at home base  which you seem to have no problem with; where is the business case you rely on to expose Qantas and Virgin to competition from this subsidised, non level playing field airline industry competition?Ask yourself Chris, at what point in the aircraft technological phenomena will you unreservedly get on a pilotless aircraft or ship; More importantly happily put your tax taxpayer subsidised children on? Until the technology proves itself will authorities and airlines be forced to pay for fully accredited pilots just in case something goes wrong, like they forgot to instal the failsafe software called "crashguard" plus a really, really big parachute for the aircraft?I'm really tired as a taxpayer and consumer with think tanks proposing policy in Australia in the void of never answering and providing one iota of detail to even suggest it is worthwhile policy reform.I think I'm part of a growing group of Australian taxpayers and consumers who should start our own tax exempt think ta

Chris and Mick have ignored so many facts, experience and history for the narrow focus on ideology that has little evidence of success, if any. So many ideologies that support profiteering that ultimately destroys competition have failed again and again. The fantasy of the Free Market, the Trickle Down effect and many others, usually the domain of right wing conservative governments world wide, have all been debunked by fact, experience and history. Australia does not experience high prices because of protectionism. It is generally caused in many cases by profiteering by global and overseas corporations like Apple, record companies and most others as proven by recent government investigations. I will acknowledge that shipping costs here are high from personal experience. Part of this is due to low population - I don't recommend greater population size though.

26 May 2015 1:13:09pm"The fantasy of the Free Market, the Trickle Down effect and many others, usually the domain of right wing conservative governments world wide, have all been debunked by fact, experience and history."So little knowledge about economics BarryThe very underlying principle by governments all over the world for spending up big to get out of the effects of the GFC was, the trickle down effect.So, every country, including Australia was in a fantasy then?I don't believe in Keynesian economics mate, that creating demand produces supply.It's not a Right Wing ideology actually, Keynesian economics is usually associated with the left of politics, the tax and spend bunch.You've mixed up a bunch of different effects, all trying to blame on Right Wing ideologies.This one though is a pearler, so wrong "Australia does not experience high prices because of protectionism"So you reckon cars are cheaper here? Electronics? Clothing?You name it and if it is not protected, then it is a reasonable price, and if it is available on the internet, then local competitors are failing due to being unable to compete, not because of margins but because their lifestyles and the rent and all the other factors have floated up to the levels they could charge Australians, right up until the internet competes .. those businesses are failing.The retailers and businesses who used to make super profits from us due to protectionism, are failing and that's a good thing. Their workers can find other jobs, everyone can, it may not be as good and it may be better than their last job, but that's their choice, if they improve themselves they are more attractive to employersYOU're not "entitled" to a job you know.

26 May 2015 2:45:25pm'For decades Australia has been an enthusiastic adopter to free market approach. The consequences-such as mas privatisation- tariff reforms. and flexible wages and conditions -have been lauded by the booming financial sector and political class. Unnoticed in the hubbub, though has been the annihilation of the manufacturing sector -which has resulted in 20 years of monthly current account deficits and a foreign debt approaching $650 billion-and an economy dominated by footloose capital and tax averse- multi nationals"Martin Feil. The fantasy started with neo liberal economics back in the 1970s- it led to the GFC and debt driven economies. How much is Australia's and the world debt now?- including private and household debt. Its people spending  up big on stuff they did not need with money they did not have- your brand of economics - which has destroyed free enterprise.

26 May 2015 1:16:17pmThe never asked question Chris is just how far do we take protectionism and just as importantly what is going to be the ultimate result.To answer the first question, why should there be any limits whatsoever and it is not as though we do not already have many organisations basing call centres abroad - why?, and that's simple in that wage rates are going to be far far lower and it is not just call centres either for even Xrays can be transmitted to radiologists in India or wherever to report on, that being somewhat different to the patients having their Thai or Phillipines medical/dental holiday so where should we stop?What not allow people from abroad who are prepared to do so at cheap rates becoming our bureaucrats and politicians?Feeling comfortable Chris?So where will all this it's cheaper abroad take us to?We are seeing so much of it already, demise of the car industry, food imports and that even started in decades past for I remember being at a local civic meeting when a youngish Joe Hockey stated that it was all OK for Riverina citrus growers to bulldoze orchards if it was cheaper to import citrus concentrate from Brazil.Yeah, right on and where we are headed is forever less employment and what employment there will be will be backpacker's rates.

26 May 2015 3:10:32pmNo, the writer of the article, has it all wrong.A mutiny is a rebellion of the people, against the ruling class.In this instance, we the people, as usual, have no say.This is simply yet another instance of the ruling class telling the people "this is the way that it will be, and, you will like it, whether you like it or not".It is definitely not a mutiny.But, unfortunately, literacy and journalists, seem mutually exclusive.In checking, the Concise Oxford Dictionary gives the meaning of the word "mutiny", as "an open revolt against constitutional authority" - in other words, the people of australia, rebelling against the federal government.It would never happen.Australia is too apathetic.

26 May 2015 4:12:00pmAustralia does not have a free market!  The United States does not have a free market!  No country on this planet has a free market.  If any country did have a free market there would be no bankruptcy protection, no impediment to anyone entering or leaving any market.  There would be no government welfare for big companies, those "...too large to be allowed to fail."No aviation market on planet Earth allows foreign airlines on domestic routes, especially NOT the USA!  If Australia allows it we can kiss goodbye to thousands of Australian jobs and expect to pay more for less on foreign airlines.  Anyone who has travelled on a US airline recently would know that they are the dregs at the bottom of the market, expensive and lacking in service.  European airlines are much the same or a kept alive by government ownership and subsidies.  The Middle Eastern airlines pay no tax in their own countries.  Asian airlines rely on cheap labour at every level, including technical crew (pilots) and incidents are frequent.  And anyone who believes that allowing foreign airlines on northern routes will result in rapid (or any) market growth live on another planet.Australia has the least protected airlines on this planet and our airlines manage to provide quality service in very difficult circumstances and generally they make a profit.  To believe that foreign airlines with their bad management practices, reliance on governments and just plain rotten service can revolutionise air travel in Australia is to believe in fairies at the bottom of the garden.This idea is typical of the befuddled, nonsensical, and just plain stupid policies of the present Australian government!

26 May 2015 5:50:07pmBob Hawke had no hesitation in removing the airline cabotage during the '80s pilots strike, calling them 'glorified bus drivers'. We had any number of international carriers operating on domestic flights. It worked a treat then, and can work again now. Same with shipping: overpaid maritime unionists driving up local costs - it's incredible what Australians pay for everyday products compared to other countries.

26 May 2015 6:08:07pmAustralia will never be able to compete with our production sapping union mandated and unrealistic OH&S laws.Two examples today two men holding stop go flags while another two plant a 2 meter tree in the nature strip three meters from the curb.Another example a private contractor delivering king single bed to my home just lifted it on his shoulder and walked into the bedroom. If a union was involved he would not have been allowed to do that and the delivery cost would be at least double. Giving the high cost of housing if the unions had control of the domestic housing market just think how much higher the building cost would be if independent contractors were not involved. Labor is the party of the union movement and they will always support protectionism to the determent of the Australian consumer.

26 May 2015 7:07:16pmAnd yet Australia was more than able to compete in the post war years when its middle class was created and union power at its zenith.And in Bangla Desh where there are no unions or OH & S issues (where workers burn to death) conditions are so bad that its people are filling the boats trying to escape from that 'competitive" country.So how come Germany and Scandinavia which have high wages, unions  and  OH & S compete?Do you think management and ideology  may have something to do with it?.

26 May 2015 6:25:25pmThis is our country.  We shouldn't be afraid to make whatever rules we deem to be appropriate.  If we want rules that ensure a fair suck of the sav for everyone then so be it - that's democracy for you.  If you don't like it then move to one of many third world countries where workers aren't protected and most people are beggared while the rich drive by in their limousines. But if you want deregulation, and you want to stay here, then why not get really serious and start spruiking anarchism? After all, it's not as if most of us want or would agree to live in a country that only removes rules that protect workers and the poor while simultaneously imposing and enhancing laws that only protect the rich.If Berg, or anyone else, wants more deregulation then they should be willing to go the full monty.  I'm all for it.Because anarchism for all would be better than a twisted, sick and debased form of anarchism that frees the rich to exploit whomever and whatever they like (and ruin the commons in the process) while simultaneously imposing a heavy and increasingly one sided burden on the poor.

26 May 2015 8:23:01pmThere are pros and cons for deregulation. My own experience as an exporter is that the international freight costs for sending a 20' container to China is less than Half the cost of transporting the equivalent by land from say Melbourne to Brisbane . Not only is road freight transport far more expensive for transporting goods it does not reflect the costs of far greater ongoing destruction of road infrastructure by heavy transport which is subsidised by taxpayers through constant repair and the need to massively over engineer road infrastructure. Environmentally exploiting the benefits of shipping may have many benefits over road transport of heavy freight and many dry goods.There are likely some major benefits to be had in some areas like capital city shipping that only have upsides for just about every -AustralianI hope this issue can be examined clinically and without prejudgment .

26 May 2015 11:27:04pmThat 'protectionist' is widely held as perjorative reflects the feeble imagination of what is 'right' in modern political economics.Every economy is the sum of a great number of parts, all of which act determinedly to protect their identity as a fundamental part of what they have to do to be able to participate in the machinations of the market.Economies do similarly and should do.  Larger economies are more soundly based when they are built up of robust parts.Indeed larger entities should be concerned if their sub-elements do not act to secure their identities.This means a measure of protectionism is important from every perspective in the economy. The questions are rather what protection and how much is desirable.The natural analogue is fitness.  Economies and their parts need to work on their fitness.What is not needed is that they work on their brutality, their overbearingness.  Crushing out potentially vibrant parts of any economy is an anti-economic behaviour.  Economies are always better served by being marginally over-supportive than being even marginally over-destructive.  When it is taken beyond its capacities for invigoration, competition is a debilitating practice, one that seeks to maintain a much less than optimal economic healthiness.If we want healthy societies we need that they have healthy economies and fostering the mindset that the brutish behaviours of thug-elements in economies is good economics is patent stupidity.

27 May 2015 12:04:51amAhhh the old utopian deregulation dream. Trade in your tired old workplace rights for the promise of gettin' rich quick. Throw out all that gubmint red tape, rules and regulations along with the commies that support it and replace it all with TPP global corporate red tape, rules and regulations and their own security and legal dept to enforce them. Big improvement. Much better. I mean, it worked so well in the US, particularly for the financial sector after scrapping Glass Steagall in 1980, but also for the labour market, where low paid illicit workers with no recourse to justice did especially well. Just imagine where they'd be without those advances. Too awful to even contemplate.

27 May 2015 5:09:58amCompetition is hailed and venerated almost in every field of human endeavour it seems. When one is young and vital it is such a thrill and often a demanding phase in one's development and maturity, hopefully.But I shudder when 'competition' is not regulated.All the sports that have had declined in shine and that special tenor of the gifted amateur especially in all fields is something I very much miss.Being 'professional' has become such a catch-cry and manic drive within the archness of our competitive capitalistic variously democratic world of 'nations' that I now shudder with this article's putsch.I think and feel that 'competition' has to be moderated just like the internet.  But then, I suspect that moderating 'today' has got steadily weaker and further behind than ever before.  Maybe we are approaching 'a time' when anarchy of machismo will outstrip all sense and reality (in this world) of perceived individual welfare.So, I am not saying 'no' to universal competition at all, but I am saying 'yes' to rigorous robust moderation!  Ah!  such balance and identity achieved!

27 May 2015 6:17:45amIn the debate about protectionism nothing brings a smile to my face quicker than the assertion that Australia can only compete on the world's markets by turning the place into a "low wage utopia" for the mega wealthy.  The pure unvarnished truth is that low wages usually come at a cost to the economies they supposedly support. Even the Communist governments of the Soviet Union and more latterly China have recognised without   well supported domestic demand your economy will eventually flounder. Truth be known there is only so much a low cost country can achieve selling into export markets before the whole thing becomes uneconomic and China has begun to take steps to rely more on its domestic demand rather than give away pricing for its goods in race to the bottom markets becoming common in entities like the proposed TPP.  Sensible regulation, far from strangling trade supports it and Australia needs to be pressing for fair and equitable outcomes rather than bursting a boiler to sign up at any cost to whatever clauses vested interests have in gaining unfettered access to our markets. If the truth be known MAJOR impediments stand in the way of Australian companies trying to compete in some overseas markets which are touted as "paragons of virtue" in supposedly free markets.  Make no mistake overseas markets are NOT free from financial "protection" and other measures designed to drive up the price of Australian goods imported into those markets. Interestingly those same countries do not see the need for Australia to apply similar restrictions.   Mr Berg makes the point that "freeing up markets" some how turns functions like air-travel and maritime services into models of ideal industrial relations and efficiency.  Will he be quite so willing to support these measures in relation to employment standards , WHS laws and compliance with other requirements . In truth I would willingly pay a little more for my airline tickets and goods with a cost input from domestic maritime services than depend on some organisations who would demand access to Australian markets. My final point is that many of those so strongly advocating the 457 visa utopia are themselves comfortably established in "totally protected" occupations. Try setting up as a dentist, doctor, lawyer or similar professional without meeting the requirements of the organisations which represent these people.  The essential point is that these restrictions are absolutely necessary but somehow practical measures applied to the employment conditions of others are a totally different case and simply an impediment to Australia's economy.

27 May 2015 2:10:50pmBefore you start stripping away any of the layers of protection from any good or service produced in Australia. You need to look at the levels of protection and restrictions in place for Australian business in other  countries. Its fine and dandy to want everything without restrictions being in place but can you do the exact same business in another country. I think not. For example in Thailand a foreigner cannot own property or can a foreigner own 100% of their own company. In other countries there are numerous other restrictions in place to deter or impede a foreigner from conducting trade in many other ways.. So for all of those who want to open the floodgates for free trade and without tariffs, Please ensure that the playing field is equal first that you have free trade as well into other countries.
