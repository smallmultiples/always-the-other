In front of a packed gallery, the Glamorgan Spring Bay Council has voted in support of the controversial Cambria Green tourism development. It was a tense first meeting for the newly elected council, but with its backing, the development will now go to the Tasmanian Planning Commission (TPC).Cambria Green, a huge project proposed to be built at Dolphin Sands on Tasmania's east coast, has been controversial since it was first announced in April.The vision of its Chinese and Australian investors is for 70 villas, 240 units and a 120-room luxury hotel built on 3,185 hectares, not to mention a golf course and a crematorium.Fully occupied, the population of the proposed "eco-resort" would dwarf the population of nearby Swansea.Newly elected councillor Rob Churchill sought to halt the proposal and his motion was seconded by another new councillor, Keith Breheny.Both had been told by council staff in the days prior that they had a conflict of interest due to their previously stated opposition to the proposal.At the Tuesday's night's meeting they spoke and voted anyway."I believe that my ethics and my honesty are more important than legal advice," Councillor Breheny said."If somebody wants to challenge me on what I did, the fact that I might be subject to a breach of the code of conduct, I'm willing to take that and be able to represent the people I really care about."Cr Annie Browning, a third newly elected member who received the same advice, did declare an interest and left the room.In the end, the motion to reject the development outright was defeated 4-3.  New Mayor Debbie Wisby also voted against the Cambria Green development.A vote was then taken to support the amendments to the council's planning scheme that would permit rezoning agricultural land to effectively allow a new township to be built.It too was passed 4-3. While the 58 locals who had come to watch the meeting were largely against the proposal there was also a significant population of the east coast who see the jobs and economic activity the proposal would bring as something worth supporting. For those against the proposal, the battleground moves to the planning commission."I think it's probably good that it's now out of the council arena and going to the TPC â€” it's been an incredibly contentious issue." said East Coast Alliance president Anne Held.Ms Held believed that the Planning Commission may share her group's opposition to Cambria Green."They could reject it in its totality," she said.Mayor Wisby now has to adjust to representing the council's view rather than her own."Even though a lot of people wouldn't like the result, I think it was a step that needed to happen," she said."My personal opinion doesn't come into it now council's voted. That's the decision."The TPC will hear the application for the rezoning in the months ahead.
