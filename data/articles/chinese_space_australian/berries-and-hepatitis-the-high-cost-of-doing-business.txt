The calamity of people apparently contracting hepatitis from frozen berries is partly a consequence of Australia's high cost of doing business, writes Alan Kohler.The calamity that befell Patties Foods a week and a half ago, along with the 18 people who have apparently contracted hepatitis from its berries, is partly a consequence of Australia's high cost of doing business.Fresh raspberries, sourced from Australia, sell for $40 and $50 per kilogram and everyone's happy.But as soon as a berry is frozen it becomes a globally-tradeable commodity. As a result, and even though the product has had energy applied to it and it comes from far away, the price falls to $9 per kg.At that price, Australia is out of the game: the wages of pickers and packers, plus regulatory costs, are simply too high.And Australia's family businesses are at the front line of this problem, struggling to stay in business as they try to compete against cheap imports, ushered in by free trade agreements and a currency that the RBA describes as still overvalued.Patties is a listed family business, still controlled by the six sons of the founders, Peter and Annie Rijs who opened their cake shop in Lakes Entrance in 1966.The Rijs' pies were so good and so successful, the company ended up buying the national market leader in pies, Four 'n' Twenty, in 2003, and with the pies came Nanna's frozen berries.Patties now supplies, or at least did a fortnight ago, half the frozen berry market through its two brands, Nanna's and Creative Gourmet, which was bought in 2007. Sales have been growing at 40 per cent a year because of a boom in smoothies and products like NutriBullet blenders, and because the frozen product is so much cheaper than fresh.It has become a 14,000 tonne, $140 million a year, product line for supermarkets, according to the CEO of Patties Foods, Steven Chaur - and an entirely imported commodity.And then Friday afternoon a week ago, Chaur, who's been in job 10 months, got the phone call that everyone in the food business dreads.The Health Department rang to say that four people had contracted hepatitis A and the only common link between them was that they had each bought Nanna's frozen mixed berries. More tests had to be done, but it was conclusive enough for a press release to be issued.Suddenly many lives were turned upside down: Steven Chaur's, the six Rijs brothers, especially former CEO Richard and Harry, who represent the family on the board, everyone else connected with the company, and everyone else in the frozen food industry.Chaur issued a recall of the mixed berries and then next day extended that to Nanna's raspberries and, as a precaution, the Creative Gourmet line as well. All of the berries are grown in Chile and China, and are frozen and packed in China.The company, of course, is still in crisis and Steven Chaur says it's too early to tell what the recovery plan will be; he's still focusing on those who got sick and testing the products to find out what happened. Obviously he is looking at the sources of supply, and at rebranding the products, as well as significantly increasing testing in future.But this could also be a game changing event for labelling laws: it's unlikely that "made in Australia with local and imported ingredients" is going to cut it anymore. You'd have to think that labelling would have to be much clearer and more precise in future.It's not just Patties that is suffering - sales of frozen berries generally have crashed, although one small supplier in New Zealand who I spoke to, Robert Auton of OOB Organic, told me that the supermarkets had increased their orders simply to fill the empty shelves.Interestingly, Auton and his wife Shannon have just got a big export order for frozen berries from China last week, which they are now trying to fill.So maybe there could be a future for organic, or just plain clean, frozen berry exports back to China and other Asian countries, although there are few, if any suppliers in Australia who could do it.As Avrom Gamaroff, whose family owns a Sydney-based frozen berry wholesaler, Harvestime, told me this week: "There is no frozen berry industry in Australia.""Local farmers will not snap freeze their berries - it's not viable. Why would they do it when they sell for $50 a kilo fresh and $10 frozen?"Gamaroff brings his berries in from Chile, China, Europe and America, and supplies restaurants and the food services industry. Like everyone else in the industry, he's watching what happens to Patties with keen interest because the resolution will affect everyone.Astonishingly, something similar has happened to the monumental masonry business Australia - over the past decade, stone has become a tradeable commodity, like frozen berries.Peter Layton owns a stone masonry business he inherited from his father. Fifteen years ago he used to cut all his own gravestones using granite sourced mainly from Australia, as well as elsewhere in the world when a special looking product was needed.Now all of Australia's gravestones are brought in from China, already cut. The local masons simply do the lettering.Layton says there are four Chinese importers that now supply the entire Australian market. Their prices are about 30 per cent cheaper than his were, and so the 30 factory workers he used to employ cutting gravestones are now four people who do lettering and deal with bereaved clients. Peter Layton is hanging in as a small retailer instead of the big wholesaler he used to be.What's more it is now virtually impossible to buy locally quarried bluestone for paving and gardens - almost all of it is now imported from China.Once thriving quarries dotted around Australia are now idle because what they produced has become a globally-traded commodity and they can't compete.There is a quality issue in this business too: stonemasons and landscape gardeners say that the imported bluestone and granite is not as good as the Australian product, although at least it doesn't make you sick - it just wears out sooner.So family businesses like Patties Foods and Layton Stone, both founded at about the same time, are in the vanguard of Australia's battle to be competitive.But they can't win. Australia's costs are so high that a lump of granite dug up in China, or a bag of raspberries grown in Chile, are cheaper than granite and raspberries from just up the road.And that is not going to change until their prices go up to meet ours: as I wrote the other day, the underlying problem is high prices for housing and things like gas and electricity, none of which will come down soon.In the meantime the authorities here simply have to make sure that the imported products are up to scratch and corners are not being cut.And, yes, that means red tape.Alan Kohler is a finance presenter on ABC News.

26 Feb 2015 4:48:43pmAnd it is "weasel words" that Alan is using to spin a contamination problem with imported berries into a whine about Australian "red tape" and "high cost of doing business".Perhaps Alan we could just stop importing the cheaper, infected berries and let the economies of scale to take effect here in Australia.What if a member of your family got crook Alan? Is it always about the bottom line?I can buy a punnet of fresh strawberries down the road for less the $5 and often less than that on special, blueberries and other berries are not available as often but they are around the same price when in season. Australian berries.If there is a market then the producers will increase production and with increased production prices will fall and then guess what, they will freeze them.Cheaper is not always better.

27 Feb 2015 12:25:07amPaul01:I agree with what Alan is saying. I also agree with what you're saying in that "Cheaper is not always better".But we can't simply stop trade and become a reclusive nation. What we need to offer other nations in exports needs to be properly marketed, our products need to be shining emblems of the rich cultural, high quality and sensible advantages we have here.Germany for instance has a reputation for precision and high specification goods, amplified by good solid government decision making and Merkels image of no-nonsense quality - such that I know a few who imported windows from there because they had the opinion they were better than any in Australia when they were building a house.And this is why I think Tony Abbott and the Liberals are so damaging - his bumbling nature and clumsy manner combined with the short-sightedness and nasty language of his Liberals has far reaching effects on how other nations view our products. I have no doubt the international headlines don't do the image of our products any good.

27 Feb 2015 7:01:49amAlan is discussing input costs: and rightly so.If we cannot (or at least should not) pay workers less so that we compete, we need to address 'non-wage input costs' to promote competitiveness.  The irony is that our 300 000 per year migrant intake (net, not gross) is designed to do the former, but mostly fails, and in the process pushes up house prices and incidentally imposes huge  infrastructure costs (which mean more demand on scarce capital, pushing up foreign indebtedness and interest rates, and encourages governments to cut services to pay for foreigner-driven infrastructure).  Another fail, unless you are our second rate businesses who need more people to underpin sales - bugger innovation.Trouble is, we all WANT this crisis: no one is willing to swallow even stable house prices as it means real house price declines.

26 Feb 2015 5:48:23pmTC, free trade agreements have killed untold local businesses, local jobs and local wealth. The beneficiaries of free trade are big mining and big agribusiness which provide far fewer jobs and far less local wealth than the local producers, processors and manufacturers who have been killed off by the last 35 years of free trade fundamentalism.Free trade erodes consumer protection, is environmentally destructive, leads to overproduction and exploits foreign workers. The cheaper price we pay for imports is paid for dearly in the third world country of production.

26 Feb 2015 10:28:06pmso if that is the case overall why is our unemployment rate far below that of the late 70's, 80s and 90's? Sure some have been hit badly by free trade (the textile, clothing and foot wear industry that used to be here would be the prime example) but for all of that our economy employs more people now than pre-free trade.
Alert moderator
27 Feb 2015 9:39:09amfirthy, the current unemployment rate is around the same as the 70's. It spiked severely from the 80's through to the 00's from where it gradually decreased. The reason unemployment has settled below the 80's is to be found in the rate of underemployment. Roy Morgan estimates that unemployment and underemployment are hovering around the 20%.The real unemployment figure is around 10% while underemployment is another 9.6%. The official unemployment rate fails to account for those who require work but cannot claim benefits.
Alert moderator
27 Feb 2015 10:07:29amBecause the unemployment figures are bogus, cooked to make politicians look good.  In the periods you refer to, someone was recorded as unemployed if they were looking for a job - and in those days a job meant full time work.  The only people who worked part time were mums trying to fit in a little job around school hours.  These days you AREN'T unemployed if you worked for ONE HOUR a week.  You are now "underemployed".  That's why the unemployment figures appear so low, they are not reflective of the reality.

26 Feb 2015 6:40:23pmTC, I can't see how Australian farmers can, or should - for public health reasons, compete with edible plant products grown in 'night soil' as fertilizer, and picked by A$2/hr labor. The details of the free trade agreement are kept from the public for a reason. If we knew the details of it, the people responsible for signing us up to it would be as popular as something floating in your backyard pool.Do google 'night soil', but not before you are about to eat.
Alert moderator
27 Feb 2015 2:22:32pmThe problem is that most Australians are not prepared / able to pay the cost of 'Australian Made' goods.Imagine the popularity of a politician who increased tariffs on products to cover the cost of doing business in Australia (e.g. wages, taxes, energy prices, environment policies, etc.). I'd suggest the outcry at finding clothes, electronics, etc. dramatically jumping in price would be noisy. People's living standards would fall dramatically.

26 Feb 2015 5:12:09pmThanks Alan for directly linking this food quality issue with FTAs. Even the Greens seemed reluctant to draw the link. There are plenty of losers with FTAs, as Alan points out, to go with the obvious benefits of choice & price. For some reason consumers appear to put price far ahead of all other considerations when buying a product. It's what we've been trained to do as consumers.However the TPP will be truly frightening if, as reports suggest, corporates will be able to override a country's sovereign laws (eg. environmental protections).

26 Feb 2015 7:33:54pmWhat do you mean its what we've been trained to do. Are you suggesting consumers wouldn't seek value for their dollar unless they were trained? As for FTAs costing jobs, that is a very limited argument. It may cost jobs in some sectors but create many more in others. I find it amusing how many self-proclaimed 'progressives' love being stuck in past practices and reluctant to move with the times. Sounds very conservative to me.

26 Feb 2015 8:35:41pmOf course cost should be a consideration! It is one thing to spend a couple of dollars extra on Australian fruit, but 4 times as much?People have to be able to afford to buy the stuff.
Alert moderator
27 Feb 2015 2:51:54pmPeople buy the stuff fresh. They would buy it frozen at the same prices or similar if they *knew* it was better quality. But they don't know. I had no conception previously that Australian grown would be any better than grown in Chile. Now that product safety issues have come to light I'm sure the label "Australian grown" on any frozen fruit product will be worth a premium.Remember that berries are not bread or butter; that is, they are a discretionary product, which is one of the types people are most willing to pay high prices for if they feel the quality is worth it.

26 Feb 2015 6:40:28pmId like a simple solution of having a circle with an Australian picture (any).  Using a simple pie chart show how much of the item in Australian with a number above or below.  It should be very closely known for tax purposes already.  If in any doubt, underestimating should occur.  100% could keep a full koala, kangaroo, flag, coat of arms or whatever else.  The rest have it in black and white with a clear number printed.

26 Feb 2015 7:14:46pmI wouldn't be surprised but as a consumer (and cook and consumer of food) I want clear labelling so I can make my choice. I can avoid anything I think might be a problem then. I try to buy local fruit and veg, but I also love many frozen products, including berries.
Alert moderator
27 Feb 2015 2:53:31pmI also love frozen products, but not for their cheaper price but because it means we can have berries year round. This Hep A scare will hopefully be capitalised on by local growers who can justify their 4x higher price by assuring consumers it is grown here.

26 Feb 2015 4:15:33pmThe reality is that global trading as it's done is just unfair on any country that allows its citizens to live the life that everybody wants to lead.The fed gov wants to get rid of penalty rates and generally lower pays of workers (while maintaining the stupidly high profits of the companies the workers are making the money for) pointing to wages as being too high to compete but it's much deeper than this.Even if wages lowered China and India would just make the product cheaper to keep competitors out of the market.That's because India is so far away from catching up to the same standard of living and wages that allow it to do this for a long time to come and China is a command economy and are able to manipulate how it does things to ensure it can always undercut all other Western style economies.The problem really is we the consumer. Is being able to buy anything we want so cheaply that we're destroying our kids future really worth it?Perhaps we the consumers really should re-think our every day thinking and return to insisting on buying locally or not all if possible if there is no exact alternative?Perhaps in the case of berries if we are so concerned with our health that we need to have smoothies for breakfast we should also consider Australia's countries economic health and future of our kids and buy fresh berries from now on.Yes, they cost more but we do after all have the wages that enable us to make these choices.

26 Feb 2015 6:13:11pm"Even if wages lowered China and India would just make the product cheaper to keep competitors out of the market."I doubt it. China and India pay their workers a pittance to begin with. If they started cutting these wages further, they'd have riots on their hands, especially with fuel and food costs on the rise. "Yes, they cost more but we do after all have the wages that enable us to make these choices."If our economy is unable to compete with our third-world neighbours, it's only a matter of time before we swap places with them and lose our massive wages.
Alert moderator
26 Feb 2015 7:26:40pmNope, Chine has economic regions, some are allowed to improve while others are deliberately kept behind. This allows China to always have a reserve of cheap labor to call upon no matter what the market they're competing with.Lower wages here in Australia will never be able to fall low enough to compete and that's really that regardless of what ideology drives "free market" thinking.I work at a place that is owned by Indians. We make things here in Australia, they'd love to make these things we make here in India  but there are legal reasons that prevent them so they can't.The legal reasons are basically that they can't make what they'd like to with the quality that it must be made to.So in this particular case their cheap labor isn't of help to them so they're trying to make the labor here in Aust cheap but all that's doing is preventing the company from getting the trained people because they wont pay what the jobs are worth.It wont work out as they're hoping because quality will fall and there will be problems in the long run.Are the "free market" ideologues suggesting that trained people get paid the same as an Indian worker or Chinese worker?Who are these  ideologues and what makes them think that they will be immune from the deleterious effects of lowering wages? The simple fact is the "free market" was and never will be a realistic way of doing business because no matter what wages do in the West eventually all manufacturing will end up in China and India and the ideologues now saying we get lean and mean and compete or fail are having themselves on.
Alert moderator
27 Feb 2015 2:58:10pmZing, your solution IS for us to swap places with them. The only way capitalism can see us compete is to become impoverished ourselves.It is rejection of capitalistic principles like free trade and the pursuit of profit overall that will allow us to make a softer landing into a lower, but still comfortable, quality of living.And one of the *main* drivers for that will be reducing the price of real estate. That is what keeps wages and prices so high!

26 Feb 2015 4:18:21pmThank you Alan. Your last paragraph "And, yes, that means red tape." will make Tony angry as he has been trying to undo red tape by the mile, but if the outcome of the berries incident will be a regular outcome of red tape removal, then we need the red tape.Abbott is resisting country of origin labelling as much as he can but he has 2 ministers in the govt. pushing ahead with it. Now I see he is saying the cost to business will have to be taken into account so that means we wont get what we the voters have been asking for years, or we will get such a wishy washy label that will be meaningless.It really is about time Sir "Puts his foot in the mouth a lot" Abbott does something the people want & not what business might want. Make the country of origin label show exactly what's in it & where it all came from & where it was packed. In other words we want proper & easy to read & understand labelling, not next year or sometime in the future but right now.

26 Feb 2015 5:45:35pmNo - he is talking about producers (growers) who are NOT in Australia. It is not viable to produce berries for the frozen market in Australia because our costs are too high.I simply lamented that it was a pity that this type of article was not written before the introduction of the CT which made those costs even higher.It does not surprise me that you haven't a clue what I am talking about.
Alert moderator
26 Feb 2015 11:10:56pmSo, Esteban, are you suggesting that the cost of frozen berries would have fallen to one fifth of the cost of fresh berries had it not been for the CT?Really, compared to everything else, the CT was peanuts.  A far greater driver for the high cost of living in Australia is the unrealistic price of real estate.
Alert moderator
27 Feb 2015 12:33:41pmNo I am not suggesting that. With or without the CT we are way off the market for frozen berries.What I am suggesting is that the next time the topic of CT comes up, presumably after Turnbull is leader, some of the discussion should be about how the cost of it will impact business.What we had last time was how it would impact on consumers/voters who had received compensation.Of course there are plenty of high costs associated with being in business that have a greater impact than the CT but there is little we can do about them. Even if it is peanuts why would you legislate to make an already expensive country that bit more expensive?For some businesses the CT was not peanuts.
Alert moderator
26 Feb 2015 4:52:54pmFunny stuff Esteban.It was the high dollar that drove exporters off shore, you can blame the miners and the lack of a fair dinkum mining tax.The price on carbon was a blip in comparison to the damage the high dollar did.
Alert moderator
26 Feb 2015 6:01:05pmyes I agree Paul but we had little control over the dollar. No one in business blamed the Government for the high dollar.It is galling for your costs to increase as a result of your government. A kick in the guts.The CT impact varied from business to business. The high dollar made it close to impossible for local food producers to pass on the cost of the CT because they were competing against cheap imports because of the high dollar.The Government knew we had a high dollar when they increased costs to local businesses via the CT. We were also dealing with a GFC and slowly increasing unemployment. Consumers were compensated for costs that were largely not passed on by business.There are very few opportunities to present things from the perspective of a businessman on the drum so I took this opportunity when it arose. As a result I think my thread is justified. At the risk of incurring the wrath of pocket rye for going off thread, are you suggesting that we would not have had a mining boom if we had had a mining tax?
Alert moderator
27 Feb 2015 7:06:42amthe mostly unstated intent f the mining tax was to reign in the frothy mining boom.  Abbott repealed it and you could well say that he too is guilty of the following: "It is galling for your costs to increase as a result of your government. A kick in the guts."
Alert moderator
27 Feb 2015 12:39:08pmThe reason it was unstated is because the ALP went to great pains to state the exact opposite. They claimed that it would have no impact on mining investment in Australia.The ALP mining tax cost more to administer than it collected.

26 Feb 2015 4:26:06pmAlan Kohler is spot on. Australian industry is under siege from lower wages overseas, cheaper quality goods and a compliant big business who would sell their grandmothers for a buck.I distribute a range of Australian made products, and we are being killed by cheaper priced (and quality) products, sourced out of Asia.Hepatitis scares notwithstanding, my beef is with inadequate product labelling laws. As a consumer, I want to know where my purchases come from, so that I can select the Australian made equivalent. Misleading labelling does not show what proportion of goods "sourced from imported and local products" are actually Australian, and goods labelled "product of New Zealand" are often sourced from China and packaged in New Zealand.The irony of our fresh food produce, is that much of it is exported to China to cater for a growing middle class, who will not buy the locally made product. So while the Chinese get our good stuff, we get what they reject, and risk the resultant health risks.Where are the voices of our political classes on this topic...silent, as they deem foreign kids in detention to be a worthier cause.

26 Feb 2015 4:26:54pmSo a 140 million dollars a year product is allowed to come into the country with no controls on how it is produced and somehow this is the fault of Australian farmers??  It appears to me, like many successful companies, there appeared to be a failure to treat their product as anything more than a money maker. Standards were not adequate and were not enforced. Why?? Simply profit and the fear of competition. It is high time we went back to a tarriff based system. It is impossible to be globally competitive when companies hold employees to ransom in China and if at some time the costs of labor do rise companies simply move to a different province or country lock, stock and barrel leaving their employees with nothing, usually failing to provide the contractual benefits they are owed. Australia, like many nations were conned about the benefits of free global trade. No product should be allowed in to our country unless it meets Australias standards, including standards of employee remuneration and treatment. Anything less is just a lowering of global standards overall.

27 Feb 2015 3:03:16pmBy "banned overseas" you almost certainly mean banned in the EU, but not in the USA.Unfortunately the USA is who we often take our banning lead from, in both additives and medications. And it is the USA whose lead we follow into FTAs. And crony capitalism. And, well, everything bad, really. Maybe we should be paying more attention to what Europe does.

26 Feb 2015 6:11:18pmI would honestly be suprised if the processing plant/s in China did not have some sort of internationally recognised certification on food standards. Even if the Australian company involved in this outbreak had representatives over in China testing the product, could they have prevented this? You can't test every berry.Any system of consuming food touched by another person, regardless of the level of standards involved, boils down to trust in the end.

27 Feb 2015 5:01:41pmpolly I am honestly surprised that anyone still thinks that some Chinese factories that pass standards tests don't change what they're doing the week after the inspectors leave.Sure, lots of them play fair. But as long as some are breaking the laws people will keep viewing Chinese products as bad news.Even other Chinese people don't want to eat some Chinese-made food. That tells you everything you need to know.

26 Feb 2015 4:38:42pmThe crux of the problem is people want cheap stuff, and want it now. As others have pointed out the whole notion of seasonable produce has gone out the window. I want my berries, I want them cheap, I want them all year round. So we turn a blind eye and just hope it's all OK. When it's not OK we blame the supermarket chains, or the guvmint, never ourselves.I won't hold my breathe but I hope, at least better labelling laws come in. I try to buy local and fresh, I never by buy 'made in China' but the 'from local and imported ingredients' is just a joke, it's absolutely meaningless. I am by no means rich, so some stuff we get only rarely, and that's OK.And just maybe people will take a bit more responsibility about what they ingest, and realise you can't have it all, and you get what you pay for. But probably not.

Alert moderator
27 Feb 2015 3:06:12pmActually I don't think price is as big a factor here. People are willing to pay for quality, what happened was that the labelling did NOT give people the information on quality that they needed.Remember that Patties had two brands: Nannas and Creative Gourmet, and there were stark price differences between them for what was essentially the same product in a fancier box.If companies had to label the actual countries their products came from price would cease to be as much of an advantage for them.
Alert moderator
27 Feb 2015 4:06:05pmWGT, you have overlooked the problem of reliable fruit quality.  Much Australian fruit is picked green for future ripening and shipped extraordinary distances for sale.  Often the only way to get luscious fresh fruit is to either grow your own or befriend someone who does.By the time "fresh" berries have been shipped from the farm via the wholesale market to your friendly greengrocer they are no longer fresh (weeping/mouldy berries in a small $8 punnet are a dismal sight, especially when just you've brought them home).  Soggy frozen berries are never as good as fresh "fresh" berries, but at least, despite the odd hepatitis-A outbreak, they are a reliable product.

26 Feb 2015 5:03:21pmIf China is now looking to us to source clean, frozen berries for them and our producers won't because the low cost doesn't pay, surely there is a market for chilled berries, exported by air to meet the high end market in China?  This works for other Aussie fresh produce that are flown out of Adelaide, Melbourne and other ports daily.  Today I saw fresh, localblueberries at $6.99 a 250 gm punnet in Adelaide's Central Market.  Maybe the Chinese would like some of these and would pay more for the privilege?  Flown out of Adelaide at lunchtime they would be in Shanghai about 11 hours later.  Chilling, not freezing, keeps them fresh but you must get them to market before too long.

26 Feb 2015 5:04:59pmAlan, I take strong issue with "the wages of pickers and packers, plus regulatory costs, are simply too high."I have worked in the agriculture and associated industries...the pay is, with few exceptions, the minimum wage. When piece rate was involved, even equivalent to minimum wage was hard to achieve.Your statement, unqualified and in isolation, that the minimum wage is 'too high' is nonsense. It is not a living wage, and all the more so in seasonal industries.Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that 'overseas wages are too low for us to compete'.And there's the real problem..
Alert moderator
27 Feb 2015 3:20:18amNot only are overseas wages too low for us to compete, but there is also no price on environmental damage. This is not just an agricultural problem.  The long term quality of many products made overseas is also much lower than previously Australian made.  Look at how long copper pipe lasts now, and stainless steel seems to have lost the 'stainless' component.Free trade should only be allowed if we are free trading the same quality, safety and environmental costs.

27 Feb 2015 3:09:20pmOverseas wages are too low for us to compete because none of us want to live like people do in many parts of Asia and India.When people cry for getting rid of the minimum wage, what they are really asking for is to get rid of the minimum standards of living.

26 Feb 2015 5:07:15pmI will happily pay more for my frozen berries if I can be assured that they are sourced locally. After all it is the convenience of having them on hand when the fresh variety is not available and of having them keep far longer than the fresh variety do. Yes the berries may be cheaper from countries with cheaper wages but I believe that everyone is entitled to a living wage and that food should be bought from closer to home to help reduce our carbon footprint. It's like those $3 t-shirts in K Mart. If an item is too cheap no-one values it and wastage increases. If it costs more then the opposite occurs. We value how much effort it takes us to earn the money to pay for whatever it is and as a result will look after that item better.

26 Feb 2015 5:11:17pmA little while ago, I posted on the Drum in relation to Chinese buying our agricultural land. I tried to discuss the possibility of contaminating neighbouring properties due to shoddy practice.I was against it...What I found quite alarming was the not the number of people who rushed in to defend Chinese practice, but how many of these people kept pointing out  just how damn good Chinese product is - especially eye phones.Now that this has occured ( and my friend in western Victoria is one of the victims), I don't wish to say "I told you so", or someting equally trite.What I would like to do, however, is to ask you all, at what point do we stick up for ourselves? At what point do we decide that we do (or don't) want to live in this cess pool our politicians are creating for us as a result of their being "lobbied"?We have already had diseased ginger permitted into the country, now its contaminated berries. Are we, as a nation of AUSTRALIANS going to just roll over?Seeing as we still don't have any idea of the implications of the impending TPP, are we going to make a noise?Or have we decided its better to just let the multi-nationals make profit hand over fist at our expense?

26 Feb 2015 6:42:05pmThank you Alan.I have made it my business never to buy Chinese food products (even processed there) and try to avoid Chinese goods where possible. Imagine my surprise that my freezer full of blueberries may have been from China (they do say Chile) having already consumed a few mixed berry bags. We have nonsensical labelling laws. Yes I do want to know where it is grown and where it is processed. Even original local brand biscuits are made in China; I just don't buy those brands.I'm not anti Chinese; I have a 20yo microwave from China that still goes strongly. If only they made to that standard today I would buy all Chinese; long way to go before I would knowingly buy Chinese food products.We are our own worst enemy when it comes to competitiveness and wonder why we fall by the wayside. Start with the bureaucracy like local Councils or the CO2 taxes which would have wiped out many viable industries. We still have RET! We just lumber ourselves with costs without clear, relevant objectives. We can always plant some more money trees in the Gibson Desert and pretend that we can harvest the fruit in years to come; meanwhile just spend to our heart's content and believe we can be competitive. It won't be long before we are out of the G20.

26 Feb 2015 7:27:10pmHepatitis and berries has nothing to do with the cost of doing business in a globalised trading world. If a commodity can be sourced elsewhere more cheaply that is what is going to happen.  If you are selling a product and it makes your customers sick - that is not a good way to run any business.  Too much trust in your suppliers in an agricultural and industrial environment less regulated and one that is more corruptible at any time is a recipe for disaster at some time.  Many months ago when this company changed labeling from USA and Chile origins to the non-info "Packed in Australia using Imported Ingredients' cop out, I wrote to them stating that I would not purchase their products if they exclude specific Country of Origin data.Their response spoke of their difficulty of changing packaging for each source country - nonsense of course. Why not print packs for each country from which they source bulk product? When the shipping container says from country XYZ, you change the packs! Surely that much value could be added by the Packed in Australia process! They went on to assure me that their Quality Control with suppliers was such that their product, regardless of source, was of the consistently highest standard.Unfortunately, with the brand killing health revelations of recent times, this statement has also proved nonsense, more in line with a PR release than a realistic assessment of the risk from some countries' agricultural, food and industrial standards.Country of Origin labeling is a minimum requirement for any food product sold in Australia, wherever sourced, to simply give consumers the choice.  A leveling of the playing field would occur if importers were required to certify the safety of the products they are packing or distributing in the same way that local manufacturers are.

26 Feb 2015 9:03:46pmHaving worked in the international food industry, I can say that the prime reason why Australian produce is more expensive than imported is due to supply chain mandatory health controls such as HACCP for processors, NLIS for animal producers etc overseen by Local, State and Federal Government bodies.  The cost is substantial and ongoing for every animal and processing batch. Consumers of Australian grown and processed products are assured that the authorities are able to trace the supply chain for all local ingredients. If a food is under question we are able to identify the farm that the food was grown, the place it was processed and all pesticides, fertilisers additives used in bringing the raw product to market. The HACCP controls provide pathway information for time and method of processing. If you add the Australian Standard ticks onto this process there are volumes of checks and balances.While in Asia, I found few of these controls in place, save for export controls at the country of origin and import controls at our end. Systems is in place which relies on compliance by the exporter and importer to qualify the product, but it is really just a paper control. The truth is that the food supply chain in Asia in particular is fragmented and written data is unreliable. It is impossible to test batches if batch control is not present at the producer end. There are more controls on producing a pair of Nike runners than there is in the processing of food products. An example is some fish labelled as a New Zealand product, which is caught and frozen in New Zealand waters by a foreign vessel, processed and packed in China and then returned to NZ where it is sold to Australia as a NZ product under our open trade agreement without any barriers. I have been told that in many cases the so called NZ fish has been found to be another fish species.Where possible I never purchase processed food product irrespective of the brand because of my belief that our food chain is contaminated with important product which is hidden because our food labelling laws are crap. I never eat even "fresh" fish that I cannot identify as local or meat that is not fresh from a butcher. Even this is not a safeguard as USA pork is sold as fresh product in our supermarket trays. The only way around this is to buy from a local butcher if you can find one. I shudder to think what rubbish will enter Australia when these so called free trade agreements kick in.

27 Feb 2015 4:05:52pmWe have very high food standards but unfortunately these only apply to food grown, processed and packed here. This comes at a price because all those compliance requirements add to the costs. Many other countries do not have comparable standards and their food is cheaper. Labour costs, FTAs etc add to the problems for local growers to compete with overseas producers.Bottom line is our food is really good by world standards, eat stuff from some overseas countries at your peril, exhibit A China. Our current labelling laws do not let us choose easily which is which. Needs fixing.

Compared to the 'in season' price of such things in western Europe, they are several times more expensive in the shops here.  Someones making a killing.  My advice, if you can, grow your own!
