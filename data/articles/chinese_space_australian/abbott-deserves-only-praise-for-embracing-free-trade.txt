The Abbott Government has been criticised for being too eager to sign free trade agreements with Korea, Japan, and China, but Australia will benefit from its resolve, writes Chris Berg.The economics of trade can be a little counter-intuitive.This is no more so than for its central lesson, which is this: the benefits of tariff liberalisation primarily accrue to the countries that lower their own tariffs, not their trading partners.Or, putting it another way, even if we lived in a world where every single country had high barriers to trade and refused to budge them, it would still be in our interest to lower our own.So while the China-Australia free trade agreement (FTA) is a big deal, it's not a big deal for the reasons most reports have suggested.Take the provision in the FTA which phases out Chinese tariffs on Australian dairy for infant formula over a four-year period.The Age is predicting that this formula market will be "enormously lucrative" for Australian businesses. The Australian Dairy Industry Council is chalking the agreement up as a win.But the winners here are really Chinese consumers.Access to quality infant formula is a serious problem in China. In 2008, there was an international scandal when it was discovered the largest budget infant formula firm had been adding industrial chemicals to fake protein content.More than 50,000 children were reported to have become sick from the formula. Four died.Now, understandably, Chinese parents don't want to buy domestically produced formula. The demand for formula imports is so high that Hong Kong and Macau have placed limits on the amount of formula Chinese tourists can bring home with them.So while it might be true that opening up the Chinese formula market will be lucrative for Australian firms, this seems to miss the point. The real winners are surely the Chinese people who have been genuinely suffering from their government's dairy protectionism.A lot of trade discussions are like this - focused on the benefits to firms and workers when it ought to look at how consumers fare.Of course, most people are both workers and consumers, and are interested in both the supply and demand parts of the economic equation.But as Adam Smith wrote, "Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer."Hopefully we all love our jobs, but no doubt what we most love about our jobs is the fact that we get paid to do them, and that money is available to spend on the things we want or need.So a few happy Australian dairy firms is nothing compared to the millions of Chinese families who will benefit from the FTA.It is this producers' bias that has led us to a world where the cause of free trade is being driven by two-party trade agreements.For while it might be easy to demonstrate that - on an academic level - a country will be better off if it lowered its own trade barriers unilaterally, few politicians have the sort of political nous and conceptual clarity to present such a case to the public.Governments have worked out that the politics of trade liberalisation is easier if it is done on a piecemeal and bilateral level - emphasising what it has managed to get other countries.This isn't necessarily a bad thing. Anything that makes beneficial change more politically palatable should be welcomed.But the fact that trade liberalisation benefits the liberaliser first and foremost suggests that the economics of FTAs are very different from the way they are presented.Have a look at the official Australian announcement of the deal. It is completely dominated by reforms China will have to make to allow market access to Australian firms. There is very little mention of what we have to do.The deal involves Australia reducing tariffs on clothes, cars, components and electronics from China. We also will be relaxing our foreign investment guidelines. Tony Abbott said on Monday that some aspects of the deal would require legislation to be passed.Politics being what it is, using self-interested producers eager to open up foreign markets to agitate for the reduction of protectionism at home isn't a bad way to build a political coalition for change.Earlier this year in The Drum, I argued that the bilateral trade negotiation process holds back the cause of domestic reform. It can perversely encourage countries to hold back unilateral changes as a bargaining chip.But here's the thing. The Abbott Government has been criticised for being too eager to sign these agreements. Bill Shorten says that Labor is pro-free trade but thinks the government is "more focused on booking a venue for the signing ceremony than examining the fine print or getting a better deal".Yet if we view FTAs as primarily a tool for shifting domestic policy, then what sort of deal are we holding out to get? Playing the tough negotiator would be counter-productive - harming ourselves by delaying our own reform program. It is in the interest of the Australian economy to conclude these agreements as quickly as practicable.And that's why it is in the realm of free trade agreements that the Coalition has been most clearly successful. For all the Gillard government talked about the 'Asian century', it has been the Abbott Government that has given us free trade agreements with Korea, Japan, and China.Chris Berg is policy director at the Institute of Public Affairs.

18 Nov 2014 7:43:40pmTrue, first off obviously nothing is free and this is not even an agreement but an agreement to keep on talking to try and reach an agreement.And of course it does not mean free trade between the two countries just ask the farming side that missed out. It is a selective trade agreement.It would be interesting to see what would happen if there actually was a free trade agreement, add to this the freedom of labour to move to where the jobs were.
Alert moderator
18 Nov 2014 2:29:02pmUm, that's why they call it negotiation.  Regardless of the semantics the benefits will be measured in the $billions.  Not bad work for a "moron."
Alert moderator
18 Nov 2014 5:08:34pmThe question is "billions" for who? Also, the government constantly claims this will "create jobs" yet we are never told where or how or given any specifics whatsoever. The fact that all of these trade deals were stuck for years and this ideological mob has suddenly passed several in the space of months makes me wonder exactly what has been sacrificed in terms of sovereignty and job conditions and stability. If it is of any benefit to the average person it would be unique in being the first trade agreement to do so.
Alert moderator
18 Nov 2014 6:36:37pmpmgThe billions in benefits are the total of billions in tariffs that consumers will no longer have to pay (and it is ALWAYS consumers who pay tariffs), and the billions in opportunities for our exporters that will open up in China.Does that answer the question?

18 Nov 2014 5:14:36pmWell, pete, the last FTA they signed in 2004 disadvantaged Australia and subsidized the superpower to the tune of $14 billion a year. Not bad - except for Australia.
Alert moderator
18 Nov 2014 6:55:18pmNot according to the ABS.An average $1.2 billion annual increase in merchandise trade between 2005 -2009.US investment in Australia grew from $334 billion in 2005 to $418bn to 2008.  That is an average increase of $20bn a year.And not all trade is commodities.  Crucially, the export of services has grown exponentially since the free trade agreement to the point where the value of services to the US is now worth twice as much as the value of our goods sent to the US.These numbers also ignore the benefits that tens of thousands of Australians have embraced via the E3 working visas available to Australians.  (E3 is one of the most preferential work visas available from the US)  In 2008 alone, 15,000 Australians used E3 visas to work in the US giving them invaluable exposure and experience.The Aus-USA FTA is by no means perfect and was not helped when Kevin Rudd bowed to a small vested interest groupsand kept import restrictions on copyrighted books, but it is nonetheless beneficial to the national interest both directly and indirectly and to tens of thousands of Australians whose career aspirations lie beyond our shores.

18 Nov 2014 7:45:40pmPete this agreement has been in the pipe line for 10 years. It has been worked on by both sides AND more importantly it is NOT yet an agreement.Just an in principle agreement with many points still to be hammered out.Today was just a PR exercise nothing more. Let's actually wait to see what happens.

19 Nov 2014 12:24:45pmNo it won't. China is a very VERY smart player on a huge stage. This mob in government (and yes even labor govts before them) do not have a clue when it comes to this.Why do you think dairy was included, so the Chines can then openly buy dairy farms up the wazzo to guarantee this supply to China....and THEN when milk in Oz shops is back to around $5 for two litres (and most profits going back to Chinese National companies) then folks here will realise just how "good" this FTA is.And dairy is but one small part....

19 Nov 2014 8:51:24amCan't wait to get a job milking all those cows out on the Simpson desert.Dairy farmers have already claimed that their production is already at peak.The greatest impediment to dairy farming in Australia is the lack of and cost of water. Why do you think we import so many dairy products from NZ?
Alert moderator
18 Nov 2014 11:41:39amStill not convincedthe previous trade agreement with the US was touted much the same way. No benefits materialised.This agreement appears to allow China the freedom to buy Australia, in return we get cheaper TV's (as if they weren't cheap enough already!), and lose more manufacturing jobs.The dairy deal will be great for those farmers, but it will mean higher dairy prices for us at home (in the same way that our gas prices will go up as we export ever more gas). Similarly for beef, and other agri exports.
Alert moderator
19 Nov 2014 8:41:52amWe only buy TV's once every 3 years. Mobile phones one overy 2 years (if all of that). As we export the food to China we will have local shortages the same that is going to happen with the gas we are going to export. If that happens the prices will rise and we will not benefit at all unless we buy a tv or a mobile every week.

18 Nov 2014 11:43:18amAll the things people are worried about in relation to the FTA with China (eg. employment, environmental compromise, selling the farm), have any of these played out in New Zealand or is their agreement with China too different to compare?
Alert moderator
18 Nov 2014 2:05:18pmThe Investor State Dispute Settlements (ISDS) component is a worry. ISDS allows foreign investors to sue governments if that government legislates change that negatively impact their investments.For example if in the future we were to legislate to reduce our Coal output we could find those investing in Coal from suing us for multi-billion dollar payouts for any future losses  they have. A cynical person would be forgiven in thinking that this is being done on purpose to put pressure on any future government not to change the regulatory rules, thus protection the Coal investor (read China and/or India). I would suggest this was a major concession from the Abbott government in getting the Memorandum of Understanding with China over the line as it was an impediment during the Gillard years. I am unsure whether this can be changed at this late hour in the negotiations.Is this in our best interest?. I congratulate the government on the MoU with China, but I have huge concerns as I have explained above. Do we really wish for Australia to be held to ransom like this?
Alert moderator
18 Nov 2014 5:15:03pmYes. ISDS sounds like a great thing. Holding Government's financially accountable for stealing people's property rights is long overdue IMO. Everybody should be able to sue their government.The tricky bit is when bad current legislation gives unfair monopoly rents or rights and making sure that undoing such legislation doesn't result in the ISDS being invoked.
Alert moderator
18 Nov 2014 6:01:52pmIf I read you correct Frank then it is okay by you for cigarette companies to sue us because of lost sales due to changes in the Australian law. I understand there are two sides to every story but surely a Country has the right to change direction on policy without having to pay uncontracted compensation to foreign entities. Remember these rules would only apply to FTA partner country companies and not our own. If the government wanted to raise taxes or increase regulation that could lead to foreign companies having being compensated and thus having an advantage over our own.
Alert moderator
18 Nov 2014 6:41:27pmNot sure why the need to pick on smokers and their product suppliers, but absolutely. The cost of smoking related diseases can be determined in the courts independently of the government and such legal and settlement costs are not subject to ISDS.
Alert moderator
18 Nov 2014 7:53:50pmThe tobacco companies took the govt to court over the uncompensated loss of brand value when plain packaging came into play.  Their argument being that the government should pay compensation as they had effectively hijacked their brands.  The high court found in favour of the government.  I believe that was an enormous mistake and sets an incredibly dangerous precedent whereby a government can ruin the value of an asset and escape paying compensation despite the fact that the brand product is legally for sale in every super market, corner store and petrol station in the country with but one restriction.

18 Nov 2014 11:46:16amG'day Chris.Thanks for your article.  Much as I admire Mr Abbott, I believe that international trade, free or otherwise, is not a good idea.  If a country the size of Australia can't find or make all we need for a healthy, happy life, then is it really suitable for human habitation?  I believe it is, but not at the level of population we now have (let alone what we'll have if we continue along the path of Growth-supported-by-Debt).Perpetual growth is not sustainable.  Go forth & stabilise!Regards,Cobber
Alert moderator
18 Nov 2014 4:20:17pmThe madness of Economics pushes us to 'trade' in many instances in which we should (for many reasons) manage for ourselves.This is the case from a personal level to a global level.However, the open supply and exchange (not needing to be balanced in its 'value') of what someone may have more than enough of that some others can use very well is a cornerstone of our potential to be something really fine.We should do this between individuals - 'neighbours' - and we should do it between good societies of people (we should probably even supply what we can well spare to 'bad' societies too, but wisely).Which is to say, I agree with some of what you say but for reasons that might not be your reasons for saying it.And I completely disagree with your principal point about international trade.Oh, and I don't admire Mr Abbott at all.
Alert moderator
18 Nov 2014 11:51:21amWell Chris, let's wait & see what is actually in the small print. These FTA deals are always sold like some used car advert & yet they rarely meet many of the stated benefits.The thing that we need to see is the whole deal not just what the Govt. wants to make public, because there is often a lot of snake oil in the real detail.So until the whole deal is revealed I will remain very sceptical.
Alert moderator
18 Nov 2014 6:23:15pmExactly.    Chris writesBut as Adam Smith wrote, "Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer."His assessment of free trade is on a principle drawn from a long dead economist.A proper assessment requires analysis of the detail and an assessment of the wins and losses. I suspect that the rush to complete the FTAs with Abbott is that the countries know he is easily conned and non too rigorous in his analysis.

18 Nov 2014 11:54:13amFree Trade makes wonderful sense.Economics - in its Political cape - makes no sense at all.We could do things very well, or we could do things Politically and Economically.Somehow, we stay with what is close to the worst way possible.

18 Nov 2014 11:54:58amChris - "benefits of tariff liberalisation primarily accrue to the countries that lower their own tariffs, not their trading partners."Someone should tell our trading partners, China, Korea, Japan - so they will rush out and drop the 300-600% tariffs on ag products including rice.

18 Nov 2014 11:58:15amA balanced post and in most ways I would agree .But why does Abott get all the credit..Surely there were many previous Australian Governments involved over a period of many years.However recently the Minister of Trade and his Department concluded the FTA,s..so in the and for the final push they certainly deserve most of if not all of the credit for completing a very difficult set of negotiations.
Alert moderator
18 Nov 2014 1:34:04pmBecause Abbott is the team captain, and he has the leadership  of a great team that continues to get things done rather than spending 6 years of naval gazing and dysfunction like the last Rudd / Gillard / Rudd debacle. With proven performers like Andrew Robb, Scott Morrison & Julie Bishop, the Abbott Government continues to delivery in spades . Already delivering more in 14 months than the last mob did in 6 years.Just as you have no problem blaming Abbott for everything that might go wrong or anything you don't like about  this government, then perhaps you can also award Abbott for the achievements he delivers. Which are now mounting up weekly .It must be so irksome for many here at the Drum !

In saying that only one of those particular idiots is PM and he has proven to be a total embarrassment. When compared to Abbott, Shorten seems somewhat Einstein like, admittedly from a very very low baseline set by Abbott.

18 Nov 2014 2:36:31pmthe sticking point in this agreement under the Gillard government was the ISDS, which allows foreign corporations to sue our government if policy changes have a negative impact on their investmentsAbbott has basically caved in on this in order to get it over the line and score some political points.These ISDS deals have cost other countries dearly, for example some cigarette manufacturers are suing in South America for more than a billion dollars, and I believe Russia has been successfully sued for 50 billion dollars.I think it is called 'selling the farm'

The other problem is its all done in secret and we are only told whats in it for us while concealing the truth about what we have given away. In this case the free trade agreement with China has not yet had its full implications explored, so offering congratulations is certainly premature. Due to the otherwise overwhelming incompetence of the Abbott government I fear Australia (Andrew Robb) has just sold Australian sovereignty to China. We shall see.

18 Nov 2014 12:15:18pmI think Mr. Berg overstates the Coalition's abilities. Given that these agreements typically take several years (or longer) to initiate, negotiate, draft and conclude I seriously doubt that the L-NP can take all the credit, any more than the ALP could. For L-NP it is fortunate timing, and conversely, the ALP would be basking in the "free trade" afterglow, if by some miracle the ALP had still been government

18 Nov 2014 12:17:06pmChris Berg (IPA) apparently does not know what 'free trade' actually is. This Discriminatory Trade Agreement' (DTA) once again gains concessions for rocks/ crops/ livestock.  However, consistent with the Agrarian Socialist mantra peddled by the mainstream flat-earth economists - it fails to allow free Australian access of advanced industrial goods and manufacturing - once again accelerating de-industrialisation.The DTA's signed in recent years have fragmented and smashed Australian industry into the floor.  They have given access of foreign nations to buy Aussi assets (disallowing reciprocal access to foreign assets), while allowing Australians to buy more consumer goods.  The result: We sell Aussi assets to pay for foreign consumer goods.  Since Wealth = Assets - Liabilities, future Australian generations will be poorer as the Boomers sell the last national assets at knock-down prices to pay for computers, BMWs, TVs and just about every other consumer good of the 21st century.DTA's are an affront to Free Trade.Craig Stevens

18 Nov 2014 12:32:46pmIt is not a matter of being against trade agreements; they are a necessity.  The problem is the spin.FTA (Free Trade Agreement) is a misnomer.I cannot believe Berg is sincere with the milk formula example.  That was an issue of internal regulation and enforcement of standards for China; a criminal matter.  It is about gaining access to the Chinese economy for the financial benefit of the companies the IPA represents.  Hopefully, trade agreements are beneficial to both parties but pretending to be motivated by altruism for the partners in the agreement is laughable."Or, putting it another way, even if we lived in a world where every single country had high barriers to trade and refused to budge them, it would still be in our interest to lower our own."  is extreme nonsense that serves the agenda of large multi nationals at the expense of the sovereignty of individual nations.

You could say getting rid of the Carbon Price and stopping the development of an ETS is getting things done, but at the end of the day, was it good or bad. The mounting evidence suggests that it was a very poor decision indeed and thus bad for Australia. The same can be said about the governments policies associated with their unfair budget. The more they 'get done' the worse off the people are, and that's why half their unfair budget is still sitting on the sidelines. Getting things done is by no means a measure of success. Getting good results for the people of the country, now that's a different matter entirely. Thus far I cannot see much for celebration.

18 Nov 2014 4:31:54pmI doubt it Nose.Commentators seem to emphasise the benefits of the export market which is good for farmers.I am not so sure about imports though. The story here is that the removal of the tariff benefits the consumer, and well it might if the credit card does not get used.However, and I find this increasingly puzzling. How is the Government going to make up for the loss in tariff revenue so it can still operate?So far, we have seen the Abbott Government kill off the carbon tax, and now the import tariff. For a Government that has promised to balance the budget in a couple of years time, it has only one way forward, and that is to increase income tax or GST or other indirect taxes.Real wages have not increased in real terms for many years so relying on increasing jobs may only affect the status quo. So as the cost of living, due to inflation continuing to increase, it seems strange that one would also expect the the GST income from cheaper imported goods would also maybe only maintain status quo.Perhaps the former governments realised this and, rather than sign up, displayed a little more sensitivity about their budget deficits. The Abbott Government seems hell bent on seeing its budget deficit rapidly increasing. Not a good look!

18 Nov 2014 12:48:02pmI'm very sceptical of the purported benefits of deals stitched together by lobbyists and dangled before the eyes of half-witted politicians. The people to whom this country belongs - the citizens, as opposed for dairy farmer organisations - are denied any opportunity for input - except perhaps on the ABC's website.The agreement supposedly lowers the FIRB scrutiny on farmland purchases (now to $15m). But the Chinese can still pick up vast swathes of prime farmland without any scrutiny, and they don't even have to pay land tax! They withhold land from our citizens, deplete its soils of fertility, use our roads, rail and ports and don't contribute a penny. I reckon Abbott and his cohorts are traitors to Team Australia.

18 Nov 2014 4:33:56pmActually, the dairy farmers and their lobby own far more of the land than you do?Australians don't own Australia, they own bits of it. At best I suppose you could ssay that all Australians have an equitable interest in Australian society, but nnot in the economy as such.

All subject to FTAs with Japan and South Korea. We shall be flooded with stuff we do not rally need to buy with money we do not have- more debt on households whose debt is 158% of disposable income.  'We will also be reducing our foreign  investment guidelines" .

Well the Chinese are very quick learners- who long will it be before the pupils become the masters? A friend who runs an accounting/audit/tax firm is having much of his work done in the Philippines- paying Philippine wages but charging Aussie fees.So how long will it be before our services industries-which according  to Robb is 80% of our economy goes the same way as our manufacturing?We may have a few happy -(Chinese owned dairy and other firms) but many more unhappy punters.

18 Nov 2014 6:34:00pmFor a couple of highfalutin lawyers you both have no idea do you. Whilst wages are comparatively high in Australia they are not the major cost to manufacturing you right wingers like to make out. I would explain it to you but you simply would not believe me because of your anti Union bias. Please do some research as to the difference in manufacturing costs in Australia and other manufacturing countries like Germany whose wages are higher that ours. Educate yourselves then comment instead of flapping your gums without knowing anything of which you are talking about. For example Rent, value of Aussie dollar, land value, local government taxes and Government support are way more onerous in Australia than other countries.

18 Nov 2014 5:36:41pmI think , in the rush to appear sophisitcated, you misunderstand the argument.In Germany the wokers are well paid because German industry justifies that level of pay, whereas in Australia the high pay came before the industry could justify it.  In a country with fewer customers and distant from the big populations wage sensitivities are always going to be more important than in a country with a strong tradition of manufacturing a huge market on its doorstep and an international reputation for quality.It is true that there has been too little investment in technology and poor management in much of Australian manufacturing in the past. That is because such industry was built on the flase foundation of government subsidy and/or tarrif protection.  This meant that the managers and the unions could afford to be slack.
Alert moderator
18 Nov 2014 2:40:50pmWe could not have a manufacturing industry unless we were producing top quality produce and then wages wouldn't matter.Unfortunately our banks are loathe to lend for that type of enterprise preferring home loans.

We would also need a command economy.The CCP and families as well as those favoured few millions will buy our dairy, seafood, meat and assets.

18 Nov 2014 7:49:42pmThe lower wages argument is a fallacy Rae. The reasons are complex and varied but by far the high Aussie dollar is the most onerous aspect of our economy when it comes to manufacturing. Our dollar has been artificially high due to the Mining sector investment boom that has just started to wane. This coupled with the fact that the Chinese Yuan is kept artificially low by their government and accounts for the majority of cost of labour difference.. The question is did Abbott and Co. broach this subject with the Chinese officials at the G20 and hold them to account for their currency manipulation. The answer is NO. Gutless.

18 Nov 2014 1:23:48pmFTA agreements sometimes bring prosperity, sometimes they don't. It depends. Example: Country A produces raw materials. Country B produces manufactured goods and cheap labour. Country B absolutely must have raw materials. Country A does not absolutely require the goods and cheap labour. So, an FTA will benefit Country B more than Country A because they now easier to access Country A's broader market and can therefore expand their exports. Whereas no real benefit has been gained by Country A by accessing more of Country B"s market - they already require the raw materials and will buy them anyways at the international market price. So, we need to see the detail. We need to see what we have really gained from this arrangement. Nothing is ever "free". Did we get a good deal? That is what we need to assess.

18 Nov 2014 1:52:50pmMr Chris Berg seems to be very long winded in praising the benefits of FTA with China without being interested in considering COSTS to many ordinary Australians of such a deal.Like Abbott and his dark host of neoliberal converts, Chris talks about REFORM and "shifts in domestic policy" as if these terms imply WIN-WIN situation for all, as if REFORM means a CHANGE for the BETTER in our society. Unfortunately, as ACTU President Ms Kearney said:"Unions are deeply concerned about the inclusion of an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism (ISDS)". This puts the Australian national sovereignty under risk! Since foreign companies can sue the governments, if they think they are being harmed by government regulation, and thus indirectly force higher taxes on to the taxpayer. ?Companies should not be given so much power over national laws and politics. Our Government must be able to take political decisions without being afraid of a multi-national company taking them to court.?The ACTU is also very much concerned  "that Australians will pay a very high price for this deal through higher unemployment as Chinese workers are brought in for jobs on infrastructure and resource projects, while our already struggling manufacturing industry will be devastated further" Ms Kearney said.

That's what the USA have done since Reagan, end result: US$ 250 Billion deficit against the Americans in their trade with China for 2014 (until September)! The deficit was US$ 318 Billion in 2013!!!.... So, the above statement from the article is total crap!... Or, putting it another way, it is strongly recommended NOT to go into battle with your pants down....

18 Nov 2014 3:37:38pm"The real winners are surely the Chinese people who have been genuinely suffering from their government's dairy protectionism".... The real winners are the Chinese people indeed, as they are buying into our dairy farms!!! So, in the end it will be Chinese investors exporting to Chinese people via Australian-based farms.... Smart, isn't it?What about Australian-owned dairy farms?... Oh, don't worry, under this Neoliberal regime, surely something will trickle down.

18 Nov 2014 5:35:26pmThey will be exporting the Chinese workers too -- because according to terms of the FTA Chinese investors can bring their own materials, equipment and workers if they want to. Read the comments by the ACTU president.With the Chinese workers coming in here, in their thousands upon thousands, replacing Australian workers, further dynamics and pressures on Australian workers will be put in place.Nice future for our kids!

18 Nov 2014 7:57:29pmI should not be disappointed that you took the negative angle of the FTA being a bad deal Alpo. The whole ALP machine is the most negative wrecking ball opposition in the history of Australia.Why didn't you take the positive angle of it is a great deal thanks to the last ALP Govt who worked on it for 6 years?You should have waited for Bill and Penny to provide the script because you may have to do 180 degree turn. But I am sure you will be able to spin your way out of that.

19 Nov 2014 7:41:26am"whole ALP machine is the most negative wrecking ball opposition in the history of Australia"... No, that was the Abbott led Opposition... but it looks like it did work for him in the end........ We are fast learners, Esteban.... enjoy the taste of Abbott's own poisoned chalice. After he is gone and replaced with the Shorten led ALP Government, I invite everybody to be more positive and constructive.... will you come on board, Esteban?

19 Nov 2014 12:19:04pmA good ALP Government is just as good as a good coalition Government.I was certainly on board during the Hawke/Keating era.I was not on board in the Rudd eras. I was prepared to get on board during the Gillard era but the CT and treasurer put paid to that.I don't care who leads the ALP. If they have a good funded policy platform, take it to the people and implement it in an orderly fashion I will be on board.Unlike your promise to wait 6 months before being negative about the FTA,  you can take my word to the bank.

18 Nov 2014 4:54:32pmFinally, a commentator is giving credit where credit is due.The Abbott government, in a little over 12 months, has delivered the nation 3 major trade agreements, where Labor could only produce talk fest after talk fest and open ended promises.On top of that, the largest democracy in the world, India, has committed to sign an Australia-India FTA within 12 months.If the Lefty's on this site still believe that Australia isn't open for business, think again.  Come on, guys, there's still time to join Team Australia.

18 Nov 2014 6:51:25pmI have a couple of concerns about free trade.Once we have large industries and a high number of jobs relying on foreign countries, does our government become open to manipulation, under the threat of economic pressure being applied by the more powerful economy? For example the pressure the west (rightly or wrongly) is putting on Russia.Our environment is under huge pressure now, let alone if it was further stressed by trying to feed as many Indian and Chinese mouths as possible. That's well over two billion people. We don't have the available water, we have poor soils already and animals are going to be under further threat of extinction. The author might think Abbott deserves only praise for this FTA. I would argue this sort of short term greed will lead to a massive problem for future generations to clean up, and should be utterly condemned.

19 Nov 2014 1:04:11pmDon't forget the fact that when the big Australian farming, starts feeding 2 billion Chinese and Indians, the price of food in Australia is not likely to drop -- or remain the same.The Australian meat, dairy, and food producers will start charging domestic consumers the world prices for their food. There won't be surplus stocks of food left in Australian supermarkets to be cleared at cheapest bargain prices.The products of Australian land, the products of its labour and technology, will NEVER AGAIN be distributed at the cheapest price possible to Australian consumers. The last vestige o responsibility of the big business and big farming, to take FIRST CARE of the nation whose resources it is selling for profit will be gone!

18 Nov 2014 6:57:31pmI thought this was supposed to be the impartial and honest ABC not some Newscorp Liberal support piece. If this "free" trade deal was in Australia's best interest do you really think China would sign it? That's China the biggest exporter of almost everything in the world.

18 Nov 2014 7:51:37pmBeing for or against the China - Australia FTA before the real details are revealed is not a particularly sound position for either side of the debate to take. It is to be hoped that the Chinese did not smell blood in the water before the deal was signed and then moved in for the kill. My experience is that if you sell your house by telling prospective buyers that the deal has to be done by a certain time on a certain day the price has every chance of being way below market value.Many good judges question the deals struck by Australia with the USA and Korea to mention just two. The China deal was ten years in the making and then the current government advertised to anybody who would listen that signatures on the document were ideally to coincide with the G20 summit in Brisbane. We are also racing headlong into a deal with India. Wishing no disrespect to either of these countries, but is Australia currently on a cargo cult of FTAs.I guess time alone will tell, but the Australian Government has not only the job of improving the trading position of this country but also that of ensuring that employment prospects of its young people are protected down the track. Whichever way you look at it exporting minerals, energy and some agricultural products is not going to improve the employment prospects of all that many Australians.  China has a rapidly expanding professional and technologically savvy workforce.  It is not unreasonable that Chinese investors establishing businesses would want to introduce some of these people if suitably qualified Australians are not available to fill the gaps.Unfortunately recent experience with 457 visa holders would suggest that training Australians may not be an attractive proposition if people to fill such vacancies can readily be recruited from China.  We are already being softened up to accept the possible legal imposts of the TPP. Being hit by the provisions of employment unfriendly agreements is definitely a reasonable source of disquiet for those who are trying to look past the hype to the true consequences of the agreements currently being concluded and those in prospect.

19 Nov 2014 9:46:21amI wonder how much the destruction of the TAFE system was a planned part of this or if it was just stupid decision making.It is pretty hard to run an effective training system when the key operators are in it for the hundreds of millions they can get individually.

19 Nov 2014 2:14:32amFree Trade is a good aspiration, but only when there is also reciprocal currency, tax law and social security policy between the parties involved. This lack of reciprocity lies at the heart of EU problems with Greece et al; jobs are exported to cheaper producers, but the social security responsibilities remain with the country that lost the jobs, and with a smaller tax revenue to boot as a result. The USA, in a similar bind having exported jobs to China, neatly solved this problem by effectively telling the dispossessed American workers to go die in a ditch.Unless FTA is implemented with true social reciprocity, the small will always lose out to the large, and the egalitarian will always lose to the greedy. There is little to see that Australia has achieved true reciprocity with either the USA nor China. We have been sold out to the highest bidder and the Liberal party should hang its head in shame. Shame on you for acting against the National Interest!Intellectual Property law became a legal goldmine and unworkable minefield with the advent of the USA/Australia FTA. I hate to think how this new agreement has lumped together yet more incompatible laws.

19 Nov 2014 4:34:04amYes, yes, yes, but praise for what?  For making Australia an international sacrificial lamb?  If Tony Abbott is really into that sacrificial stuff may I suggest he goes about it by moving to China himself.  Some of us really wish not to be dragged into to sacrificial pot, especially when we are being sacrificed for the love of money and the love of money alone.

19 Nov 2014 6:07:50amLike many conservatives, Chris Berg can only see in black and white. "Free trade is good, therefore any and all free trade is good."It all depends...If the price of getting some extra business from China is to cowtow to their self-righteous expansionist policies, plundering every slightly exposed rock in the South China Sea regardless of who really owns them, or allowing them unbridled access to our valuable farmland in an asymmetrical arrangement that doesn't also allow us to invest in their land, then I say it is a bad deal. We are better off without it.This is nothing more than a cheap political fix for Tony Abbott, who isn't a real Australian, but an imported Pom, who still considers Australia a colonly of .... just about anyone.For too long the conservative side of politics have had far too little respect for their own country, considering it to be simply a satellite colony of some other country. First it was Britain to whom we bowed down and acted as their market garden. Then it was the USA and afterwards, we allowed Japan unfettered access to our minerals and coal at bargain basement prices.Now it seems that when China says "Jump", Abbot simply asks "How high".China has the history of simply marching over the top of any country that it wishes to, such as Tibet in 1959. In this regard they have a lot in common with Nazi Germany who thought it their "right" to expand Germany by taking over neighbouring countries like Czechoslovakia, Poland, Austria etc., with no respect for the law.The Chinese president stated this week that China wanted peace, like the "big guy in the room" but of course this means only on their terms. They have no respect for the views or claims of any other country who happen to have a different view.Just ask the Dalai Lama.

19 Nov 2014 7:51:30amChris. Three years ago the Leader of the Opposition was one of those critics. As the Gillard Govt did a lot more than talk about FTAs, Tony Abbott sniped at them. He complained that China is not a 'market economy' and he would not be pursuing any agreements with them. But now, he's the biggest fan - and all he had to do was sign the document. As always someone else did the heavy lifting for him and he turns up to take a bow.

19 Nov 2014 9:17:42amOnly one problem with your line of argument Chris.  The Abbott administration are signing FTA's that include provisions John Howard's , Kevin Rudd's, and Julia Gillard's administrations deemed to be against Australia's national interest.  All three administrations refused to allow ISDS provisions to be included in trade agreements.There well, of course, be economic benefits reaped by many in the Australian economy.  Those benefits will, however, be negated by a single detrimental ruling in an ISDS claim.A government that signs three FTA's that include ISDS, and continues to negotiate the TPP, which contains it also, is not acting in our national interest.  Just like our failure to act on global warming, our children and grandchildren will rue the day we were foolish enough to sign away our sovereign rights to an unelected body of quasi-jurists.And Australia's conservatives bang on about Australia being ruled by 'faceless men' when the other mob are in power, HUH?
