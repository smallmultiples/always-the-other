A landmark air services agreement between the Australian and Chinese governments will open the way for new routes.The cap on seats from China's largest cities to the Australian gateway cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth will triple to almost 67,000 seats each week by 2016.Routes to smaller cities, like Adelaide and Cairns, will have no limits.China is Australia's most valuable tourism market, with almost 800,000 visitors spending up to $5 billion in the country last year.It is also set to overtake New Zealand as the biggest inbound market by next year.Tourism Australia managing director John O'Sullivan said the deal would lead to improved service capacity to major gateway cities."It will provide more flexibility and more opportunities for passengers," Mr O'Sullivan said.Four state-owned Chinese airlines already fly to Australia and now airports are hoping to attract second-tier airlines from big regional centres.Qantas is the only Australian carrier that flies to China and is waiting on regulatory approval for a joint venture with China Eastern.In a statement, Qantas said the increased capacity supports the goals of its proposed joint venture "which includes the exploration of opening up new routes between Australia and mainland China, such as Brisbane and Perth to Shanghai".Aviation analyst Peter Harbison said route economics were currently weak."That is, it is a very price-sensitive and seasonal market. And there is a lot of intermediate capacity, e.g. via Singapore, Bangkok, which also allows dispersion to a range of cities," he said.Melbourne Airport CEO Chris Woodruff welcomed the agreement, after traffic from China increased by 20 per cent last year."We had an airline, China Eastern, wanting to add more flights, but we were unable to do so because the flight cap had been reached," Mr Woodruff said."What today's announcement does is remove that risk for the next two or three years."Sydney Airport has also seen increased numbers of visitors from China by 16 per cent.
