A man has been found guilty of murdering Sydney sex worker Ting Fang in an Adelaide hotel room by beating her with a stiletto and slitting her throat with a razor.The body of Ms Fang, 25, was found in the Hotel Grand Chancellor on Hindley Street early on New Year's Day last year.Water had flooded from her room into a corridor and a room on the floor below.After five hours of deliberation, a South Australian Supreme Court jury unanimously found Chinese national Chungaung Piao, 28, guilty of Ms Fang's murder.Piao showed no emotion as the verdict was handed down in court.During the trial, the court heard Piao was Ms Fang's last client and was seen on security footage leaving the hotel about 12:30am.It heard a razor blade used in the murder that was found at the scene matched blades found in Piao's work van.The defence counsel had argued that phone records, which were missed in the initial investigation, revealed Ms Fang's phone travelled between the city and suburban Netley some time after 2:00am.Defence lawyer Greg Mead said the records indicated Ms Fang was still alive when Piao left the hotel and the evidence highlighted inconsistencies in the prosecution's case. "If in the prosecution evidence there is a significant unexplained event - such as the movement and return of the phone at a time when, on their case, the deceased is already dead - you are entitled to conclude that the prosecution have not proved their case, that there is reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of this killing," he said.But prosecutor Tim Preston said the phone records were erroneous and described the defence council's theory as "absurd"."All other evidence points overwhelmingly and totally in the direction of the phone not leaving the hotel room of the Hotel Grand Chancellor," he said."[Somehow] the deceased has left the hotel room, made her way to Netley without appearing on any CCTV footage and teleported herself back inside the hotel room by 8:19am without triggering the door lock log."Piao was remanded in custody to be sentenced at a later date, with sentencing submissions to be heard in August.
