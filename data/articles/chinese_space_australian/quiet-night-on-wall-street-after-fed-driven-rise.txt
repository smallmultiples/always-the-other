Wall Street took a breather overnight as traders had little else to mull over other than the previous day's US Federal Reserve communication. After setting a new intra-day high in the morning, the Dow Jones closed just 15 points higher, or 0.1 per cent, at 18,225.The S&P 500 closed down 2 points (0.1 per cent) at 2,114. Volume was around half the daily average, with traders pausing ahead of a data dump tonight, Australian time, which includes US inflation and durable goods orders as well as eurozone sentiment surveys and German unemployment. Most investors have welcomed yesterday's comments from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, which they believe suggest the US central bank is in no rush to raise interest rates.Also supporting trade was some upbeat official housing data, which showed new home sales remained near multi-year highs in January despite the wild snow storms that gripped much of the US. Slightly better than expected Chinese factory activity data did little to spur trade. HSBC's monthly report on conditions revealed that Chinese factory activity expanded in February, ending two consecutive months of contraction. Across the Atlantic, European markets also took a breather after setting multiple new records this week.London's FTSE 100 retreated 0.2 per cent to 6,935, while other major indices in the region gave back between 0.1 and 0.2 per cent. Australian stocks were set to follow global counterparts lower at the start of trade; at 8.15am (AEDT) the ASX SPI 200 was 0.3 per cent lower at 5,903.Commodities were supported overnight; crude oil bounced 2.4 per cent and most metals rose, except iron ore. West Texas Crude closed up at $US50.15 a barrel, despite reports that US crude inventories are higher than expected. Spot gold was also higher at $US1,205.14 an ounce. The cautious rates outlook from the Federal Reserve has taken the wind out of the US dollar and boosted the Aussie, also helped by the Chinese manufacturing data.
