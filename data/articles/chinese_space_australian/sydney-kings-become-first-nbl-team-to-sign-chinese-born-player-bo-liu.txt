The Sydney Kings have become the first NBL team to sign a Chinese-born player.Bo Liu, from China's CBA team the Shenzen Leopards, will join the Kings for the 2016-17 season on contract as a development player."The Sydney Kings welcome Bo Liu to our organisation," managing director Jeff Van Groningen said."Working with the Shenzen Leopards has been fantastic â€” basketball provides a unifying force between organisations and indeed nations."The Kings have taken advantage of an NBL rule change that will allow teams to sign a player from the FIBA Asian Zone and not lose one of its three import spots on the roster."I think it's a great initiative, we're trying to integrate our leagues and have international competitions and all those things have long-term benefits," Sydney Kings coach Andrew Gaze said.The NBL's rule change is set to open the door for more Chinese players to enter the league. And the Kings are not the only ones likely to take up the advantage.The ABC understands other teams also want to try to sign a Chinese player for this season. "It's something the league is trying to encourage," Mr Gaze said."I think it can strengthen the NBL in a number of ways: one is talent, the opportunity to bring in new talent, but also to tap into the resources that China has."The King's coach has spent time with the 207cm-tall Bo Liu over the last six months."He's a high-energy guy, runs the floor really well and is super aggressive on the defensive end," he said."He played for my good mate Brian Goorjian in China, and for a guy who doesn't speak much English he picks things up really fast."He is a genuinely funny guy even though his English is a work in progress."Liu said he was looking forward to working with the former Boomer. "[He's an] icon of Australia, I was really happy that I was the one selected to come to Australia to play for him," he said."I like Andrew's style a lot because on court he's really serious."He gets very angry and furious and demonstrative, telling us what to do."He's very strict. But off court he makes funny jokes, talks about everything."And he jokes around with me."That type of personality is something different to the type of coaches I've so far had in China."
