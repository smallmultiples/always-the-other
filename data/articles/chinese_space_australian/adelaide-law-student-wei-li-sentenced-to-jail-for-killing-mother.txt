An Adelaide law student who killed his mother and claimed it to be self defence after allegedly suffering years of physical and emotional abuse has been sentenced to nine years in jail. Wei Li killed his 41-year-old mother Emma Mei Tian at the family's Burnside home in Adelaide's affluent eastern suburbs in 2011.He claimed at trial that he had acted in self defence and had suffered abuse at the hands of his mother after the family moved from China to Adelaide.Li said his mother yelled and screamed because he did not want to do piano practice and that she had something in her hand.A Supreme Court jury acquitted him of murder but found him guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter.The court heard during the trial his mother suffered more than 50 injuries when she was attacked with a metal pole and strangled.Her body was found days later wrapped in blood-soaked bed sheets in the living room of the family home.After his mother's death, Li went to China via Melbourne and Singapore and remained overseas for three years before being detained by Chinese authorities in 2014 because his visa expired.Justice Trish Kelly said she rejected Li's claims he acted in self defence and would instead sentence him for manslaughter on the basis of provocation.Much of your evidence at trial was untruthful. "Instead of facing up to your responsibility for the killing of your mother in circumstances where you lost your self-control, you have instead repeated to all and sundry again and again the same lie, namely that your mother attacked you with a metal bar and you, not her, were the one engaged in a struggle for your life," she said."Repeating a lie, Mr Li, no matter how often does not make it true."Even taking into account cultural differences between Australian and Chinese people, your behaviour and your conduct in the days, weeks and years after killing your mother demonstrate a chilling lack of remorse or contrition."She accepted his mother had been controlling and abusive but not to the extent Li had claimed and said that did not justify her violent death."Your mother, I do accept was controlling and put a lot of pressure on you regarding your academic and musical studies," she said."I have no doubt the killing of your mother occurred in the context of extreme emotional intensity."I conclude that you are indeed a highly intelligent but narcissistic and self-absorbed young man prepared to lie if you think that it might advance your cause."Much of your evidence at trial was untruthful."Justice Kelly said it was important to acknowledge the dignity and life of the "late and mostly unlamented" Emma Mei Tian.She set a non-parole period of seven years, two months and 11 days.Li's lawyer said he believed the sentence was harsh and his legal team would likely be lodging an appeal against the nine-year jail term.
