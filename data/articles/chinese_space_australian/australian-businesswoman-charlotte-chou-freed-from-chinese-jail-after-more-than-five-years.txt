Australian businesswoman Charlotte Chou has walked free from a Chinese jail after more than five years behind bars.Chou emerged from a detention centre in Guangzhou yesterday.Fairfax newspapers showed photographs of her being greeted by several family members who flew in from Sydney.Chou had been serving an eight-year jail term for embezzlement from a private university she co-founded in Guangzhou, but had her sentence reduced last year.While upholding her guilty verdict, the appeal judge found that the amount Chou was said to have embezzled was $260,000, rather than the $5.9 million originally claimed.She was expected to return to Sydney where she will be reunited with her youngest son Lincoln for the first time since her arrest.
