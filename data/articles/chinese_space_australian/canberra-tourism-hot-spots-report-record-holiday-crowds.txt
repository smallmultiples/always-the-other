Canberra museums and galleries are reporting record numbers of visitors over the summer holidays.Questacon has seen 15,000 visitors through its doors over the Christmas and new year period."We normally get 11,000 visitors over this period and we really put this against Spiders, our new exhibition that came in in November," centre and tourism engagement manager Craig Whelan said.He said the spike in visitors was also due to the low Australian dollar leading more people to holiday close to home.The centre had 2,800 visitors each day on December 28, 29 and 30."We would normally see in this period 2,200 people, so it's 600 more each day," Mr Whelan said."It's been fantastic."The Australian War Memorial's visitor services manager, Gerard Pratt, also said visitor numbers for last week were up by almost 4,500 compared to the same time last year.He said it topped off a busy year for the site, with nearly 1.2 million people coming to the War Memorial in 2015. "I think since the centenary of the Gallipoli landings, we marked those back in April last year, and I think since then visitors in general have wanted to reconnect with that part of our history," Mr Pratt said."But to not only just commemorate that, to commemorate right up to our more recent conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq."The National Library of Australia's Celestial Empire exhibition has been booked out since opening at the weekend."This is traditionally a busy time of year - people are on the road, families are visiting Canberra," director of exhibitions Guy Hansen said."So it's not a surprise that we're busy."But this is busier than usual."Mr Hansen said many of the visitors came from China."This exhibition deals with the history of the Qing Dynasty in China and it's of great interest to Chinese Australians and also Chinese tourists," he said.
