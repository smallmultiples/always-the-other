Works by 15 of China's leading contemporary artists are on display in Hobart in the first stop of an eastern seaboard tour, brought here as part of Lunar New Year celebrations.Zao Hua opened at Salamanca Art Centre's Long Gallery on Wednesday night.Zao Hua is an ancient Chinese term for nature — the theme of the contemporary artworks."It's intended to have the kind of characteristics of Chinese art," Chen Ping, a Tasmanian Chinese artist, told Helen Shield on 936 ABC Hobart."If you look at the exhibition, a lot of the artwork is in one way or another using Chinese traditional art forms but with contemporary thinking." Chen said he worked closely with the city council to bring the exhibition to Hobart for the start of its Australian tour."It's the first of such a major Chinese exhibition in Hobart," he said."We have experienced some other individual artists involved in other exhibitions and events such as MONA, but to have such a big-scale and professionally curated [exhibition] — it's the first time."The exhibition was curated by Professor Zhao Li and Chen Lin from Beijing's Central Academy of Fine Art.It is the second exhibition Professor Zhao has brought to Australia, but the first with showings in Hobart and Melbourne.Chen said the exhibition was an important event to build stronger connections between Tasmanian and Chinese artists."This project is another major step towards establishing ongoing creative exchange between China and Tasmania," he said.Zao Hua is on in the Long Gallery at Salamanca Arts Centre until February 24 before travelling to Melbourne and Sydney.
