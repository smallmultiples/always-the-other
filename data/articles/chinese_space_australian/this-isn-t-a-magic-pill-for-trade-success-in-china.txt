How should Australian companies enter the Chinese market, choose strategic partnerships, and understand and mitigate risk? Those questions haven't disappeared following the free trade deal, writes Kerry Brown.The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) signed yesterday during President Xi Jinping's visit to Australia is a great outcome for Australians, happening in the right way, at the right time, and for the right reasons.In terms of symbolism, it energises the bilateral trade relationship at a time when it was in danger of slipping into complacent reliance on resources and nothing else. It also prompts some deeper thinking about what can be done to have a more diverse, dynamic relationship with our largest trading partner, and one that is more sustainable, more creative, and, in the words of Mr Xi, more imaginative and visionary.Talk of winners and losers however is definitely something to be avoided. A good FTA should lead to equal benefits, and not be regarded as a zero-sum game where one side wants to dominate the other.So while the agricultural sector in Australia can definitely look to the reduction in tariffs for many products over the coming few years, and the services sector can see the opening up of other sectors like insurance and tourism as offering big opportunities, crowing about how this can be a score chalked up to Team Australia where we dished the Chinese is idle. The more sensible view would be to see the FTA opening up spaces that the Chinese see as ones where Australian partnership would be beneficial to them and where they want us to become more active.In that context, the signing of the FTA is in fact the end of the first phase of engagement, and the start of the real work. Everyone now has a much clearer idea of where the best opportunities lie. That has at least cleared up some of the confusion and made the scope for strategic choices a little more narrow.But the issue of how to take up these opportunities is still a big one. In what ways do Australia's companies in the services sector now enter the Chinese market, where do they choose strategic partnerships, what is their time line for business development, and how do they understand and mitigate risk?The bilateral Australia-China FTA has not magically made these questions disappear, nor has it made our largest trading partner an easier place to do business in by clearing away its cultural, political and social differences. It has just identified a path we can take to reach this market better. Succeeding in China is no more a given now than it was before the FTA was signed.The worst outcome of the FTA would be to make Australian businesses not less but more complacent. Reports on the taking up of direct invoicing in Chinese currency after a currency swap deal was agreed in 2013 showed that many local companies were either unaware of the benefits of using an intermediary currency like the US dollar, or simply had not bothered to try the new facility out.It would be a pity if the best-placed companies in the services, agricultural and finance sector, now that they know they have secured a positive place in the FTA, don't proactively take these up. But the FTA alone will not help much. They will need the same strategic insights, the same risk assessments, and the same competitive toughness as they ever did.Across the FTA should be written one very clear, unequivocal warning: China is as tough a place now to succeed and make money as it ever was, and this is as true for Chinese companies as for foreigners. It is a big market, and one we have at least a better route into now, so engagement is good and the FTA helps with that.But the hard slog of going along that route is still the same. An FTA should be a wake up call - not something to lull us to sleep!Professor Kerry Brown is executive director of the China Studies Centre and Professor of Chinese Politics at the University of Sydney.

18 Nov 2014 5:17:34pm"...the signing of the FTA is in fact the end of the first phase of engagement, and the start of the real work"Absolutely correct. Makes you wonder where the billions of dollars already booked against the signing have actually come from then, doesn't it?Personally, I see it as being (from the Australian side) as pointless a thing as all the others that have gone before it. The idea that businesses here that already have a well-established series of mantras ("high labour costs", "crippling taxation", "strangled by red tape", "the tyranny of distance", "exorbitant energy costs", "interfering government", blah, blah, etc.) in place to explain their incompetence are going to risk that sort of a safety net by abandoning it and subsequently being found out is ridiculous.Besides, "red tape" and China go together like Google and tax evasion - if you had a problem with crimson bunting, that hardly seems the logical place to voice your concerns.

19 Nov 2014 7:57:25amWhat high labour costs? As economies grow so do living standards and so does income. Do you think the chinese have problems paying their electricity bills? Do you think there is high unemployment? The chinese are moving into the next century and are hungry for technology and development unlike what is happening here. Australia enjoys a Trade deficit with just about every nation except for China and India and this will change as the only thing we export is what we dig out of the ground.

19 Nov 2014 2:21:08pmYou may wish to re-direct your question to the people that I was paraphrasing. What you've offered up does appear to be an awful lot of output somewhat badly targeted.

18 Nov 2014 6:05:35pmChina is a socialist state. Private property is only allowed to the extent the government finds convenient.If the time ever came to pass when foreign companies started to leave China for a country with cheaper labour, I have no doubt that the Chinese would pass a law "nationalising" private companies and seizing their assets.As far as global economics is concerned, China is a cheat. They only follow other people's rules when it suits them. This is simply a risk that foreign companies need to account for.

18 Nov 2014 6:51:55pmIt's a pity they can't also find a few extra bowlfuls to feed their 24 million starving ideological and strategic mates just over the border in North Korea then.Free trade obviously comes a bit easier to this crowd than free compassion does. Good to see an Australian Prime Minister obsessed with people dying at sea is so relaxed about people dying on land when he's running around with a pen in his hand.

18 Nov 2014 7:49:32pmSeeing as the question that was posed by the article; "...has China finally had enough?" was posed on March 14, 2013, I'd guess it's pretty safe to assume the answer is "No".Another CNN triumph.

19 Nov 2014 8:28:23amI am passionately opposed to repressive government and human rights abuses. I detest the lame justifications and compromises offered for abuses. The abuses of powerful Chinese are justified and a reasonable compromise. I detest the rich and powerful claiming credit for the achievements of the many. Rich and powerful Chinese are feeding 1.4  billion Chinese.I detest imperialism and colonialism.  I look forward to the day Australians are humiliated by growing Chinese power.

19 Nov 2014 3:32:20pmThere is a reason why I mentioned it. You don't seem to understand the consequences of not feeding 1.4 billion people every day. Do you (and other people here), after reading my comments, assume that I'm in love with the Chinese & Russian system? .. and this is the reason why you are responding to me with such words as "repressive government" and "human rights abuses" and so on. For your information, I detest people who consider themselves as the-middle-of-the-road go-getters. They are the real compromisers. The whole world economic system sucks. In this world of The Master & The Slave, there is no middle road.

18 Nov 2014 7:01:42pmI learned recently why lawyers in China are not particularly well-paid. It's because the Govt and well-connected folk make up the law as they need. Who needs a lawyer when a phone call will do? Do business in China - it is fun and a breath of fresh air- but have a system of progress payments, and don't budge an inch on 'em. No pay no delivery.

19 Nov 2014 12:22:50pmHaving no progress payments is naive. We never did anything in Germany without progress payments: 1/3 with order, 1/3 with considerable progress, 1/3 on completion. Invoices were also due after 28 days, when interest would apply if you did not pay. You could do a lot on trust in Australia decades ago, but that time is gone and in the international arena you can't be slack, naive or apply old methods.Just read yesterday, that 2.5 million children in the US are homeless (of, I think, 313 million inhabitants). What are the figures in China?

18 Nov 2014 7:32:03pmWhy hasn't Barnaby Joyce criticised the part of the FTA with China that allows over a billion dollars to be spent purchasing farmland and businesses in Australia without Foreign Investment Review Board scrutiny ?That and the allowance of running of these investments with Chinese workers should have Barnaby worried surely ?I envisage the Australian farmer complaining that he can't compete with the Chinese owned and worked farm next door because he hasn't the contacts in China which it's management has.I find it hard to believe that the Chinese owned farm Chinese labourers will be contributing much to Australia by way of GST, somehow I doubt they will be out buying fancy wheels for transport they have purchased and intend to drive around in Australia ?There could be some benefits to Australia investing in China's aged-care because one child policy has mean that a married couple has both the parents and inlaws to support and there is no other siblings to help with this support. In their culture all the children pitched in to support their parent in old age which gets expensive when all the children is a total of one. The deals been done lets hope there are no problems involving ISDS when trying to restricting water use when places like Adelaide have fresh water problems ?Can anyone inform if ISDS can be used to get compensation for loss of profits by Australian companies operating in China ?

19 Nov 2014 10:51:04amThe real deal is not the removal of trade barriers but to the sell off of Australian farm land and the replacement of Australian workers. One can expect that the current government would grant those Chinese works citizenship allowing even more Chinese nationals in

19 Nov 2014 11:59:14amI didn't like it when Andrew Robb said of the new deal with China that now medical companies can go in there and make a profit, presumably out of sick people.  This government is really push the private health care agenda, probably so that their mates in the private health care industry can make a fortune.  I find this despicable, both in this country and for any other.  I hope China keeps an eye on these types of business.  Health care, as with education, social security management, etc, etc, should not be 'an industry' where private individuals make money at the expense of vulnerable people.I really don't know which system I dislike the most, communism, where individuals don't have enough human rights, or rampant capitalism, where greedy individuals are unscrupulous enough to enjoy making money out of vulnerable people.
