Despite the apparent optimism about the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement and its benefits for Australia, it is clear that changes to migration rules and our industrial sector could come back to haunt us, writes Geoff Wade, in part one of his analysis of the deal.At his meeting with Malcolm Turnbull in Kuala Lumpur last week, Chinese premier Li Keqiang urged that the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA) be rapidly implemented before the end of the year. He also called on Australia to collaborate with China in "production capacity cooperation", a term the Chinese are using to refer to the shifting of their production capacity offshore.The enthusiasm of the Chinese for the early implementation of the ChAFTA agreement may well be a useful indicator as to who got the better deal.Within Australia, public discussion over the ChAFTA agreement has diminished somewhat of late. Back in September, the debate appeared to have reached an unresolvable stalemate, with Bill Shorten declaring the agreement a "dud deal" and stressing that Australia needed an agreement that "puts Australian jobs first", while DFAT head Peter Varghese publicly rehearsed the Government's claims as to how the agreement was good for us all. Meanwhile, Joanna Howe was warning that the ChAFTA "greatly increases the entry pathways for Chinese workers to enter the Australian labour market". What a difference two months make!The two sides of politics have now passed the enabling legislation, with parliamentary Labor apparently satisfied with the "safeguards" they have reportedly induced the Government to introduce as regulations governing labour market testing and 457 visas. DFAT provides details of the process by which the agreement will soon come into force. And, as the cherry on the cake, we have uninformed and decontextualised commentary claiming "no security risk in foreign investment".It must be recognised, however, that despite the apparent joint optimism about the agreement and its benefits for Australia, it is clear that a number of negative tangential shadows are being cast by ChAFTA.These will certainly affect Australia in the medium to long term, and need to be given due consideration alongside the celebratory back-slapping that will inevitably greet the coming into force of ChAFTA.The effects of ChAFTA on opportunities for Australian workers remain a key area of concern. The desire of the People's Republic of China (PRC) to have Chinese workers brought into Australia for Chinese-funded (and potentially other) projects - a practice pursued in Chinese economic activity across the globe - has been clear from the earliest negotiations.Statements on the desirability of Australia allowing more Chinese workers into the country and urging further relaxation of restrictions were made repeatedly by very senior PRC cadres during the process of ChAFTA negotiations.In May 2014, China's consul general in Sydney, Li Huaxin, stressed the importance of relaxing visa requirements for Chinese workers. Then, in November of that year, Li Ruogu, the chairman and president of the Export-Import Bank of China, told Australia that its labour costs were too high and it needed more Chinese workers, urging a further opening of the labour market.Less overt but very clear pressures on Australia during the negotiations aimed at reducing restrictions on the import of Chinese labour were reflected in a wide range of media. The desire and intent of the PRC leaders to expand Chinese labour export to Australia is thus very evident. And many will recognise China's unparalleled ability to get what it wants in asymmetric relationships. As noted, the import of Chinese labour is a common practice in Chinese economic activities around the world. A few examples of the processes and numbers involved will suffice, with studies on Latin America, Pakistan and Africa providing typical examples.The inclusion of Article 10.4.3 in ChAFTA, which provides that neither side shall "impose or maintain any limitations on the total number of visas to be granted to natural persons of the other Party; or require labour market testing, economic needs testing or other procedures of similar effect as a condition for temporary entry" was key for the PRC, as it enshrines these provisions as the principles of the FTA.They clearly offer much leeway for China in arguing its case for the import of Chinese workers and little in the way of protection for Australia workers. Article 4 of the associated MOU on Investment Facilitation allows Chinese firms to bring into Australia labour that would not meet the normal 457 visa requirements. The secrecy under which arrangements will be negotiated and signed under the MOU mean that there will be no public scrutiny of the concessions afforded to Chinese companies in terms of labour or other conditions.How can such arrangements be condoned by a Government led by an advocate of transparency or an opposition dedicated to the protection of Australian workers? This will inevitably further broadly reduce the transparency of industrial arrangements and worker conditions. Given the massive power of Chinese capital and the almost uncritical attitude the federal and other governments have adopted in respect of that capital, the regulations that the Government has promised to Labor will more than likely constitute but minor and adjustable obstacles.The effects of ChAFTA on Australia's industrial structure are equally of concern. The PRC's economic activities abroad - both state-owned and otherwise - follow a familiar pattern, one that will be common in Australia after the implementation of ChAFTA.PRC projects beyond China usually have Chinese financing, design, management, contractors and labour. Today the four largest banks in the world are PRC policy banks, and their resources are almost exclusively targeted at achieving PRC economic advantage and client dependency globally.The same can be said of state-linked financiers such as Minsheng. China's capacity to provide cheap finance to its firms abroad ensures that the projects it sees as necessary to the PRC's interests and strategies are pursued.Further, with their access to labour from China, PRC companies will enjoy even greater economic advantage vis-Ã -vis Australian firms.It is clear from global commercial examples that Chinese workers contracted for PRC economic activities abroad are usually paid their wages through accounts in China. Alternatively, where restraints on this practice exist and they are paid locally in accordance with existing labour regulations, there have been many reported cases of workers being required to remit almost the entirety of their wages to China where state agencies or firms extracted their share and paid the remainder to workers' accounts.If Chinese firms implement this model when they undertake projects in Australia, then whether or not the Australian Government declares that imported workers must be paid an award wage will be completely irrelevant, as all final accounting will be done by Chinese state organs or associated enterprises within China. As such, the cost of labour for such Chinese companies would be perhaps half of what labour costs would be to an Australian company.With Chinese firms enjoying the advantage of cheap financing and cheap labour, the Australian industrial landscape will no longer be an even playing field. Which Australian companies will be able to compete for infrastructural or other construction contracts in such an environment? In addition, under such arrangements, the vast majority of this wage income will leave the Australian economy rather than be recirculated within it, as would happen if Australian workers were employed on the proposed projects. The inevitable negative effects on the Australian economy are obvious.And this will not just be the case in the construction industries. State-owned and state-supported Chinese companies are pursuing similar practices in agricultural industries globally. During his recent visit to China, New Zealand opposition leader Andrew Little was told very openly by vice-president Li Yuanchao that China wants agricultural land globally, informing him that "arable land in other parts of the world are important to China and they are looking around for it".The PRC has reportedly allocated $3 trillion to secure food and farmland overseas. Examples of huge Chinese agricultural farms abroad, existing and planned, can be seen in the Ord River irrigation scheme, Ukraine, Siberia, Cameroon, Argentina and Brazil.Planned purchases in Australia include those by Dakang and Pengxin, and local concerns are already mounting. Again, access to cheap financing and cheap labour will ensure that Chinese firms will also dominate in this sector of the Australian economy. ChAFTA indeed facilitates this across most industries.As such, ChAFTA promises that, within the lifetimes of our children, there will be a rapid hollowing out of Australia's domestic industrial structure in many major spheres - construction, extractive industries, manufacturing and agriculture. The Australian economy will thereby become something of an offshore appendage to the Chinese economy.Geoff Wade is a Visiting Fellow at the Crawford School of Public Policy, ANU.

Comments for this story are closed.30 Nov 2015 1:12:04pmAbsolutely correct, Geoff Wade. There are no effective IR or wages controls if Chinese parent companies can make deductions and "adjustments" according to their local hiring contracts. The rapidity with which Labor has endorsed this deal does not auger well for the TPP. That's a deal that should be killed, buried, dug up, burned and buried again just to make sure it never gets a hold here. The Labor Party are done for as far as I am concerned. You lost my vote, Labor. I don't care how strong the economic or social pressure, neither of these deals do anything other than rape the Australian industrial relations landscape and shut our kids out of the jobs market.

IR laws will be modified to balance the difference in wages, and then Ozi workers will be labouring in Australian sweatshops and Gina Rinehart's mines alongside their counterparts from China. This is called "mixed economy." - All animals are equal.Hence, the Chinese ruling elite will be holding hands with the Australian ruling elite as they start singing "Happy Together." - Some animals are more equal than others.

01 Dec 2015 1:48:56amAustralian labour rates are indeed 'too high'. Why, they include such input cost baubles as adequate OH&S, superannuation, Medicare levies and penalty rates for socially negative hours. It is an outrage that any comparison can be made at all between Chinese and Australian wages - they represent, and pay for completely different things. And those things Australia's higher wages pay for are critical to the stable social structure we enjoy, with things like a basic safety net and universal healthcare. Labor's sell out in recent weeks, despite union control of the party, is a very odd situation indeed, and one I don't quite understand. I put it down to Shorten's irrelevance and lack of stature, big business lobbying and Liberal party dominance of the electoral landscape. All of our leaders are in it up to their eyeballs, and it's a disgraceful attack on fundamental Australian values. What's worse is that the Liberals class all this criticism as xenophobia, intimating that protecting the Australian labour market is somehow 'racist'. I don't want Australian labour standards and conditions driven down to Chinese standards, and I want Australians employed on jobs in this country over Chinese. Call it whatever your like.

01 Dec 2015 1:56:37amSons of Zaky, your comparison to 'colonialism' would make sense if Australians were regularly being sent overseas to work on projects where their salaries undercut the locals. I think this is a pretty rare occurence, if it's happened at all. Apart from the EU members, it's also virtually unheard of anywhere else too. By the way, I'd support any country, rich or not, protecting its workforce at the expense of overseas nationals. It's called 'territoriality'.

Which equates to; we will sell what ever we can and privatize any Government services, to balance the budget in the short term.In defence of the CFTA they(Government) tried to quash any negative responses by implying that opposition to the agreement is xenophobic.This article points out the very same results as those espoused  by others earlier this year, the difference here is that the studies under taken by the ANU have been carried out by people that come from China.These finding`s cannot be swept under the table by the Government and not acted upon.The future of our children and grand children is at stake as is the bottom line of the budget in the long term.

30 Nov 2015 6:05:28pmI think the catch cry is really 'Come all come all, buy your bit of Australia, everything is up for sale including citizenships'.  You got 5 million you can buy a visa.  If you got 50 million you can buy your citizenship.  It is no wonder they don't want too many asylum seekers getting in here on the cheap.  I think I now understand their meaning when they say 'we will decide who we allow in'.  The problem for asylum seekers is that they are paying the wrong people, people smugglers and the amount they have to pay is not enough. Understand me in that I have no problem with people imigrating to Australia.  Except for the Aboriginal peoples the rest of us are imigrants or decendents of them.  What I do have a problem with is selling off the country, selling off jobs and selling off citizenship to the highest bidders.

01 Dec 2015 2:05:47amYou're right: it's everywhere. Just look at the disappointment of the Kidman's that their huge landowning couldn't go to the highest bidder. And, if you're in Melbourne or Sydney's more desirable suburbs, that your property might not be able to be sold to a black-money Chinese investor (legally) using Australia's ponzi educational system as a mechanism to park their cash, despite the fact they're technically not allowed to take more than 80K out of the country. The common theme here is 'rich baby boomers', and unfortunately, there are still a fair few of them around in politics which is why this level of self-interested selling-out is tolerated, if not promoted. Once they die off however, I expect the next generation to react with fury, particularly those without rich boomer (read property owner) parents whose wealth is largley ascribable to being born at the right time, not anything they've actually produced.

Alert moderator
30 Nov 2015 3:12:22pmThat's not how it will work. Chinese employees will be employed by agencies in China who will deduct fees from the award wages paid under Australian law. These fees will either be kept by the agency (as a charge for providing foreign employment) or remitted to the actual employer (where the employment agency is actually a cover for the real employer). The net result is a Chinese worker who will not complain or their visa will be pulled and they will find themselves back in China, unemployed and in debt to the hiring agency. The Aussie employment books will be kept clean.Moreover, with the no-visa-limits policy Chinese employers can flood Australia with Chinese employees. They will look to end-to-end production chains, buying up farms and food processing plants and exporting everything -- goods, wages and profits -- back to China. Country towns will see Chinese enclaves built around such enterprises. Aussie kids will not get a look in.How many Workcover officials speak Chinese? That tells you that work safety agencies will not be able to effectively monitor safety in such businesses.

30 Nov 2015 4:29:22pmYes dave, everyone, except those responsible for signing off on the various trade deals, can see what is going to happen.No limits on visas translates to being over-run within a decade. Vertical integration will ensure that the only thing the Aus govt gets will be liabilities for tax write-offs by Chinese companies. They need only follow the Chevron Oil Co example of paying $248 tax on $1.7B revenue and they are home and hosed. To say I am over the turncoats in Canberra is an understatement.

30 Nov 2015 4:18:07pmHi iain russell. :)How do you compete with chinese/other people so desperate to work that they will accept salve wages and conditions (if that even?).When these exploited slaves can be imported under 'arrangements' which will exclude any competition/oversight/protection on wages etc level-playing field, who do you think the Chinese 'slave importers' will employ, even if Australians could do it better, safer?Profits and self-interest by profiteering 'businessmen' will become the 'norm' while you and others are lulled into making silly smart-aleck remarks which betray your total unpreparedness for, let alone awareness of, what pain is and will be going down all too soon for ourAustralian economy, society and our workers if we don't wake up quick smart.Let's hope we do, sooner than later. :)

30 Nov 2015 4:37:45pmNo Iain - Australia for Australian people (who are all sorts of skin colour - not just "white") Thankfully we have built this country by treating workers fairly, not like slaves. Many over the years have migrated here specifically because it is the land of the fair-go and people are treated well here. Why would we want to destroy that? What is there to gain by it? Why would we give a totalitarian regime like China power over our people? Its completely ludicrous.

The Chinese plan is have their workers come to Australia, learn all our skills and efficient work practices, and take them back to China and the rest of the world leaving us high and dry, uncompetitive in global terms, and having to work for third world remuneration.   In turn, that will leave us with a third world economy and third world living standards.

01 Dec 2015 2:21:26amWhile Australia's tradies and other semi-skilled workers are hardly 'world-class', could barely compete anywhere else, and are hardly in demand overseas (compared to say, German tradespeople in the EU) the point is that they make up a large proportion of Australian society, and their marginalisation via an influx of lesser paid Chinese workers will see us experience a very negative social impact. For what? So that we can have even more poorly built apartment blocks, or other low quality constructions that enrich the developers and no-one else. Not worth it.

30 Nov 2015 4:07:15pmIt seems the LNP have finally accomplished their covert aims to turn us into a third world country at the mercy of every carpet-bagger conman who wants to bribe the local politicians/leaders, institute a campaign of lies about how 'good for us' the deal is...and then proceed to suck us dry while we can't defend ourselves even if we do wake up to the scam. Because we made legal treaties; just like the natives did with our colonialist forebears...and see where that led for the locals: dispossessed and living on the scraps from the conmen's table. So much for Turnbull's 'agile and innovative' claims! Dunces, conmen and frontmen and bribery and corruption on a grand scale. Just look at what our CLP in Northern Territory just did, leasing Port Darwin to China for 99 years! Don't try to tell me no-one in CLP/Advisors etc got any quid-pro-quo in advance for supporting/voting accordingly in that stupid sell-off of significant and sensitive National Facility. If you do, I won't believe you. So save your breath. Oh the gullibility and brazen deceit of it all. Any wonder why our politicians/leaders have become targets of suspicion and ridicule in their own country as well as abroad. How embarrassing for all thinking Australians. :(

30 Nov 2015 4:37:27pmGeoff, my understanding is that many Australian workers within the building industry are really concerned about their future for already there is rorting involving 'job sharing' whereby Chinese workers swap documents to enter work-sites & work for less than the award. This is not in Australia's best interest & those allowing the practice of overseas workers on 457 visas to swap documents & share jobs should be run out of the industry.

30 Nov 2015 5:09:46pmExcellent read Geoff cheers mate.Here I was thinking only FiFo work would be cruelled. Surely no Australian Govt in its right mind would do such a thing? Surely no opposition would agree with such a thing?  Sadly no. One former PM , whos now on the backbench , played the racist card whenever it was brought up and the Opposition seemingly caved when an advertising campaign was about to launch.I have noted with interest the amount of Australian billionaires and multi millionaires buying dairy farms by the dozen. So much for Aussies not willing to part with cash for agriculture. Thank you for the well researched and informative article fella. Unfortunately due to the noise of the Govt funded indoctrination , I mean ad , playing on TV no one can hear you.

30 Nov 2015 5:39:07pmLet's do two things first under the new ChAFTA:1. Pay our pollies the same salaries that their Chinese counterparts get.2. Bring over some parliamentarians from China under 457 visas (need to fire a few of our own) to make cost savings.

30 Nov 2015 8:10:17pmHaving worked at a private school in China I got a glimpse of how things work and learned some sometimes unpleasant lessons. On the micro scale I can see how this will probably affect us on the macro scale. A contract binds the worker but not the employer - they were ropeable when I and my colleagues took industrial action! They even used the police to detain my Australian colleague when he tried to leave. Heaven help the Chinese workers, and good luck to Aussies if they are employed under Chinese owners. The rule of law is pretty much absent, only the rule of power. Whatever the deficiencies of our industrial, civil and criminal laws, we live in a legal paradise compared to China. The Party always gets its share, if it isn't actually behind the whole enterprise. Strategic madness to sell anything within cooee of our military.China absolutely believes that it is at the centre of the world and acts accordingly - so once Australia has been dutchessed we are merely a satellite. Business and diplomacy is a theatrical event and acting will be used to maximum effect. So brinksmanship,'non-negotiable' hard line items, moral blackmail ("would you have us lose face?"), etc are just standard negotiating ploys. If they really want something you can get better terms.Corruption and nepotism is endemic. Paying off he right people is just the cost of business, so expect that to increase in Australia on a grand scale. Not that I don't think China has a lot to offer, that I don't like the Chinese or that I regret for a moment working in and visiting China. Nor do I believe I understand China, just that obviously our politicians clearly know far less than the little I have gleaned. Beware of the Dragon. Don't be afraid to say no, and tear up that appalling agreement - now.

30 Nov 2015 8:47:30pmThis is how Free Trade, TPP etc agreements are supposed to work. The market moves to the lowest cost of production and those businesses with the most market power (ie monopolies), will outcompete higher cost companies, removing the risk of market competition.The only difference with the ChFTA to other trade agreements, it is China's State National monopoly power rather than that of Capitalist multi-national monopolies that control the so-called 'unregulated' market.

30 Nov 2015 9:36:26pmThe LNP stuffed up the USFTA and now they have sold our sovereignty to China. I consider, Abbott and Robb to be guilty of nothing less than treason  against the people of Australia. The Liberal party are worthy of destruction and the Multi Nationals are even more guilty. A few citizenships should be revoked, started with ten pound Pom Tony.
