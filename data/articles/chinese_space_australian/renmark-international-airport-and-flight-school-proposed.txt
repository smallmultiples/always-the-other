A proposal to sell the Renmark Airport and transform it into an international airport exporting fresh produce and housing an international flying school is under consideration.The ambitious bid was submitted to Renmark Paringa Council and discussed in confidence this month.Council chief executive Tony Siviour today announced it had invited Sino Australia Clean Energy Company (Sino Australia) to submit a more detailed proposal.Council has agreed to an exclusive negotiating period with Sino Australia for 12 months.Sino Australia heads up an international consortium of Australian, Chinese and Asian investors."All council has agreed is to undertake a process to consider the proposal in further detail which will involve liaising with Government departments via the Coordinator General," Mr Siviour said.Under the proposal the Renmark airport would become a transport hub, exporting freight direct into Asian markets.It is expected to be predominantly Riverland citrus and stonefruit and local growers are believed to be involved in early negotiations.Custom-built cooled storage at the airport would allow for fresh produce including seafood from other regions to be transported to Renmark and then exported direct to Asia.The complex proposal also involves establishing an International flying School at Renmark airport and student accommodation on land on the corner of Paringa and Seventeenth streets. Up to 400 students would live and study at both the Aviation school and an agricultural and business facility within the Renmark school precinct.There are also plans for a high-end tourist eco-accommodation resort. Currently the Renmark airport houses a 2km runway and hangers.It was built in 1935 and originally operated as a Commonwealth aerodrome.It was taken over by Renmark council in 1975 and continues to be used by private operators and the Royal Flying Doctors' Service (RFDS). Commercial flights by Qantaslink to Mildura and Adelaide ceased about 20 years ago.The bid would involve a significant upgrade of the airport including extending the runway to a required distance of 3.2km. It would need biosecurity and customs presence.Mr Siviour said council had the ability to sell the Renmark Airport as it was excluded from the Community Land classification in 2000 with the intent to allow commercial proposals.He said arrangements with current airport users including the RFDS would remain unchanged."At this stage council has made no commitments or decisions to sell any assets including the Renmark Airport," Mr Siviour said."Council has, however, indicated to Sino Australia that the current arrangements for airport users with hangers and the Royal Flying Doctors are to remain unchanged and the airport is to remain open to other users if councildoes proceed to Stage 3 (of) contract negotiation."A privately-owned regional international airport has been established at Toowoomba in southern Queensland.The facility services the Queensland livestock and horticultural industries and exports direct to China.It was the brainchild of the Wagner family, which wanted fast and easy access into the lucrative and rapidly expanding Chinese markets.Toowoomba Surat Basin Enterprise chief executive Ben Lyons said developing a viable business plan had been critical to the venture's success."You have to go to the airlines with something more than basically this is a road in the middle of a paddock," Mr Lyons said."We went with our supply side story, which in the Darling Downs and Greater Region is very strong, particularly in red meat and horticulture."Quick market access remains a priority for many Australian exporters."Potentially for us it's easier to service a restaurant in Shanghai than Melbourne," he said.
