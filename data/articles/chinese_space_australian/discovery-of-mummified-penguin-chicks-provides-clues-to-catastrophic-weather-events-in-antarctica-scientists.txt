Australian and Chinese scientists have discovered hundreds of mummified penguin chicks on Long Peninsula in Antarctica.The researchers said the find sheds light on the effects of two catastrophic weather events that decimated breeding colonies in the area, and could also unlock clues about the impact of climate change on Antarctic penguin populations.A study published in the Journal of Geophysical Research —Biogeosciences analysed sediment at the site where researchers found the mummified baby birds.Scientists said the discovery holds clues to two massive weather-related calamities that wiped out large numbers of birds, one about 200 years ago and one around 750 years ago.They also said these events could become more common in future due to the effects of climate change.The remains of the Adélie penguin chicks were found in heavy sediments on Long Peninsula, east Antarctica.The discovery revealed significant water run-off at the site, and also helped to unlock the timeline of the weather events that decimated the penguins.Most of the carcasses turned out to be from two breeding colonies about 750 and 200 years ago. "First of all, the extent of carcasses and abandoned colonies struck us," University of Science and Technology of China researcher Yuesong Gao said."Then we were surprised by the consistent dates of the mummies. "We had expected a much larger range of dates."The researchers were also struck by the unusually thick layers of sediment in which the mummified baby birds were buried. Researchers found evidence of a lot of water flowing over the surface of the site over a short period of time.This would have been deadly for penguin chicks that had not yet grown their waterproof feathers."We found that relatively short periods of climate anomaly in the past have caused terrible consequences to the penguin population," Mr Gao said.If die-off events like those of 200 and 750 years ago become more common, it could be bad news for penguins on the Adélie Coast, according to the study's authors."We should pay attention to the threats of climate change to penguins," Mr Gao said.
