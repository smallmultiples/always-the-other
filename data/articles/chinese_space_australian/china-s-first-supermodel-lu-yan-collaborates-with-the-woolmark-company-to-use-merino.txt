China's first supermodel has partnered with the iconic Woolmark Company to produce a fashion range made almost entirely from Australian merino wool.Lu Yan, who had her debut on the international catwalks as a teenager 17 years ago, is a well-known name in China.Now retired from modelling and married with a young son, the 35-year-old has become a respected fashion designer over the past four years.Her label, Comme Moi, was the first Chinese brand to collaborate with The Woolmark Company on a specifically wool-based range which was launched late last year.Yan, who works in the trendy French concession of Shanghai, said she wanted to use wool because "it represents high quality" and was warm and functional.The designer's path to success reads like a rags-to-riches story.She grew up in the small village of Jiang Xi in southern China but was talent scouted as an 18-year-old."Two French agents came to Beijing and they met me in the lobby of one of the hotels and they tried to talk to me and say 'do you want to go to Paris to be a model?'" Yan said."For someone to go out of China at that time, that was a big deal."Nobody in her home town had ever owned a passport, let alone travelled to Europe. Yan could not speak French or English but was determined to succeed at modelling."They think I'm special, they say you can work a lot in Paris," she said. "But you know for me at that time I never even think of [being] famous or anything else, it was more to make money to survive."It was not easy though; while tall and graceful, Yan does not have the wide doe eyes or soft girlish features that were traditional signs of Chinese beauty."Actually in Chinese tradition, they don't like my look, for them I cannot be a model," she said."They called me the 'ugly duckling'."Yan had the last laugh though.  She modelled all over the world for a decade and paved the way for other young Chinese women wanting to work in the cut-throat industry, before returning to her home country in 2010. Against the wishes of her family, who thought she would be better off becoming an actor, strong-willed Yan decided to start her own fashion label."For fashion, I can decide who I want to work with, I can decide the style I want, I can choose the photographer I want," she said."For modelling you cannot really [have] control."I can decide everything, so I said 'you know what, I have a feeling I can do it'."I wanted to do it, so I did." With a staff of about 30 people, Comme Moi's design studio is nestled among the small boutiques and cool cafes of Shanghai's South Shaanxi Road.Yan became involved with Australian wool after being asked to judge at a Woolmark fashion show, which led to talks with Australian Wool Innovation, which owns the internationally recognised Woolmark brand.The result was the China Rouge winter range of garments."Because in China, every holiday like Christmas, New Year they have a special tradition to wear red,"  Yan said."Red means a lot to the Chinese."Yan said she had learned more about wool since working with Australian Merino, but that most Chinese consumers have "no real idea" where wool comes from.
