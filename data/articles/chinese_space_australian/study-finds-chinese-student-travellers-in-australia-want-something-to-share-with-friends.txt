Chinese students in their first year of studies in Australia are emerging as a new market for regional and outback tourism destinations.University of Queensland (UQ) research into the travel preferences and behaviours of Chinese students in Queensland found the best time to attract young visitors was at the end of their first year, and operators needed to offer an experience students could share with their friends.Dr Gabby Walters and Dr Monica Chien, from the university's School of Business, studied 600 Chinese students from six south-east Queensland universities, to learn how they perceived regional and outback Queensland.They found only 15 per cent had any knowledge of regional Queensland or the outback, but were looking for new experiences to share with their friends online."And when their mums and dads and friends come to visit, they are likely to take them to those destinations as well," Dr Chien said.Figures from the office of the Minister for Tourism and International Education, show 136,097 Chinese students were enrolled in the Australian education sector in 2015.The UQ study identified two groups of Chinese student traveller: those who were keen to go bush (60 per cent) and those who preferred city-based tourism (40 per cent).The bush travellers were willing to travel outside the capital cities and were nature lovers keen for encounters with wildlife. Dr Chien said this segment was an ideal market for regional and outback destinations."They want to see different places [and] they want to try unique experiences â€” the experiences they can't get back home," Dr Chien said."So, they would like to go exploring, learn about wildlife, learn about Indigenous culture."The second cohort was city-based travellers who were concerned about safety and were not really interested in a nature or wildlife experience."What we found across both groups is that cost, accessibility and time were the key influences for students," Dr Chien said."If tourism operators, when they come up with strategies or campaigns, can bear these factors in mind, that would ease the anxiety among some of the students." The Travel Preferences and Behaviours of Chinese Students in Queensland research was commissioned by Tourism and Events Queensland.China has been identified as Australia's most valuable inbound tourism market.Tourism Australia estimates the market contributed $3.26 billion to the Australian economy in 2010 and by 2020, has the potential to contribute $7 to $9 billion annually.The UQ researchers said regional Queensland would have to help visitors overcome a fear of the unknown, accustom travellers to regional landscapes, and bridge the communication barrier."Trying to instil a sense of familiarity could actually reduce the perceived safety issues," Dr Chien said."For example, having Mandarin-speaking staff, Mandarin language websites or even menus in the restaurants will probably help to ease that perception of risk."Students' number one ranked activity was eating out, and study participants mentioned Queensland's short trading hours and lack of variety in food and restaurants as a possible impediment to travel within the state.The study found November and December were the main window of opportunity for Chinese students to travel in Australia.Students were unlikely to make last-minute bookings, and usually planned one to three months in advance, so August would be the best time to offer promotional deals.They also relied on social media and word of mouth rather than using travel agencies.Dr Chien said a recent Queensland Rail offer to outback Queensland had increased travel to the region by 50 per cent and this style of holiday was likely to appeal to students."Going on a rail trip is something new and different for them," Dr Chien said."They could simply enjoy the scenery and company of their friends from the comfortable air-conditioned carriage but at the same time, [it would] allow them to do some activities along the way."
