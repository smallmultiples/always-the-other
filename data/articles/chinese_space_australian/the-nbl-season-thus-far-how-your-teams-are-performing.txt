As the National Basketball League pauses to allow the Boomers to compete in two qualifying matches for the 2019 World Cup, teams are using the break to assess where their season is headed.Here is how your team is looking.It is an odd season for the NBL as the league is on hold for two weeks while the Australian national team faces Chinese Taipei and Japan on its road to the basketball World Cup.While many of the national players are tied up with NBA duties, the team's NBL contingent have been released from club duties for the games.The regular season NBL will resume on Thursday 30 November with the Sydney Kings versus Cairns Taipans, but the break is proving a valuable opportunity for teams to rest their injured and formulate an attack for the rest of the season.Here is how your team is placed heading into this break. The competition's blue collar side started slow with a string of losses, followed by a run of wins that was only halted in their last game in Cairns.The draw of death that saw the Hawks play nine of their first 12 games on the road has proved to be a challenge the team has weathered."It's probably one of the most welcome breaks we wanted," Hawks coach Rob Beveridge said. "It was unbelievably tough physically, mentally, and emotionally for the group, and we knew it was going to be like that — when the schedule came out, it was ridiculous."Star guard Rotnei Clarke has continued his usual high standard of form, contributing 19.2 points per game on average, while new import Demitrius Conger is supporting him with 16.8 points per game.Forward Nick Kay has been rewarded for his consistent form with Boomers selection.The Hawks will need to capitalise on a seven-game run of games in Wollongong to cement a position in the top four. Dark days for the Sydney franchise started early in the season, and despite significant roster changes, losses, and an injury to their captain Kevin Lisch, may have ruled them out of the playoffs before the season has really set in.A roster that was widely criticised for lacking balance has now injected NBA big, Jeremy Tyler, and former league MVP, Jerome Randle, at significant cost.There are plenty of games left in the season for the Kings to turn their form around, but if the other teams that have dominated the season so far continue to do so, there might not be any room in the top four to squeeze in.A shining light in the darkness has been import Perry Ellis, who is averaging 19.2 points per game. In a positive sign, the Bullets' second season back in the NBL looks to be more successful than their last.Still, many of the club's early signs point to a season that could see them finish somewhere in the middle of the ladder.Import guard Perrin Buford has been a one-man highlight machine and fellow guards, Travis Trice and Stephen Holt, have proved competent without being outstanding.The Bullets are getting good value out of Australian veteran Daniel Kickert, but face an unwelcome away game on December 1 against a fired-up Adelaide 36ers.The 36ers just delighted in playing themselves back into form against their old team mate Jerome Randle and the Sydney Kings.They are also down their head coach Andrej Lemanis during the break while he returns to his other job as the coach of the Boomers.  Adelaide has always been a team that wears its heart on its sleeve, and the 2017/18 season is no exception.If coach Joey Wright is angry with his players, expect to see that play out on national television.If a player is being benched for disciplinary reasons, expect that to be aired at a press conference.The 36ers are a team that lives and dies with the passion of their players and coach and over the years, other teams have exploited that.By the same token, when it's working, they are a unit that loves outrunning the opposition and can be ruthless in scoring fast transition baskets. It remains to be seen what the addition of Josh Childress will mean for the club, but the man has a long history of personal success, even if his team is not winning.  The Taipans share the same win/loss record as their regional brothers Illawarra, and have shown moments of brilliance coupled with a few games they would rather forget.On one hand they beat competition leaders NZ Breakers before handing fellow heavyweights Perth a 90-69 hiding.They were then comprehensively beaten 87-65 by Melbourne United a couple of weeks later.The North Queensland side has shown enough to indicate they will be competitive this season, but in a league dominated by star imports, they will want more than the 11.8 points per game they are getting from import guard Dayshon 'Scoochie' Smith. Probably the biggest surprise of the season has been how inconsistent Melbourne United have been.Having assembled a superstar side featuring Casey Prather, Josh Boone, Casper Ware, Chris Goulding, and David Anderson, United has struggled to reach its potential.One moment they almost beat Oklahoma City Thunder in an NBA pre-season game, the next they were getting beaten 91-59 on their home court by Perth.Early appendicitis for Chris Goulding was a setback, but with the addition of coach Dean Vickerman, Melbourne fans were expecting something special this year.What they got so far are signs of a team that may take more than one season to reach that potential.They also have two storied franchises, who have made it their business to sit at the top of the NBL ladder, standing in their way.   It comes as no surprise to the NBL community that Perth is near the top of the ladder.Despite losing Casey Prather to Melbourne, they have replaced him with the equally exciting JP Tokoto, who is enjoying a stellar first year in the NBL.Bryce Cotton is still showing signs of the brilliance that won his team last year's grand final, Damian Martin is still the benchmark for the league's defence, Angus Brandt continues his rise to one of the league's best big men and Perth Arena remains as hostile as ever.It might be a new season, but some things never change, and Perth — a team that has never missed the playoffs — remains near the top of the ladder, a position they have become accustomed to.The retirement of Matt Knight has called into question the ability of Derek Cooke Jr to be a backup forward to Brandt, but early signs indicate he is up for the challenge of proving himself to a club that in the past has shown it is not afraid to sack players mid-season. While it should not come as a surprise to see the Breakers at the top of the ladder, given their run of recent playoffs and championships, the way in which the New Zealand franchise has completely dominated the competition is a shock.Whether it is a clutch three-point shot to sink Cairns on the buzzer or a reliable team effort while Kirk Penney sat out for personal reasons, the Breakers have been impressive.Faced with a round six double against Perth Wildcats, the Breakers first won at home, then did it again in the most hostile environment for an away team in Australia.The team quietly recruited silky scorers Edgar Sosa and DJ Newbill, continued to shape the development of young guard Shea Ili, and then let veterans Mika Vukona, Kirk Penney, Alex Pledger, and Tom Abercrombie continue their usual high standard.The result? The Breakers are soaring — two wins clear of Perth and on a nine game winning streak.
