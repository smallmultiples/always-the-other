The worst case scenario of a global trade war is that Australia's exchange rate could surge by 6 per cent, but the nation's economy could shrink by 2.5 per cent.It would then lead to the unemployment rate rising 0.25 per cent and inflation falling by 0.2 per cent.Those findings appeared in an internal report, prepared by the Reserve Bank in March, released in response to a freedom of information request from Bloomberg.The research was conducted before the Trump administration had decided to exempt Australia from its steel and aluminium tariffs.In that scenario:To "largely offset these effects in the long term", the Reserve Bank said it could then cut the official cash rate by 0.5 percentage points to a new "record low" of 1 per cent.The Australian dollar tumbled below 60 US cents a decade ago after America's fourth-largest investment bank Lehmann Brothers collapsed — an event which is largely credited as the trigger for the global financial crisis. Australia's central bankers recognised that, under normal circumstances, a deteriorating global economy would lead to more "risk aversion", lower commodity prices and a fall in the local currency.If that were to happen, the RBA thought that a weaker currency could be beneficial "as it would support exports" to Australia's trading partners.The bank considered that the "lucky country" might not be as vulnerable compared to other nations."On the other hand, Australia may be less exposed to the scenario than other economies that rely more on global trade flows as a source of demand for their products and who have larger manufacturing sectors," the RBA said in its internal report.Earlier this week, the US and China escalated their trade war by imposing further tariffs on each other's goods.Washington slapped a further 10pc tariff on US$200 billion worth of Chinese imports. In response, Beijing announced 5-10 per cent tariffs on just US$60 billion in American imports."Other things equal, a US-China trade war is likely to adversely affect the US, Chinese and Australian economies," the RBA warned in its report.Those sentiments were repeated more recently, in the minutes of the RBA's September meeting, when it warned there were still "significant tensions around global trade policy and that this represented a material risk to the [economic] outlook".Australia is in a difficult position. It is one of the most China-dependent economies in the world, but the US is a key defence ally.China accounts for 29 per cent of exports, particularly commodity metals — making it Australia's largest trading partner.In contrast, the US accounts for just 6.8 per cent, the central bank noted."A negative shock to Chinese exports would weigh on commodity demand, but any compensating domestic stimulus (akin to the response to the GFC export shock) could provide an offset," the RBA wrote.But the downside is it would come at "the cost of exacerbating longer-term structural problems and contributing to financial risk".
