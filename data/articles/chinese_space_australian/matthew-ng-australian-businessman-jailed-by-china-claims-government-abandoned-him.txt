An Australian entrepreneur jailed after a business dispute with the Chinese government claims the Australian Government "abandoned" him.In an open letter to Federal Attorney-General George Brandis, Matthew Ng said he was innocent of the bribery and embezzlement charges brought against him in China and pleaded for his early release.Mr Ng was jailed in Guangzhou in 2010 on charges relating to the planned sale of his $100 million stake in travel company, GZL.He was arrested after he refused to comply with demands to sell his lucrative stake in GZL back to the minority shareholder — the Chinese government — at cost price.Mr Ng served four years in a squalid Chinese jail in cramped and unhygienic conditions.Late last year, he became the first Australian to benefit from a prisoner swap deal between China and Australia and is now serving out the rest of his sentence at St Heliers Jail in the NSW Hunter Valley.The sentence expires in 2022, but he will be eligible for parole in August next year.Mr Ng has always maintained his innocence and wants a pardon and early release from custody on humanitarian grounds.In his letter to Mr Brandis, he complained the lack of progress on his application was "scandalous in a land which prides itself in rule of law, respect for human rights, fairness and compassion"."Am I not natural to feel indignant and abandoned by some key decision-makers in this Liberal conservative Australian Government?" Mr Ng wrote.Worst still, my eldest daughter Isabella ... died from depression and an eating disorder shortly after I lost my appeal in China. Mr Ng said even if he were guilty of the "fabricated" crimes in China, he would have only served two years for similar offences in Australia."It is heartbreaking to think but I am convinced that I would not be the last Australian who would fall prey to the dark side of Chinese judicial system, given now the FTA with China has been signed to encourage more trade and investments with China," he wrote."In the last 1,691 days, I have lost my freedom, health, wealth and dignity."Worst still, my eldest daughter Isabella ... died from depression and an eating disorder shortly after I lost my appeal in China."She could not accept the harshness and cruelty of my sentence."I came back to discover that my marriage of 18 years is on the brink as the long-suffering injustice and ordeal has taken a heavy toll on my wife's life and the lives of my three surviving children".Mr Ng said the idea that pardoning him would enrage China is a "misconception"."The power for you to pardon me is clearly intended in the treaty with China," he wrote."If Australia fails to right the wrongs done to her citizens back on her soil, would China respect Australia and care about any consequences at all in the future?"Transfers under the ITP scheme are not intended to provide a more lenient alternative for the prisoner Mr Ng said, after being a victim of judicial corruption and government manipulation under a totalitarian regime, he found himself "hopeless and powerless to end my injustice ordeal, save my family from falling apart, clear my name and rebuild my life"."Please make the right decision to end this injustice," he wrote."Grant me the pardon and immediate release, for me, my family and for the protection, care and hope of all Australians."In a statement to the ABC, the Federal Attorney-General's Department said the purpose of the International Transfer of Prisoners (ITP) scheme with China was to promote the rehabilitation of the prisoner while preserving the sentence originally imposed."Transfers under the ITP scheme are not intended to provide a more lenient alternative for the prisoner," the statement said.The ABC has sought further comment from Mr Brandis on the letter.
