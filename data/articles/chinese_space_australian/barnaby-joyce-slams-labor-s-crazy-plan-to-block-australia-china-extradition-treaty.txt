The Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has furiously denounced Labor's decision to vote with the crossbench and block the Australia-China extradition treaty, calling the decision "crazy." "I can't believe that, to be honest, the Labor party is going to participate in this," Mr Joyce said."They know that this is crazy. Surely there's a trade minister, or an attorney-general or whatever who understands the ramifications — that if the Labor party participates in this they show that they've really evolved not into an alternate party but into some sort of sensational band of rubbish."The treaty has stoked widespread unease in Parliament, with MPs on both sides of politics arguing Australia should not send people to China because the country's judicial system is plagued with human rights abuses.The Senate now looks likely to scuttle the deal, after Labor's shadow cabinet decided last night it would join the Senate crossbench and back a motion from newly independent Senator Cory Bernardi to stop it being ratified. The ALP caucus will make a final decision on the issue this morning.But the Deputy Prime Minister said there were significant safeguards in the treaty, and ministers would be able to stop an extradition if there were concerns about an individual's welfare when they arrive in China."As sure as God made little green apples, there are people in China that think the way they can get out of a crime is to get on a plane and get to somewhere else as quickly as possible," he said."That doesn't mean they didn't commit a crime in China. The minister at any point of time can say no we're not going to extradite that person.""I think that's a pretty safe deal, and that's the way it should work."The Government has been furiously lobbying the crossbench over the treaty but so far it hasn't managed to shift the numbers. Senator Bernardi stood by his motion this morning."[China] has a 99 per cent conviction rate, about 1.3 million people are found guilty, and a thousand are found not guilty. that doesn't strike me as an open and transparent legal system," Senator Bernardi said.Justice Minister Michael Keenan has also been facing backbench angst on the issue.Mr Keenan and Attorney-General George Brandis briefed around 10 Coalition MPs about the deal on Monday afternoon.Many of those MPs are concerned about the Government's decision to push ahead with ratification of the agreement, which has been stuck in limbo for a decade after being signed by the Howard governmentThey also point to China's poor human rights record, and are sceptical about the Government's assurances that safeguards within the agreement will offer sufficient protection to Australians deported there.Former prime minister Tony Abbott told The Australian newspaper he is among them."I'd be very, very cautious about ratifying this treaty at this time," he said. The Opposition flagged concerns about ratification in a parliamentary report released last year, calling for a review of the Extradition Act to ensure it was consistent with international legal obligations.The shadow cabinet discussed its position on Monday night, and Labor will make a final decision at its caucus meeting today.Several Labor sources said the shadow cabinet was persuaded to block the treaty because of human rights concerns. It is expected they will seek to build in a review mechanism, so the deal can be ratified in future if the situation changes.Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said it was a matter of great importance."It goes to questions of our relationship with China [but] it goes, of course, to human rights, and it goes to questions of law," he said.The Government briefed Labor on the changes on Monday, and argued blocking ratification could offend China and do enormous damage to the bilateral relationship.Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull warned killing off the treaty could undermine cooperation between Australian and Chinese law enforcement agencies."The treaty … needs to be ratified. We are urging the opposition and the crossbenchers to support the ratification," Mr Turnbull said."There are very considerable protections in the treaty, and it is an important part of our cooperation with China on law enforcement."
