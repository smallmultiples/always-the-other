A Gold Coast MP says a free trade agreement (FTA) with China could devastate the city's construction industry.A declaration of intent was signed this week, reducing tariffs on health, education and financial services.The Member for Gaven, Dr Alex Douglas, said Chinese investors may choose to hire international employees."We have a problem with rising unemployment and anything that threatens employment of the people here in Australia, wherever they live, this has got to be strongly considered as a problem, it is not an equal deal between China and ourselves," he said.However, the federal Member for Moncrieff, Steven Ciobo, said Chinese investors would still be bound by Australian labour laws."The China Australia free trade agreement ensures all the same safeguards that apply now, in relation to being able to import labour, still continue to apply," he said."There's no change at all and frankly anyone who runs around trying to scare the community into claiming it's going to see a cohort of cheap foreign labour coming into the country is 100 per cent wrong."
