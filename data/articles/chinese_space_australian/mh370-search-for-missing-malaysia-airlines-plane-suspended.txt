The search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 has been suspended, with authorities unable to locate the aircraft in the Indian Ocean. The passenger plane carrying 239 passengers and crew, including six Australians, disappeared on March 8, 2014 while travelling between Kuala Lumpur and Beijing.Its disappearance is one of the greatest mysteries in aviation history, with authorities unsuccessfully searching 120,000 square kilometres of the ocean floor.In a joint statement, the Australian, Malaysian and Chinese governments said the decision to abandon the search was not taken lightly, or without sadness."Despite every effort using the best science available, cutting-edge technology, as well as modelling and advice from highly skilled professionals who are the best in their field, unfortunately, the search has not been able to locate the aircraft," the statement said."Whilst combined scientific studies have continued to refine areas of probability, to date no new information has been discovered to determine the specific location of the aircraft."In July last year authorities warned the hunt would be suspended if the latest search did not yield any results. The three Government representatives said they had been overwhelmed by the commitment and dedication of those involved in the search."Their tireless work has continued to improve our knowledge of the search area and has been critical in our efforts to locate the aircraft," the statement said."We would like to reiterate our utmost appreciation to the many nations that have provided expertise and assistance since the early days of this unfortunate tragedy."David Lawton, the brother of one of the passengers on board MH370 when it went down, said he had been expecting the search to be suspended for some time. "The search has been going on for a long time and they haven't come up with anything. It can't go on forever," he said."It's going to be a bit of a shock for my parents because [they are] still very upset over it."I don't think they're ever going to find any part of the plane, it's been too long now."Earlier this month, Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai rejected calls from relatives of passengers on board the MH370 to extend the search. Australian authorities also rejected calls to extend the search, claiming there was a lack of credible evidence.A total of 33 pieces of wreckage suspected to be from the plane have been found, including parts of wings and a tail, on the shores of Mauritius, the French Indian Ocean island of Reunion, Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa.The three representatives, including Australian Transport Minister Darren Chester, said the announcement was an important development for the families of passengers and crew."We again take this opportunity to honour the memory of those who have lost their lives and acknowledge the enormous loss felt by their loved ones," they said."We remain hopeful that new information will come to light and that at some point in the future the aircraft will be located."In December, an Australian Government report found authorities had likely been looking in the wrong section of ocean."There is a high degree of confidence that the previously identified underwater area searched to date does not contain the missing aircraft," the Australian Transport Safety Bureau report said.At the time, Mr Chester said he was still hopeful authorities would find the plane in the search area.A report released by the ATSB a month earlier found it was unlikely the Boeing 777 was in a controlled descent when it crashed into the ocean.
