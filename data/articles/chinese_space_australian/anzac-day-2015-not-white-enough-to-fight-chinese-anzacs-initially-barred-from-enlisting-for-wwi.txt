More than 200 Chinese Anzacs who fought bravely for Australia during WWI were almost stopped from enlisting because they were not of "sufficient European origin or descent".When war broke out, an Act of Parliament in line with the White Australia Policy prevented any man who was not white from signing up to go to war.This included Chinese-Australians born here after their parents came for the gold rush of the late 1800s.Historian Emily Cheah Ah-Qune said some managed to sneak through and go to Gallipoli early in the campaign, but the majority were turned away on sight."We do know for a fact that some of the men who tried to enlist were barred from enlisting by medical officers because they were not substantially European enough," she said.Ms Cheah Ah-Qune is curator of the Chinese Anzacs exhibition at Melbourne's Chinese Museum.She and her colleagues discovered at least 218 Chinese-Australians went to the front, but most were forced to wait until the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) needed reinforcements."At that time, Australia had suffered heavy losses in the war and they just wanted to raise enough numbers and send these young men overseas," Ms Cheah Ah-Qune said.The law had not been changed but Ms Cheah Ah-Qune suggested: "Perhaps the rules were relaxed, perhaps medical officers were no longer as stringent in the criteria, and perhaps other young men saw what others had sacrificed for the country and went 'you know what? I'm going too'."Victorian man Benjamin Moy Ling tried to enlist twice, before he was finally accepted in 1917 at the age of 31.He served with the 60th Battalion and later with the 4th Divisional Signals Company. Mr Moy Ling's great-niece, Serena Cheung, said her great-uncle wanted to enlist because he said at the time: "If Australia's good enough to live in, it's good enough to fight for."She is very proud of the job her great-uncle Ben did on the Western Front, but shakes her head knowing the law meant he was nearly never sent there."These days we would call it discrimination," Ms Cheung said."But there were no qualms about it; it was written across the earlier applications forms."I guess in those days one couldn't really protest against that, but it makes one feel angry that he was discriminated against."Mr Moy Ling survived the war and returned to his home in Melbourne in 1919."We are very proud of him and I wonder what he would think if he knew the subject of this story," Ms Cheung said.The delay in Chinese Anzacs joining the AIF probably saved many of their lives.Ms Cheah Ah-Qune said just 36 of the 218 soldiers she and her colleagues have researched died in battle.Many of those who survived were recognised with military honours."Of the Chinese-Australians that we have managed to research, 19 of them won 23 gallantry awards so that's quite substantial," Ms Cheah Ah-Qune said."One of them was actually awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre, which is one of the highest awards you could possibly have."There are some families who are very hesitant to own up to Chinese heritage even today, quite possibly because of the legacy of the White Australia Policy."But [descendants of Chinese Anzacs] should be proud because they are a large part of Australian history." Kevin Hughes only learned of his Chinese heritage over the past few years and has discovered he had three Chinese-Australian great-uncles who fought on the Western Front in France. Mr Hughes said Thomas, David and John originally had the surname of Huey, but somewhere along the line that changed to Hughes and for a long time he and his family thought their background was Welsh."It is all new, fascinating and interesting," Mr Hughes said of learning about the Chinese chapter in his family's history."Suddenly [my family] is talking about things that we'd never talked about."Thomas Huey was a prolific postcard writer while he was at war and sent a number of French embroidered postcards to his sister Rosetta, Mr Hughes' grandmother."Give my kindest regards to all the mothers and sisters, dearest sister. And you be a good girl and look after yourself with great care and always remember, if I have the great fortune to return, I will always look after you. Well darling sister, I will conclude with fondest love, goodbye. Your brother Tom xxxxxxxxx.""Even though I didn't know them and they're not the most direct link to the family because it's just a great-uncle, they still appear so personal," Mr Hughes said."I can read them time and time again and you certainly get a sense of almost being there.""When the hot weather came on the stench was awful. There was dead Germans laying all over the place. Of course we soon got used to all these sights. We had barbed wire paddocks just near us where the German prisoners was (sic) kept. They used to look awful when they was brought in, dirty and not shaved and half starving. Will let you know more later, as in a letter. From your loving brother, Tom."
