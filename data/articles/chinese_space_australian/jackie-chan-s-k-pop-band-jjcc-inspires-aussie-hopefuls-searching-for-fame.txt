At a dance studio in Sydney's Chinatown, scores of teenagers are taking their shot at fame.These young hopefuls are not aiming for Hollywood or New York, their eyes are on Seoul, South Korea, where K-Pop — short for Korean Pop — is in hot demand.Alongside the music executives at the auditions is boy band JJCC - the brainchild of action film star Jackie Chan.JJCC has classed themselves as survivors in the K-Pop world — they are now going into their third year in the industry. One of the group's members is Heny Mak — now known as Prince Mak — a young Australian Chinese from south-western Sydney."I'm just a normal Australian Chinese boy and Jackie Chan, he made my dream come true," he told the wannabes at the auditions.But it was not an easy ride to fame."I couldn't speak a word of Korean, I didn't understand their culture, because Korean culture is very different to Chinese culture or Australian culture," he told 7.30."There's a certain language you can only speak to your seniors and to your juniors, you [have to] bow down, so all that was very different for me."Prince Mak said he had not seen his family in four years after becoming entangled in the world of K-Pop."If I knew about [the tough regime] I probably wouldn't have chosen this road, but now it's a bit too late for me," he said. The busy schedules and demanding hours would not change the minds of the hundreds who had turned out to the Sydney auditions with stars in their eyes."I'm a massive K-Pop fan for ... about five years, so when they said there was an audition I was, like, 'yes, sign me up'," one hopeful said."I've been wanting this dream for a long time and this is a really good opportunity," said another.But while hundreds debut each year, not many will survive long in the industry."Every year in the K-Pop industry there is almost 200 groups that debut, not 200 people but 200 groups," Prince Mak said."Each year averages about five members, so that's like a thousand people debut every year."Only maybe only a hundred of them will survive and can go onto next year ... it's a very competitive industry."
