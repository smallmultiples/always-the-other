Leaked US Navy images have captured the dramatic moment a Chinese warship came perilously close to an American destroyer as it conducted a "freedom of navigation" patrol in the South China Sea.The series of pictures first published by the GCaptain blog show the USS Decatur within 40 metres of a People's Liberation Army Navy destroyer on Sunday morning.The Pentagon has accused the Chinese ship of conducting an "unsafe and unprofessional manoeuvre" near USS Decatur as it sailed near Gaven Reefs, which are claimed by Beijing."A [People's Republic of China] Luyang destroyer approached USS Decatur in an unsafe and unprofessional manoeuvre in the vicinity of Gaven Reef in the South China Sea," said Captain Charles Brown, a spokesman for US Pacific Fleet, in a statement.Captain Brown said the Chinese warship, "conducted a series of increasingly aggressive manoeuvres accompanied by warnings for the Decatur to depart the area". In a statement, the Chinese Foreign Ministry described the US as taking "provocative actions" in the South China Sea, arguing it had "indisputable sovereignty over the South China Sea islands and their adjacent waters"."[The US] has, under the pretext of 'navigation and overflight freedom', violated basic norms governing international relations, threatened China's sovereignty and security, and disturbed regional peace and stability," the statement said."China is strongly dissatisfied with and firmly opposed to that."We strongly urge the US side to immediately correct its mistake and stop such provocative actions to avoid undermining China-US relations and regional peace and stability."The Chinese side will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national sovereignty and security."Retired Royal Australian Navy Commodore Richard Menhinick said the photos appear to show the Chinese were not acting in accordance with the International Law of the Sea."My guess is that the Chinese vessel positioned itself ahead of the American Ship and then slowed down," Mr Menhinick told the ABC."It's certainly uncomfortable, it's certainly not what's supposed to happen under the Law of the Sea."The Law of the Sea is designed to have a 'give way' vessel and another vessel, and not to end up in situations like that."In a statement, Defence Minister Christopher Pyne described the reports as "concerning"."We would view any use of intimidation or aggressive tactics as destabilising and potentially dangerous," Mr Pyne said."Australia has consistently expressed concern over ongoing militarisation of the South China Sea and we continue to urge all claimants to refrain from unilateral actions that would increase tension in the region."Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australia would strive to provide a calming influence in the region."Australia will continue to conduct itself around these issues in a very modest, and very constructive way â€¦ in a way that would seek to deescalate any issues, rather than escalate," he told reporters in Perth.Shadow Foreign Minister Penny Wong said Labor supported the Government's stance."We don't want to see escalation, we don't want to see tension in the South China Sea, we certainly don't want to see risky behaviour," Senator Wong said.This article includes interactive enhancements which are not supported on this platform.For the full interactive experience in this article, you will need a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.
