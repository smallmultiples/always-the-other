The Australian ballet has taken to the stage in China for the first time in a decade, giving a new generation of dancers the chance to connect with Chinese audiences.The company opened the six-show tour with a mixed bill at the Beijing Performing Arts Centre, but is also performing two of its most popular classics: Swan Lake and Cinderella.While opening night under the massive glass dome in Beijing went smoothly, performers admitted feeling a little overawed."Beijing is just epic. The theatre is epic, and everything we've seen is just on a massive proportion. So that's a good challenge for us to rise to that level of impressiveness," said Brett Chynoweth, a soloist on his first Chinese tour.As we were doing lifts and jumps they were cheering and taking photos. It was really special to be at such an iconic space and be so generously received. The company is showcasing a mixture of classic and contemporary dance, and hopes Swan Lake, choreographed by Graeme Murphy, will bring a distinctively Australian touch to a much loved narrative.But the dancers are looking beyond the stage to engage audiences.In scenes reminiscent of earlier tours of China, they struck poses on the Great Wall, and courted curious onlookers with an impromptu performance overlooked by Chairman Mao's portrait in Tiananmen Square."It was packed and we were there in costumes and tutus," said Chynoweth."As we were doing lifts and jumps they were cheering and taking photos. It was really special to be at such an iconic space and be so generously received."This year's tour is the eighth time the Australian Ballet has toured China, and it is highlighting the links between the two countries.The youngest principal artist is 25-year-old Guo Chengwu, who joined the Australian ballet in 2008, having grown up in China.He starred in the film Mao's Last Dancer, which portrayed another Australian ballet star of Chinese origin, Li Cunxin."We first toured China in 1980, and of the 37 countries we've been to over the years, we've been here the most," said Libby Christie, the Australian Ballet's executive director."I think it reflects how close the ties are with the arts sector in China, but also the diplomatic and commercial ties. Each time we come back, the links get stronger." Twelve containers of sets, technical gear and costumes were shipped to China for the tour, and aside from dancers and the production team, the touring party of 116 people also includes physiotherapists to keep the dancers in peak shape.
