Troops from Australia, China and the US have weathered Top End elements in a survival exercise aimed at promoting trilateral cooperation.Thirty soldiers and marines were trained by bush survival experts NORFORCE on how to create fire, purify water, navigate using the stars, hunt and even catch a croc for the barbeque.They were then left to fend for themselves in the Daly River region for six days with nothing but a knife. Senior survival skills officer David Sudholz said learning to deal with heat was the number one priority, but very real dangers lurked in nearby water sources."The crocodile threat is real," the NORFORCE instructor said."The first camp that we had the students or participants sited at we identified that there was a large crocodile in that waterway."They [parks and wildlife] managed to trap that animal and it measured 4.3 metres long, so it was a large saltwater crocodile."Warrant Officer Sudholz said the troops were trained to eat whatever they can catch, but the average participant loses eight kilograms in the exercise."We're thrown into a certain situation where we need to use everyone, everyone has a certain skill that they can bring to the table and the Chinese were wonderful at everything they did," Private Melanie O'Sullivan said."And everyone else brought their hunting skills and [kept] the fire lit and then just a rotation of everything; and it all worked really well, everyone just came together."Lieutenant Li Wuhui said the troops survived on hunting skills to trap, kill and cook animals and find insects."We caught five wallabies in a week and we trapped one fish," he said."Crocodile we have a barbeque ... so the instructors cooked crocodile for us so we have the opportunity to taste it." The Chinese and Australian military top brass welcomed the soldiers from the bush after almost three weeks of Exercise Kowari and both said it broke down barriers between soldiers.When asked about tensions in the South China Sea, Major General Zhao Jilu said friendship, cooperation and trust demonstrated in Exercise Kowari might be key in future resolutions, however "clarified" China's position."It's just a joke, we're not going to accept that or recognise that, not now or in the future," Major Zhao said."And I think communication and cooperation is the key to any solutions and issues and problems and I think Exercise Kowari has very positive clues on how we are going to solve any issue and problems in the futures."
