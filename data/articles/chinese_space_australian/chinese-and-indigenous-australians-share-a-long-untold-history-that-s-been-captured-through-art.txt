This year marks 200 years since the first Chinese migrant arrived in Australia back in 1818, yet the historical connections between Chinese and Indigenous people have largely gone unrecorded. However what has been recorded and remembered reveals a longstanding place for Chinese migrants in this country, forged by Aboriginal people in the wake of colonial persecution."I tell people I'm 100 per cent Chinese, 100 per cent Aboriginal, 100 per cent Australian, and most people can't really grapple with that," Jason Wing told the ABC."But that's how I've always felt."Wing is a Sydney-based artist, descended from the Biripi Aboriginal people from the modern Taree region on his mother's side, and hailing from the Canton (Guangdong) province of China on his father's. He was largely raised by his paternal grandfather Stan Wing, a former Australian Army Major born in Sydney to Chinese migrant parents, in a Cabramatta house adorned with Chinese paper cuttings.Wing's artworks such as "ABC" (Aboriginal Born Chinese) reflect how he has combined traditional Chinese artforms with the legacy of his Aboriginal heritage — his maternal grandfather Bill Irving was part of the stolen generation.While Wing saw a rich relationship between Chinese and Indigenous cultures in Australian history, he lamented that this was another part of the nation's untold past."I'm quite blown away that there's not more out there. It's an untold history," he said."You never hear about the success stories of ostracised and demonised cultures surviving in solidarity and triumphing." Mark Wang, Director of the Chinese Museum in Melbourne, said both societies were marginalised and therefore had things in common."There was a lot of intermarriages between Chinese men and other ethnicities, so that's how that relationship between Aboriginal and Chinese people started," he added. Wing and Mr Wang believed this was the beginning of a strong cultural bond between Indigenous and Chinese communities, which they are eager to capture in future artwork and exhibitions.In 1988, Zhou Xiaoping came to Australia for the first time to exhibit his work in Melbourne.Born and raised in China, Zhou spoke little English and had never heard of Indigenous people before his trip to Alice Springs.   In the town, he encountered a people, a culture, and a landscape that has fascinated him to this day, a new muse for a traditional style of brush painting fostered on the other side of the world.He has spent much of the last 30 years living and collaborating with Indigenous communities in Arnhem Land and the Kimberley. From his collaboration with close friend and renowned Aboriginal artist, the late Johnny Bulunbulun, Zhou recalled this fascination was reciprocal. Where Zhou was determined to learn about Indigenous culture to shape and colour his own art, Bulunbulun was himself on a path to understand how he fit in his country."He wanted to know what I'm thinking when I'm painting, how do I think … I know he tried to figure out how I relate to his country, the landscape, the connection," he said. Facilitating that connection to the country for migrants — not just from China but from all over the world — is a focus of Aboriginal actor and activist Uncle Jack Charles.The 74-year-old Bunurong leader said Welcome to Country and cross cultural awareness programs provided by Indigenous communities for migrant groups could create a more inclusive future, and lamented this opportunity was currently lacking."We haven't been empowered like we were originally by Victoria to be at the immigration gate" he said."We need to go back to basics and be at the immigration gate in all our states to give a genuine welcome to country and cross-cultural awareness programs."This country can afford to have many people on our lands, coming into our lands, and we need to be welcoming them to our lands." To that end, Wing said he was critical of lingering colonial attitudes that continued to marginalise Indigenous voices and, in turn, their potential to help integrate new Australians into the country."Our Government really hasn't progressed that far, which is scary if you look at the past to inform the future," he said."Every culture gets demonised until the next culture comes." This sentiment echoes through the ongoing criticism of Zhou's work.From the 1990s to today, he has faced suspicion from white Australians claiming his work is exploitative of Aboriginal art, yet does not recall receiving any such criticism from Aboriginal people.According to The Australian, Zhou was defended by Marcia Langton, Chair of Indigenous Studies at The University of Melbourne.Professor Langton labelled this criticism as the result of problematic conceptions of Aboriginal people lacking autonomy and needing white protectors.Where Chinese and Indigenous Australians share a long and untold history, their future may hold a more central place on the country's stage.As the nation celebrates 200 years from the beginning of Chinese migration, these stories show that a place for these new Australians, not just from China but across Asia, was made long ago by its first inhabitants.
