The Adelaide Festival Centre will bring more Chinese artists and performers to the city as local interest in the country's culture continues to grow. It has signed an agreement with the China Cultural Centre in Sydney to support more exhibitions in Adelaide.The Beijing-backed China Cultural Centre is one of 25 worldwide aiming to foster friendship and promote Chinese culture and art.Festival Centre chief executive Douglas Gautier said the agreement reflected an increasing appetite for performances and artwork from the Asian giant."After English, the second-most spoken language in our country is Mandarin," Mr Gautier said."People are taking a look at China for all sorts of reasons, particularly from a business and political point of view."I think understanding somebody else's culture and what it means just helps all those other things to go along well."Mr Gautier said the agreement meant South Australians would not miss out on Chinese works touring Australia."Things that you're bringing in to Sydney, whether it be exhibitions or performing arts, we'd like to make sure that we have the best of it and we're able to bring those to the centre," he said.While Adelaide enjoys the popular OzAsia festival each September, the China Cultural Centre wanted more events to take place around Chinese New Year. A new exhibition at the Festival Centre, Stories of Life, has just begun showcasing contemporary Chinese artworks.Curated in association with the China Cultural Centre, the exhibition explores life in rapidly changing China, including works from photographer Miao Xiaochun and sculptor Xiang Jing."It's 13 fantastic young Beijing artists working in all sorts of media, watercolours through to 3D, automation and games," Mr Gautier said."It really shows the contemporary directions and variety that is happening in China, and particularly Beijing."The Chinese Music Orchestra is also performing in Adelaide for the first time this month, at the Festival Centre.
