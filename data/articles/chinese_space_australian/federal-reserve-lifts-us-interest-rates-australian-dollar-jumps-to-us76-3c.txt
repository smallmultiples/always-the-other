Despite strong signals that the US economy is on the mend, Wall Street had a mixed day. While the Dow Jones (+0.3pc) closed at a fresh record, the S&P 500 (-0.1pc) fell slightly below its breakeven point.The S&P was dragged down by the financials sector (-1.3pc), which had its worst day since early-November.The Nasdaq traded 0.2 per cent higher, driven by stocks in the healthcare sector (+0.3pc).The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.25 per cent on Thursday morning.This is the third US rate hike this year, with the Federal Funds Rate now at 1.25-1.5 per cent.The Fed projected three more hikes in each of 2018 and 2019 before a long-run level of 2.8 percent is reached — which is unchanged from the last round of forecasts in September."Economic activity has been rising at a solid rate...job gains have been solid," the Fed's policy-setting committee said in a statement.Fed Chair Janet Yellen, in her last press conference before her four-year term ends early next year, pointed to the Trump administration's proposed tax overhaul as the impetus for an upgrade of policymakers' economic growth forecasts.The Fed now sees gross domestic product growing 2.5 per cent in 2018, up from the 2.1 percent forecast in September."Most of my colleagues factored in the prospect of fiscal stimulus, along the lines of what is contemplated by Congress, into their projections," she said.But Dr Yellen said the precise impact of the tax plan, which includes a sharp reduction in corporate income taxes, depended on various factors."While changes in tax policy will likely provide some lift to economic activity in coming years, the magnitude and timing of the macroeconomic effects of any tax package remain uncertain," she said.The US Senate and House of Representatives have made progress with reconciling their competing tax reform bills.Congressional Republicans reached a deal on the final form of the bill, the US Senate's top Republican tax writer said on Wednesday."I think we've got a pretty good deal," Senate Finance Committee chairman Orrin Hatch told reporters.This would see the corporate tax cut would be slashed to 21 per cent — far below the present headline rate of 35 per cent.Further details of the agreed legislation were not yet available, and a final bill could be formally unveiled as soon as Friday.If President Donald Trump can sign the bill before year's end, it would be the first major legislative victory for him and the Republicans since they took control of the White House.The ASX is expected to track Wall Street's solid performance, and open higher today.The Australian dollar is considerably stronger, having risen 1 per cent to 76.33 US cents.This is due to "broad‑based US dollar weakness", said Commonwealth Bank's Elias Haddad.Mr Haddad believes there is room for the local currency to make further gains due to "favourable Australian employment conditions" and "encouraging Chinese November economic activity".According to economists polled by Reuters, 18,000 new jobs will be created in November, the participation rate will remain steady at 65.1 per cent, and unemployment will be unchanged at 5.4 per cent.Also out today is China's latest retail sales, fixed asset investment and industrial production figures.with Reuters
