The Australian Broadcasting Corporation has launched a Chinese registered website, the first mainstream western media organisation to do so.The site — AustraliaPlus.cn — hosts a mix of Australian stories on entertainment, business and travel. It is aimed at a Chinese audience as well as Chinese expats living in Australia.The site comes after ABC International signed a media agreement with its main Chinese media partner, the Shanghai Media Group (SMG), in June last year.The ABC has 16 syndication and co-production partnerships with China's leading television, radio and online organisations including CCTV, Beijing TV, China Daily Online, Tencent QQ, Sina and Youku.The AustraliaPlus site will contain multimedia content in both the Chinese and English languages.It will also provide Chinese people with information on Australia for those wanting to work, study, do business or travel to the country.Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the launch of the site was "yet another important occasion in the Australia, China relationship"."The potential for Australia's relationship with China to grow and prosper has never been greater and the launch is a testament to the high degree of respect for Australia and for the ABC within China," Mr Abbott said.ABC International chief executive Lynley Marshall said the ABC had worked closely with SMG to launch the site."From today Australia has an important new gateway through which to connect to millions of Chinese," Ms Marshall said.  "We now have the ability to engage directly with our Chinese audiences from within China supported by our valued Chinese partners."  Ms Marshall praised Australia's Free Trade Agreement with China which she said laid "the ideal foundation" for the ABC to establish the site.SMG president Wang Jianjun also welcomed the launch. "The ABC and the Shanghai Media Group have been long-term international partners and we have over the past run TV weeks for each other for many years," Ms Wang said."We are making progress on other aspects in our partnership."The AustraliaPlus site will also include content from the ABC's Learn English programs as well as the world premiere of the Bobbie the Bear Live Action series — the lavender bear from Bridestowe Estate, Tasmania that has caused a sensation across China.
