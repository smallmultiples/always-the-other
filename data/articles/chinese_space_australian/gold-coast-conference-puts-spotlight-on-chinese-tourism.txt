The G20 summit is not the only international forum that will be held in south-east Queensland this week.The East-West Dialogue on Tourism and the Chinese Dream will start in Surfers Paradise tomorrow.Professor Noel Scott from the Griffith Tourism Institute said it was an important opportunity to gain insights into a growing market."There's a need to try and make sure that we're providing the experiences that Chinese people are very interested in," he said."I think we're doing a lot of things right but I think there are areas where we can improve as well."Professor Scott said Chinese and Australian government, education and research institute representatives would take part."What we're trying to do is to understand some of the nuances of how Chinese society's developing, how that relates to tourism and therefore how those changes are going to impact on the Gold Coast," he said.
