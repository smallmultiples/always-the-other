There is a shortage of housing in Sydney and Melbourne and plenty of demand - to me this looks less like a "bubble" and more like the market at work, writes Alan Kohler.Now we know why the Reserve Bank is worried about the property market: according to yesterday's board meeting minutes, it's not because banks might get into trouble, but because if prices went up some more, that would increase the potential for them to fall later, and households could cut back spending if their wealth declined.Could. If. Maybe. If house prices go up a lot, they might come down. Well, yes.Have they gone up a lot already? In the words of the RBA Board: "... members considered that the risks associated with this trend warranted ongoing close observation."Well, yes, again.You decide:(Graph source: CBA Economics)Yep, it's all about Sydney; nothing much going on anywhere else, and Sydney's rise of about 30 per cent in two years probably has something to do with what federal MP Kelly O'Dwyer was talking about this week.She told a forum in Sydney that the Foreign Investment Review Board was not properly policing the restriction on foreign investors (read: Chinese) buying existing dwellings:We ... encourage foreign investors to invest in new dwellings because we see that as having a strong benefit for the country, both in terms of supplying new housing but also in terms of the economic output that flows from that.But there are restrictions already in place for non-resident foreign investors wanting to purchase existing dwellings, and some of the evidence to date that has been presented to the committee is that the foreign investment restrictions on those people have simply not been enforced.(Kelly O'Dwyer is heading a joint parliamentary committee considering ways to make it harder for foreigners to buy Australian real estate.)But a large part of the foreign buying of local real estate is not from Chinese citizens flouting the local regulations in the apparently correct belief they won't get caught, but because of "Business Innovation and Investment visas".There are three types of these (to quote the Department of Immigration fact sheet):In other words, you don't need $5m - you just need to be in business or be an investor.And you have to live somewhere: not Mudgee or Mildura, thanks very much, but Sydney or Melbourne, please. They are not 'foreign buyers' after they migrate, and therefore do not fall under FIRB rules.At the same time as it has stopped the boats, the Abbott Government has opened the airports – to business and investment migrants. There is apparently a quiet flood of it.In either case - foreign investors dodging the rules or business migrants and their families buying a home to live in - the flow of Chinese money into Australian real estate, in fact into real estate all over the world, has only just begun.The wave of money out of China, spurred in part by President Xi Jinping's huge crackdown on corruption, could last for decades and raise property prices a lot higher than they are now.And this has nothing to do with interest rates or the Reserve Bank.There are three main effects of rising property prices, two of which are good and one is bad:The reason No.3 is bad, and making everyone so upset about high house prices, is not that real estate is such a great investment (at these prices, it's not!) but because it's one of only two tax-free investments.The other is super, once you're in pension phase.If you think about it, home ownership and superannuation are both, in reality, retirement plans. When most people retire, their two assets are super and their house, and most people cash both of them in.It's true that owning a home is enforced saving, with a very large 'fee' (interest) going to the bank. But rent is less than mortgage repayments, so a household that's renting can theoretically save more in super and therefore lose less to the bank.Of course, the problem is that super only enforces up to 9.5 per cent of salary, and most young families will spend what they have over that if it's not going on a mortgage, probably on education.But then again, they won't have to support their parents, and in fact their parents can probably support them instead, because the houses that are too expensive will fetch a good price for their empty-nest parents when the kids move out and rent.What's more, the wealth effect on consumption and investment of rising house prices will help ensure they all have a job.The point is that it's not entirely clear that expensive housing is a bad thing, although I am talking my book, of course, as a home-owning, empty-nest baby boomer (with frustrated, renting children).It is true that a bubble followed by a crash would be undesirable, to say the least, but is that what we have coming?I doubt it. As a rule of thumb, if everyone thinks it's a bubble, it isn't one. Bubbles occur when everyone is complacent.There is a shortage of housing, especially inner-city, and plenty of demand, augmented by foreign investment, business migrants and SMSFs. It looks to me like the market at work.And the demand from foreign buyers, especially Chinese, has a long way to go.Australian houses, especially in Sydney and Melbourne, could be theoretically overvalued for a very long time.Alan Kohler is finance presenter on ABC News.

Comments for this story are closed.18 Sep 2014 9:16:33amI agree it is the market at work, but it is the market for investments not the market for somewhere to live that is driving it. Until the sacred-cow status is removed from residential real estate, and real estate earnings and capital growth treated exactly the same as from other investments, we will always have this foolish situation. We might even suddenly discover we could invest in our own resources, farming and manufacturing. That'd be a first.

18 Sep 2014 9:48:29amI agree.There is no shortage of housing to live in, there is a shortage of housing for investors.If there was a shortage of housing to live in we would see rents increase to the point where they would pay for the loans that purchased them. As it stands rent will not maintain most loans which makes the market a bubble fed by investors.I own a modest house and have a loan smaller than a car loan so if house prices do drop and investors bankrupt or sell en masse I will be the first in line to capitalise on the cheap housing available at that time.

18 Sep 2014 11:10:59amEarly Grace admitted: "...As it stands rent will not maintain most loans which makes the market a bubble fed by investors."Let me translate that for anybody who is confused. It means that investors are not prepared (or possibly even capable) of paying the capital and interest on the loans they have taken out and expect the financial burden of THEIR profit-making exercise to be met by their prey, the renters, (plus also the cost of maintenance and no doubt a certain profit on top).The adjective that Kohler and most corporatzis  omit when talking of housing and renting is "affordable". If a renter (single or family) in full-time employment (and the agents won't rent to anybody else) isn't being paid enough to service their own housing and living needs, then that property is only going to be leased to another corporatzi and so another worker or family becomes homeless.Well done, the corporate "market". Your greed is going to kill the body on which you feed. But that's just normal parasitic behaviour, isn't it! When each corporate goes bust and leaves the property unoccpied and unmaintained, the squatters will move in and we can see the kinds of neighbourhood that has produced, in London and Detroit.

18 Sep 2014 12:12:35pmActually what I was referring to was the fact that renters can not provide enough income to pay the loans.Without receiving an income that covers the costs of any investment that investment is a speculative investment based on the premise that the profit from resale will be enough to cover the loss while holding that investment.If there were not these speculative investment profits being generated the investment would need to pay for itself and rent would need to be charged at a level that covers costs. Since rents are already higher than many people can afford the pressure on the investor would be to pay less for their investment so as to not make a loss. Investors refusing to pay high prices would lead to less people vying for properties and lower housing prices. Removing negative gearing would start to drive down prices by making investment in property less profitable and reducing the demand.

18 Sep 2014 3:25:59pmEarly Grace repeated: "...Actually what I was referring to was the fact that renters can not provide enough income to pay the loans...."That's a rephrasing of what I said.Employers do not pay high enough wages or salaries to wage-based workers to live AND pay the rents demanded.Renters on corporate Fringe Benefits CAN afford the rents being charged because their companies jack up the price of their goods and services to fund the rent for their salary packaged executives.The problem lies in the greed of the investors (landlords) who expect their renters to pay their investment costs, interest and principal, so that the investors get a free ride.If investors put their hands into their OWN pockets, not the renters, to pay for THEIR properties then the investment market might cool down and there will be fewer families who become homeless because of greedy landlords.

18 Sep 2014 4:09:20pm"Actually what I was referring to was the fact that renters can not provide enough income to pay the loans."But why would anybody reasonably expect renters to provide enough income to pay the loans? They are only renting it, not buying it, so it makes sense that renters don't cover the cost of the loan. If they were, why would they bother renting?

18 Sep 2014 4:21:43pmI find it interesting that so many people don't understand the concept of when an 'investment' is not able to generate a return that it is purely speculative, not investing. Early Grayce hit the nail fairly on the head.A proper investment generates a return (think buying a business or even blue-chip shares) - it does not rely on purely selling it to someone at a higher price than you bought it for to make a profit.This is a huge speculative bubble that we are in, and it won't end well...

18 Sep 2014 1:53:49pmApparently, 55% of the houses in Australia are owned by 22% of the population.  That leaves 45% of houses for about 80% of the population to buy, if they could.  However, paying rent in order to pay off that property for the investor does not help you save for a Loan. The renter also has to live there.  Far too often, a sad and soulless box that the Developer/Investor does not or would not live in themselves.It still costs you about $650 per month for every $100 000 you borrow for a home loan.  So if you could save a $100k deposit it would save you $650 a month.  That is worth it in the long run.  But if 30-40% of your net income is going on rent...'Imagine paying your rent (or mortgage) with cash each month, holding it in your hand.'For a lot of people there is no chance of ever buying a Home in Australia.  That is wrong.

18 Sep 2014 5:05:28pmPedro someone I was talking to today related a conversation he had with a real estate agent today.  He said we are just repeating a cycle - investors rush in paying big prices, anticipating further capital growth.  Market goes quiet, no capital gains in prospect, investor gets tetchy about receiving 3% returns, sells out.  Building activity is picking up I gather.  Renters will get a turn again some time.  Picking the right time to buy will be difficult.

18 Sep 2014 4:35:57pmE.G. - it's amazing how few people grasp the concept that you have alluded to in your post.When someone buys an 'investment' knowing that the income from said investment does not cover the holding/running costs of the investment, then it is speculation by it's pure definition.So-called market experts can't see this Ponzi-scheme unfolding before  us in the Aus property market.

19 Sep 2014 5:25:46amYes I must agree that capital city prices I Sydney and Melbourne  never really crash. But as a person who has lost money investing in real estate I can tell you that other areas do crash outside the big cities. Negative gearing needs to be limited to one property and not used as a tool to reduce ones income . In other words property pimps and the rich must be made to pay the right taxes". If a nation can't put a roof over the heads of its families what good is it? To anyone. Exiting the cities may be one answer but that means our cities will be owned by foreigners and Aussies  will be renters only. More land had to be released and if it's green belt or national park too bad our families must come first.

18 Sep 2014 6:19:05pmBut over a short period of time (in mortgage terms) a house quite easily becomes an actual investment.  That is, it returns more than what is required to service the costs such as mortgage and services etc. OR it does in some areas. I don't really know about sydney. Yes, you need to hang on to that house for some years before this happens (about 5 years in our case). But the repayment for us has stayed constant and inflation has increased the price of rent to a point where it 'pays for itself'. In another 25 to 35 years which will be my approximate retirement age, it will be generating quite an income compared to its loan (which principal must be paid off if you know the law of tax deductibity of interest). I'm not quite sure that some of the nasty, greedy investor types actually exist that are spoken of here, but I'm just a wage earner hoping that I can have a couple of houses paying rent to me by my retirement that I can live off.

19 Sep 2014 4:46:50amI live in a house, in Sydney, that my parents bought in 1954 for about 1500 pounds.At that time, there was no road, not even a dirt road. The last 100 yards to the house from the end of the dirt road was a steep downhill grass track. All the furniture had to be hand-carried.It's changed now, of course. The first Chinese-owned MacMansion was built next door this year.I've never seen the need to "renovate" nor rebuild. Part of the house is weatherboard, part fibro. There's a tin roof, not tile (too heavy for the roof joists).However, it stands on a half-acre of land in Wahroonga and through no effort on my part, as an "asset" it's worth seven figures. It's NOT an "asset", it's my HOME! I live in it, I will probably die in it. That's what homes are for, not "investments", "asset growth", market manipulation  and the constant scramble to one-up the Joneses.

18 Sep 2014 11:22:37amIt is all very interesting that is for sure. The question is what will happen when interest rates go up, will there be a major shake up or just a levelling off.An interesting key to this question is if indeed wages are growing below inflation will people be able to cope a change in rates. The present economic view seems to indicate low, inflation, low growth and low demand (though not for housing). Its out of kilter there needs to be growth in incomes to justify the growth in prices for housing.
Alert moderator
18 Sep 2014 11:46:17amit is an interesting question. I suspect (based on what happened earlier this century) that rates won't have to increase by nearly as much as they did in the late 80's to have a negative impact on borrowers. After all if your highly leveraged and a significant % of your pay goes to servicing your mortgage then even a small rate increase will hurt. As such interest rates in this country won't increase too much.I would also argue that the factor above will keep our dollar above levels that it ordinarily would have fallen to in previous interest rate cycles. If one looks at RBA minutes you can see that the bank has struggled with this problem in the past - they would have loved to have lowered interest rates to reduce the value of our dollar but knew that could/would lead to an overheated housing market.
Alert moderator
18 Sep 2014 3:35:39pmYou would have been much better off buying a house during the 80s high interest rates than now, because it would cost you less as a percentage of income to mortgage.  This is well known.  Interest rates do not have to go up by much currently to cause problems.  The 80s are long gone.

18 Sep 2014 12:17:09pmI do wonder how much of a rates increase it will take to scare investors and when housing price increases start to slow if there is a mass exodus of investors trying to minimise potential losses causing a further downturn in the market.I hope it all comes crashing down as I will be there to make a profit from the ashes.

18 Sep 2014 1:37:40pmI understand that only 30% of homes sold in Melbourne sold for less than $400,000.That says to me there is not the supply of under $400K homes you seem to think there is.Therefore assuming 50% of would be home buyers take your advice and lower their expectations-how long would it be before the prices go up? Is it not a question of supply and demand? Not as simple as you suggest.Also try managing a $200K mortgage on a low income.The answer may lie in allowing people to live in temp. dwellings until they can afford to but build a home- as we did back in the 1950s.

18 Sep 2014 10:52:42amNo need to make claims about "fair" or "unfair", the government is simply missing out on a tax revenue stream that would be efficient and enable other more productive parts of the economy to grow better instead of allowing property investment to eat up so much capital.Negative gearing on existing houses should be removed or at least limited.Stamp duty should be removed and replaced with a broad based land tax that would encourage efficient use of inner city land as well as encouraging economic mobility for people to move to where employment options are.
Alert moderator
18 Sep 2014 12:27:34pmNegative gearing was introduced with the aim of increasing rental stocks for those who can not afford to buy. When it gets in the way of people buying houses it becomes a problem.Negative gearing on greenfields developments only may increase rental stock without affecting people who wish to privately purchase property. It may also increase the amount of new housing to meet the demand of investors which will see negative gearing achieving its intended aim.

18 Sep 2014 11:04:06amPTL In a free market there would be no need for negative gearing. If you fail financially, you fail. thats the free market.Negative gearing is just another measure of 'fairness' afforded by the govt. Make up your mind. Free market, or govt support when it suits you.

18 Sep 2014 11:33:18amIt is a tautology to say that the price is correct because the market has set the price.Fairness is a reasonable metric to apply to policy making and outcomes. Fairness is all about ethics, questions of what is the right thing to do, the right way to allocate resources, and so on. Fairness is why we value the idea of a meritocratic society in which people who are deserving get their just rewards.One view is that fairness is naive, impossible, or impractical (none of which obviate the ethical dimension).But fairness aside, is it a good economic outcome that vast amounts of wealth are tied up in real estate when alternate policies could result in cheaper housing, and more investment in prodcutive capital, and/or other public goods such as education, or R&D, or health?

18 Sep 2014 12:31:17pmThis increase in property prices was entirely predictable.Negative gearing plus people with superannuation looking for a stable investment was always going to see historically high amounts of money invested in real estate.

18 Sep 2014 12:43:16pmIt's not really about you relegating 'fair' to some quaint notion. It's about sensible management based on experience.The 'market' makes huge mistakes but then screams for non-market forces to bail it out. We all have to suffer the consequences - and pay for - the selfish greed of a minority who aren't half as clever as they keep bragging they are.The 'market' is fine for many things, but not for basic human needs such as shelter and food, and fine so long as it plays within its own arena with willing actors who take responsibility for their own actions. When it starts kidnapping unwilling actors to feed on, and weasels out of its own stuff-ups, bawling for others to pay, it's not all fine.

18 Sep 2014 9:19:14amIf there is a housing shorting, then why are rents not extremely high? House price increase has significantly outpaced rents. There are studies showing that in the major cities, numerous properties are left vacant, because more can be made just from capital gains . While more houses do need to be built, the whole 'shortage' crisis is mostly made up. Tax reform is the only long term solution. Its the elephant in the room that all political parties are too afraid to tackle. Plus far too many people and interest groups make far too  much money from the current situation (unearned income).

18 Sep 2014 9:51:59amDarran of Brisbane I do agree with you to degree where investors just buy up and don't rent those houses out. Maybe because of bad tenants trashing those houses could be a deterrent in some cases. Private rental prices have soured due to demand by overseas investors buying up houses and leaving them vacant.The remedy is to cut out this ridiculous Negative Gearing and make those investment portfolios pay their tax the same as anyone else.

18 Sep 2014 3:37:01pmRents ARE extremely high, Darren of Brisbane. Landlords have raised their rents to keep pace with the property market and they don't care that wages have not risen at the same rate.It's all part of the Liberal Party's grand plan to create a peasantry who are economically crippled and a property owning class who do not need to obey any laws. The Irish in the 18thC had a solution to greedy landlords, they burned down the grand houses with the landlords still inside.

18 Sep 2014 4:08:04pmyou are correct Darran,rents have not increased as a proportion of income, which you would expect if the shortage of supply was driving house pricesnor do we have a low number of dwellings per capita, we have a higher number of dwellings per capita than parts of the US where house prices are are lowthe problem that governments face is that it is quite a large minority who are the investor owners, they cant afford to let house prices drop - so have been doing everything possible to prevent any kind of correctionit interesting to see the free market lovers tie themselves in knots explaining why real estate investors should be given special tax breaks

18 Sep 2014 9:26:14amIt must be nice to be able to defend the mechanism that puts housing out of the reach of an increasing number of Australians.Affordable housing, surely, should be one of the priorities of a nation that cares about its populace? Clearly successive governments have shown that this is not the case, and perhaps irreparable damage to community and society continues.
Alert moderator
18 Sep 2014 12:35:11pmMany state governments have had affordable housing schemes that have been neglected for decades. If these schemes had the same amount of stock per capita as they had in the 70s the price of housing would be lower and people on low incomes would have access to affordable housing.Negative gearing was seen as a way to increase rental housing stock and remove the need for public housing but it has backfired spectacularly.

18 Sep 2014 10:55:25amAlfie, no it didn't. That's a myth made up by supporters of negative gearing to support their little cash cow.But if you're sooooo worried about those poor renters, the easy solution would be to phase in the removal of negative gearing or grandfather existing negatively geared property. Then there would be no market shock.I'm sure you're on board with this idea right?
Alert moderator
18 Sep 2014 11:55:12amyour right FF. But what you will see is a drop, or stagnation of, house prices. Same for the share market too (one can negatively gear shares in the same way as real property). And as nearly all of us own shares directly or indirectly (the latter through our super) we should be careful how we kill off negative gearing. I'm not saying it should go, rather if it is to go then a measured windown will mitigate the negative effect of removing negative gearing.
Alert moderator
18 Sep 2014 12:12:13pmAgree FF, enough with the negative gearing myth, it is pure rubbish.There is an Inquiry into Affordable Housing under way with Senate Standing Committees on Economics due to issue its report on 27 November 2014.The issue of negative gearing was well covered by economist Saul Eslake (submission #2). Senator Bob Day submission (#6) is also outstanding.
Alert moderator
18 Sep 2014 1:37:15pmOver 95% of negative gearing is for existing properties so that does not create more rental housing. If you insist on keeping negative gearing then it should only be for new rental properties constructed.I say get rid of negative gearing completely and stop jamming an extra 300,000 people per year into the country so we don't have the constant need to destroy the environment and farmland to build new houses.

18 Sep 2014 10:01:46amMr Kohler makes some interesting points.   I think it very much comes down to how you regard housing.   Is it an investment or is it a home?   Years ago I did a course on investment and one of the points raised that residential realestate was a riskier asset class in relation to other realestate because it had an inbuilt level of irrationality in its pricing.  People will pay more for a house because they like it not for its intrinsic value.   I tend to agree with this.   I look at some of the prices  being asked and think "tell them their dreaming".The point was raised about trading down.   I'm not so sure that this is a valid argument.   One reason is that people don't necessaritly like to move from an area they are familiar with and where their friends are.   The second reason is that trading down might not be that easy.   When I bought my house the idea in the back of my head was that at some time I could release capital by trading down to a unit.   Nowadays unit prices have exploded and in fact I'd have to trade up to get a smaller place.   So, go figure.The third point I'd like to make is in relation to encouraging international investment.  Yesterday I read an article about a foreign investor who had bought a dairy farm with production facilities that could enable immediate access to the export market in his own country.   Because of the high costs of local labour he was looking at bringing in workers from his own country to operate the farm.   In this environment it seems that the foreign investment has no benefit to Australia.  So, why  is the never ending search for offshore money so important?
Alert moderator
18 Sep 2014 12:14:40pm"So, why is the never ending search for offshore money so important?"It is not important for Australians, only for those who would diminish working conditions here.Export jobs, export resources, sell the farm.Politicians have no interest in you or me.

Alert moderator
18 Sep 2014 10:19:55amExactly the sort of article and thinking which led to the GFC. Our dominant school of economics still teaches theories that can't predict or explain crashes and bubbles. Plenty of economists learning from the GFC and adopting new (or old) theories that actually work shame our author is not one of them. If people are buying property based not on the rental income it will provide but purely on the capital gains then it's a bubble. Bubbles can keep going for a long time especially if the government is determined to keep it going with more money and dropping interest rates and tax concessions, Sydneys has been going for a long time and really picking up speed. We need to allow the market to correct and make changes to prevent this sort of thing making housing an unreachable dream for the next generation. Negative gearing has to go. Stamp duty has to go. And we need a land value tax on all propery. All. Then we could have housing that doesn't require two people working for 30 years to pay off and government would have extra revenue so we might be able to have hospitals and schools and other nice things. Or we can just let the cycle continue and give away all that money to people who were rich enough or born at the right time to own land.

18 Sep 2014 10:21:35amStatement; "Bubbles occur when everyone is complacent". True.Implied assumption; This country isn't brimming over with complacency. False (in my view).A few examples from where I sit;1) Un- and underemployment are creeping up, and I see no logical, national economic development that will arrest this trend.2) The mood in this country isn't what I'd call buoyant, and what you could describe as 'the snarl factor' is at levels I've never experienced before.3) Young people seem to be realising in ever increasing numbers that the 'best years of their lives' actually happened before they started having lives.4) Whilst I'm not of the 'debt and deficit catastrophe' mindset regarding the dollar levels of federal AND (often neglected) state finances, what I can't see is any conceivable way (given the aversion to the revenue side of the equation) as to how this changes.5) The industry and employment base upon which this country pays its way is contracting.6) No major political entity ever likely to be the government has the intellectual wherewithal and/or courage to face the situation honestly, preferring instead to frig around at the margins with silly stunts and hollow rhetoric.7) When America kicks off again the money underpinning this ramshackle fiasco goes with it. As a way of crashing the system and coming back later to scoop up some fire sale bargains I couldn't think of a more likelier scenario.8) In case anyone has forgotten it in all the current excitement and diversion, a first term, first year budget doesn't have the support to be implemented (regardless of what you think about it) - nothing I see in opinion polling suggests to me future years will produce a parliamentary arrangement more amenable to de-roadblocking.I'm sure others could add many more examples into the mix. Whereas I appreciate Alan Kohler has a job to do by not spooking the horses, I'm afraid it all looks like wind to me.

18 Sep 2014 10:48:27amThe 'market is working' if your dimension is people with enough money, and sellers willing to sell. How could it be something different? But there's an unintended consequence: the shutting out of young people from the housing market, relegating them to lives as renters. This is a new, and undesirable change in Australia, which you can guarantee voters don't like if any party can get itself organised enough to reflect their views. That the FIRB never enforced the rules, despite the inevitable community fury about this kind of thing is another example of public servants doing the least possible - that's their natural inclination, and the reason we have ministers to gee them up. This ridiculous immigration scheme should be shut down immediately, or at least until government's tie it directly to increased infrastructure spending. At the moment, business gets all the benefits (don't have to train staff, just get 457's), investment capital etc and the rest of society pays the costs (strained services, traffic jams and higher house prices). Negative gearing doesn't help either - it's rent-seeking for the wrong kind of people - subsidies by the taxpayer are not supposed to be for wealthy 2nd home buyers.
Alert moderator
18 Sep 2014 10:51:00amNice try Alan, but you dance around the fundamental issues too much without landing a decent hit, those being:i.   Interest rates being at historical lows.   In the course of a 25-30 year mortgage there is the likelihood we'll return to higher rates.  Anyone able to handle double-digit rates of repayment?ii.  Slowing of capital gains.   Investors have banked on capital gains above rents, which incidentally have risen well and above wages.  If as you propose we remain in high price territory but with little further gain, the investor fervour may become somewhat limp.iii. Exchange rates.    If you're a foreign investor now having bought at a time when the AUSD has enjoyed near-parity with the USD, then a fall to more favoured trading rates of mid-eighty cents will represent a haircut.   As our banks also source much of our credit overseas, they will have to take a profit cut or raise rates in this case.iv. Borrowings v. Disposable Income.   Household debt is is over $1 Trillion, a far greater risk now than the government debt and one that receives precious little discussion.   House price increases of this generation have depended on a glut of credit not limited to household earnings as much as previous generations.   This can and is translating to restraints on future consumption by consumers.v.  Caveat Emptor.   The house value an owner anticipates does not mean anything till the money lands in their pockets.   Property owner wins on price rises have to be moderated with cases of price drops in other sales, and the increasing length of time much stock spends on the market before sale, even so far as to be removed after lack of interest.Bam! Kapow! Smash! Batman could strut this topic out better, Alan.

18 Sep 2014 11:38:00amClearly there is a shortage of housing in this country. Governments should do more to fix that problem as it is one of the reasons young people are priced out of the market. But it is also quite clear that investors are pushing prices up too - if I recall correctly the percentage of investors who are purchasing private dwellings reached record levels recently. Now those investors are encouraged (and significantly so) by the very favourable tax treatment of their investment. That will have an impact on house prices. Alan should be aware of that.

It also results in more money spent on roads in the futile quest to alleviate traffic congestion for an ever increasing number of cars.The major parties are addicted to a cancerous growth as the only way to run the economy. It will make the general public stressed out and eventually kill the host as all viable farmland and park land is built on (if it hasn't been poisoned and destroyed by fracking or mining already). If there was a static population then houses would not have outstripped inflation rates by exponential amounts.

You forgot to add corrupt politicians colluding with greey developers releasing limited amounts of land  to artificially drive the price higher to aid their own back pocket.Even worse in the bush.Good luck trying to buy land over 4.6 ha! Bank wants a 50%+ deposit, RFS madates building within 200 m of a council maintained road. My local council says no building within 250 m of an unsealed road. Work that one out!  Land greater than 46 ha "can't possibly be anything but an agricultural enterprise" so the interest rate rises again.A lot of rural land advertised will say something like "Several home sites with magnificent views", but the land doesn't have a building entitlement! I am absolutelyy bewildered as to why we, as a nation of Australians, have allowed ourselves to be shafted in almost every aspect of our daily lives, and quite frankly I'm over it!

18 Sep 2014 2:43:12pmI normally find Alan quite reasonable but what is he smoking with his "three points"? The first two he lists are *not* good things.Firstly, the wealth effect is bogus when applied to single property owner occupiers. You have to live somewhere so that wealth is not accessible and you are not advantaged by the price of your home being high. In fact, it implies that you have to spend a larger amount of your disposable income over many years paying for it, reducing your possible consumption. For owner occupiers and renters, lower house prices are *always better*.As a retirement plan, high house prices are also fairly useless in the long term. While a fully invested person will be advantaged by house prices rising faster than everything else the advantage is limited to the scope, which can't possibly last forever. A much more sustainable system would be low house prices (affodable for retirees) and people invested in productive enterprises instead of overblown fixed asset prices. The hysteria surrounding the mere possiblity of price reductions should tell you how bad an idea it is for so many people to be heavily invested in one asset sector.

18 Sep 2014 3:06:54pmThanks for the article Alan.I've often reflected on the utterances by that Economist magazine editor (deputy editor?) about our housing market when she was out here in about 2009 and I still think she is correct.  She's referring to the historic trends that look so striking on the kinds of graphs we love you for Mr Kohler.  I try to look at the big picture and I'm sure her advice was correct in that context - when averages prices are a certain multiple of average earnings, trouble is almost certain.  I wish you'd done a 100 year graph of that!  We're only different in that we've got the benefit of OS demand that allows us an additional economic lever that we can turn on and off like a tap.  Aside from that, I am seeing mainly down-sides:* Our focus on globalisation means that our economy is steadily loosing diversity.  One or two shocks and I think a lot of people will be feeling like they're holding a ridiculously expensive baby.* The less healthy boomers will probably starting leaving us in significant numbers soon.  The healthiest will be largely gone in 20 years.  During that 20 year block, my suspicion in that the cost of supporting them is underestimated, along with their impact on the housing market.* The previous government did a lot to prop up confidence and I think their efforts were under-valued.  I don't think the current government understand this and I suspect we'll be more susceptible to trouble under them when problems inevitably arise.* Aside from bankers, the only people who benefit when a population is mortgaged to the gunwales are conservative governments, who know that people tend to be more conservative when they're deep in hock.  But they and their main supporters make up a tiny fraction of the populace.  We're all at much greater risk with this much debt and we're heavily constrained in what we can do to respond to external shocks.  We now only need a relatively minor pandemic or relatively minor energy shock, given how indebted all the major governments are.  And we've got people running around who know this.Those are my ramblings, while The Economist is talking about the kinds of trends that are probably only ever defied for a while.  Regardless of the truth of what you're saying, I think we've got a serious problem here for which a gradual (multiple decade) deflation is the only good solution.

18 Sep 2014 3:40:22pmAll this talk about property, investment, negative gearing etc. Completely overshadowed by the fact that many don't have a living wage to even consider dipping a toe into that market.

18 Sep 2014 3:42:49pmI think you hit the nail on the head when you said.......although I am talking my book, of course, as a home-owning, empty-nest baby boomer (with frustrated, renting children).You see, the "renting children" are finding it rather tough at the moment.  Not only do we have HECS and compulsory superannuation but raising a family is a nightmare.  And after all, isn't that what housing is really for?Jacking up competition for the local tax paying constituents isn't fair or equitable. And no, not everyone's parents are leaving an inheritance for their kids!

18 Sep 2014 3:52:13pmAfter the multiple floods and then carnage and near annihilation of North Bundaberg in recent times, real estate in North Bundaberg increased in value and continues to march higher .. that is normal market forces at work?!! .. yeah right .. move along move along ..

18 Sep 2014 5:43:57pmThe bubble is close to popping it's been a while since it was blown up by real estate agents and greedy people and with us retiring and expecting our little superannuation's to save our butts we are sunk.  Sunk by this stupid government and our own greed.

18 Sep 2014 6:02:05pmIt is my understanding that Melbourne house prices have doubled - on average - every seven years for the past 50 years. That is not a bubble, it's a trend, and European economists have got it wrong at least for the past 10 years - they face a different market.

18 Sep 2014 6:55:46pmBut will the trend continue?   The trends all come to an end or have anomalies, which is what makes the future interesting.

18 Sep 2014 6:53:44pmI am surprised at how many properties are vacant.   How often do you see business premises vacant for years? Perhaps the properties don't have to do anything but increase in value.    Rental returns don't match the investment required so the only reason to buy for investment  is for capital gain.   What a stupid country to think this actually helps wealth - it is not production.  Increased property prices just adds upwards pressure on costs.  Interest rates need to rise - the idea we can build a better future by revaluing (due to cheap loans) is not going to end well.  The debt problem has not disappeared - it continues to grow and will blind side our experts again.

18 Sep 2014 9:33:09pmTo Chinese buyers, add Indians. Having visited these two polluted, overpopulated hell holes over the past two years, it's not difficult to see why the 'new rich' in these countries are looking for an out. Where better than clean, democratic, underpopulated (my opinion) Australia. And the trend will continue. Alan was probably too polite to say why. The so called bubble will be sustained by immigration of wealthy Chinese and Indians. Unless the government succumb to pressure to limit overseas ownership of houses, which they won't because these people bring a lot of wealth into the country.

19 Sep 2014 10:30:35amI've lost a bit of respect for Alan Kohler over this article. I don't think he is a deep economic thinker. Is there truly a 'market' in real estate when there have been so many interventions and distortions from successive governments? And is housing/shelter/home/ psychological safe harbour to be thought of as a commodity in the way that a new pair of sneakers is? I can't think of how housing policy in Australia could be worse. It is robbing younger generations of a base to build their dreams. The boomers have kicked out the ladder on housing, much like they have done with everything else. I've given up. I've decided the hobo life isn't so bad after all. People really should be marching in the street for their right to access good quality, affordable, energy efficient housing.
