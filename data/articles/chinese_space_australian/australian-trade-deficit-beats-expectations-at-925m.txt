Australia's trade deficit has come in better than forecast at $925 million, on a surge in LNG exports.November's deficit was 5 per cent ($48 million) higher than October's (which itself was revised to be $877 million, down from $1.3 billion), but economists surveyed by Bloomberg were typically expecting it to blow out to $1.6 billion.The better-than-expected result saw the Australian dollar continue bouncing off yesterday's five-and-a-half-year lows, and it was trading at 81.35 US cents at 2:40pm (AEDT).Imports were up 0.7 per cent, while exports rose 0.6 per cent which was the area that caught most economists off guard.The biggest export boost came from "other mineral fuels", the category dominated by liquefied natural gas, which rose 21 per cent, or $529 million.Machinery exports were also up 13 per cent.However, the value of metals sold was down $110 million, or 10 per cent, while the dominant metals ores and minerals category slipped 1 per cent, or $101 million.However, Westpac's economists argued that the fall in this segment should have been much bigger."The ABS estimates that the unit value of iron ore fines rose 37 per cent in the month and the unit values of fines to China rose 43 per cent. Silly us for thinking that falling spot and contract prices would mean lower Australian exports (something that was backed up by falling iron ore prices in the Chinese import data)," Westpac's Justin Smirk noted wryly."So stand clear of this number â€“ like the wild Labour Force numbers seen in late 2014, if a data release looks wildly off rational expectations, it is most likely wrong and will be revised."TD Securities agreed that the data looks shaky."We can't help but feel though that the surge in exports to China have picked up due to preliminary iron ore figures from the ABS that appear inflated," said analyst Prashant Newnaha.
