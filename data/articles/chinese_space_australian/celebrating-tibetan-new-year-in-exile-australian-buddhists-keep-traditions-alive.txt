Four-year-old Lhakyi eats sweetened rice by hand, as her mum Kyinzom Dhongdue removes momos (Tibetan dumplings) from a pot in the kitchen.It's Losar, Tibetan New Year, and the Sydney-based family is celebrating with traditions from their homeland — even though neither mother nor daughter was born in Tibet.In the living room, a Buddhist altar has been crafted for the occasion.Upon it sits a statue of Buddha, a framed picture of the Dalai Lama and a selection of offerings, ranging from fresh fruits and flowers, to beer, roasted barley and butter.For Kyinzom, who identifies as a "Tibetan in exile", Losar is a poignant time of year. "The whole idea of making these offerings to the deities and to the Buddha and to our spiritual teacher is to invoke blessings for the family, for our friends, for our community," she says."In Tibetan Buddhism, we believe our suffering and negativity is a result of ignorance, hatred and ego, so it's letting go of all that negativity and bringing in the new year with good energy." But despite the "clean slate" sensation that comes with a new year, Kyinzom notes the occasion is tinged with a sense of longing."This year, we have celebrated a Losar in exile, but next year we hope to celebrate back in Tibet," she says."Every new year, when we make our offerings, this is very much a part of our prayer." This February, Losar is sweetened by the presence of a family member.Kyinzom's dad Tenzin Paljor has flown in from India — his adopted country for 60 years — and he's more than happy to chase his energetic granddaughter around the backyard."My parents were part of the first wave of Tibetan refugees who escaped to India after the uprising as a result of the Chinese occupation in our homeland in the 1950s," says Kyinzom."They moved to India and lived as refugees all their lives."The sense of displacement was passed down to Kyinzom, who grew up in India and moved to Australia in 2006.Today, Kyinzom is an executive officer of the Australia Tibet Council, a national organisation campaigning for the freedom and human rights of Tibetans. She's also a member of the Parliament of the Central Tibetan Administration, known colloquially as the Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile. Politics aside, Kyinzom is committed to ensuring that second- and third-generation Tibetans remain connected to their roots. "In Sydney, we have a Tibetan language school which is run by volunteers," she says."Young kids from the age of five until about 15 go to the Saturday language school, then in the afternoon they learn [Tibetan] song, dance and music.""I take great pride and great joy in ensuring these traditions are alive, especially when I have a young daughter."When it comes to Tibetan Buddhism, it's not just members of the Tibetan diaspora who are spreading the word.Geoffrey Samuel, emeritus professor at Cardiff University's school of religious and theological studies, says Tibetan Buddhism has a long history in Australia, going back to the late 50s and early 60s."[At that time] there were already young Australians who were travelling around India who connected up with the Tibetans and some of those linkages led to Tibetan lamas coming out to Australia," he says."Tibetan Dharma centres in Australia have been around for more than 40 years." Professor Samuel says Australia's Tibetan Buddhist community now has "a distinctly middle-aged class" of followers."Somehow Tibetan Buddhism has become seen as scientific and rational in a way that other religions are not," he says.Kyinzom isn't surprised by the popularity of Tibetan Buddhism among Westerners."What Tibetan culture and Buddhism talks about fundamentally is about interconnectedness: we are all dependent upon one another; we are dependent on the earth," she says."That is the message, I think, that really resonates universally."We might be black, white, brown, of different skin colours, but fundamentally we all want happiness and we do not want suffering."
