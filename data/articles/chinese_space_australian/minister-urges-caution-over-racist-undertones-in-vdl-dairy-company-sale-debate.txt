There are concerns the calls for political intervention in the sale of the largest and oldest dairy farm in Australia to a Chinese company have racist undertones.Businesswoman Jan Cameron plans to underwrite a rival bid for Tasmanian dairy giant Van Diemen's Land (VDL) Company, in an attempt to put the business into Australian hands.Chinese businessman Lu Xianfeng's company, Moon Lake Investments, has made a $280 million binding offer to buy the dairy company from its New Zealand owners, but the sale is still subject to approval from the Foreign Investment Review Board.The board's decision is expected this month.Ms Cameron founded outdoor chain Kathmandu and has had several business interests in Tasmania, including taking over the Chickenfeed discount store which later folded, and the Triabunna Woodchip mill development.  The philanthropist, environmentalist and animal rights supporter is Australia's fourth richest woman and runs business interests in Australia, Britain and New Zealand.She is relying on Federal crossbenchers, including independent MP Andrew Wilkie, and senators Nick Xenophon, Jacqui Lambie and John Madigan, to lobby Treasurer Scott Morrison to veto the sale to Moon Lake.VDL has been foreign owned since it was established on a royal land grant 190 years ago.The company milks 17,890 cows over 7,062 hectares and has Tasmanian approval to expand operations by clearing more than 1,800 hectares of native vegetation.But criticisms have emerged about the political involvement of some people in the company's commercial decision.Tasmanian MP Rene Hidding said he worried about racist undertones at play."I always worry about that," he said."For elected members to be naming up a group of citizens from some part of the world that they're not worthy of owning our real estate is a very dangerous area to go."If I'm ever asked by other members of parliament as to how it ought to be handled, I always advise extreme caution."He said there are already safeguards in place."We're a civilised nation and we have processes in place, it's not always appropriate for people from other countries to buy our companies or our real estate," he said."And for that reason we have a robust Federal process, and frankly those two individuals [Ms Lambie and Mr Wilkie] should be leaving it to that process."Independent MP Andrew Wilkie rejected the claim.He said the issue was not keeping VDL out of Chinese hands, but about putting it in Australian hands."The issue here is that we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Australians to hold a strategic asset and the government should seize that opportunity to ensure that that occurs," he said. "In regard to [Mr Hidding's] comment that politicians shouldn't be weighing into the debate, well that's just plain wrong."Politicians represent their constituents and my constituents are telling me in overwhelming numbers that they want strategic assets like the Van Diemen's Land Company to be held by Australians."Online there has been push back against the plan to stop the company's sale to a Chinese company, given that it has always been foreign owned. "Shameless Xenophobia from @WilkieMP and @JacquiLambie," Olivia Orpington said.Mark asked: "How does the owner of this farm effect [sic] Tasmanians? No-one cared when the kiwis owned it?"El Kez said: "'Yellow peril' gets you votes.""Odd: political support for a Khatmandu [sic] founder to keep out Chinese?!" Oz Battler said.
