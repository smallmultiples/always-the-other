The proponents of a $3 billion casino resort on the Gold Coast have acknowledged that the Chinese Government could be a part owner. "That is not out of the realm of possibility," ASF Group director Louis Chien told 7.30."There are no rules or guidelines that say state-owned enterprises cannot have equity stakes in these type of projects."The Queensland Government is the middle of a community consultation phase to see whether the planned five-tower resort and casino complex on crown land should proceed to the next step.  Critics say the consultation is flawed, because there are too few details."The current public consultation lacks any real rigour," said Doug Flockhart from Clubs Queensland."How can you comment on something when you don't really know what you're commenting on?"The ASF consortium released a concept plan last December, which included entertainment venues, theatres, hotels and residential apartments as well as a casino.But there are no details on the number of poker machines, the casino operator or financial backers.Furthermore, the lead company in consortium, the ASF Group, has a history of auditors expressing doubts about its financial viability going back to 2013."It only has $6 million dollars in net assets," said Judy Spence, vice president of Save Our Broadwater and a former minister in the Beattie Labor state government."Yet it's pretending it can build a $3 billion resort."So, quite honestly, we haven't had a lot of honesty in this debate so far." Mr Chien said such criticism was unfair and misleading."In essence, we're an investment incubator," he explained."We don't manage a big balance sheet because we don't need to ... we call on funding when we need it from outside the company."Although he said discussions with equity partners were commercial-in-confidence, Mr Chien raised the possibility of the Chinese Government-owned China State Construction Engineering Corporation being included."I would say this is something the [Queensland] State [Government] and us have to work through," he said.Gambling is illegal in China, and there's no precedent for Chinese Government investment in Australian casinos, although ASF says there are precedents in Macau and the Bahamas."There's no rule out there that they can't participate," Mr Chien said. Queensland State Development minister Anthony Lynham has defended the decision to consult the community about the project without any detailed proposal."This current community consultation is critical to understanding community views before proceeding," he said in a statement to 7.30."It will assist the Government to decide on its next steps."The minister refused to say whether he was aware of auditors questioning ASF's finance prior to his August 2015 decision to allow the Gold Coast casino resort process to continue.Read Dr Lynham's full response here:
