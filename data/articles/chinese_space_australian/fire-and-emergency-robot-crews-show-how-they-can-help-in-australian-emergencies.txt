Alongside vintage fire engines, remote controlled robots have been showing how the latest technology in fire and rescue can help save lives.At the recent Australasian Fire and Emergency Council annual convention (AFAC) held in Perth, emergency robots were front and centre.While the robots couldn't show the full range of their skills (lighting fires is not allowed inside the Perth Convention Centre) the firefighting and scouting robot manufactured by Chinese company Citic was able to navigate a pile of fallen logs with ease. Edward Wang, from the robot's Australian distributor Engytech, said the robot was not intended to replace human firefighters, but to get into places where it's not safe for humans. "In 2015 in the port of Tianjin, which is very close to Beijing, had a chemical explosion," Mr Wang said."In the explosion a lot of the firefighters and the emergency crew went into the unknown and with equipment that wasn't able to deal with the situation." One hundred and seventy-five people died in the Tianjin chemical explosions, and more than 900 were injured. "This platform was created straight after the incident because it was a national, so that instances like that will never happen again," he said.The robot weighs 520 kilograms, runs on a battery and looks like a small tank, with rubber track wheels, a hose instead of a gun and a camera mounted on the top for the operator to see. "It is a very simple platform to operate, kind of like a remote control car."Mr Wang said the rubber tracks have integrated metal inside to help stability."The rubber is graded to last to 400C, most of our bushfires and chemicals fires would go up to 800C and above," he said."So when that is melted the inside integrated metal will support the whole chassis and the structure, and it will be able to keep on going."There is also a water curtain fitted and with detection of certain temperatures will be able to be used to cool down the robot itself." About 1,000 of the robots are already deployed around China.The robots have yet to be introduced into the Australian firefighting arsenal, but the distributors are keen to see it used in action."When you look at bushfires or factories with chemicals, it is very difficult for humans to be able to go into those environments and obviously when we come to getting rid of the fire we want to not have any fatalities," Mr Wang said."This little robot will be able to go into that environment and be able to tackle the situation."Also rolling around the exhibition hall were remote control demolition robots, operated with great enjoyment by Vince Greco from Husqvarna construction products."It's very simple, as long as you can play Play Station, it's easy and fun too," Mr Greco said. The small crane-like robot, which has wheels and hydraulically operated 'feet' the stand up on, is uses its claw to snap pieces of steel. It's been designed for use building collapses and earthquakes."If a building was perhaps in danger of collapsing due to an earthquake you can send the robot in, clear rubble, break stuff out of the way, cut steel if you have to, and make a pathway for the rescue guys to come in," he said."If the whole building collapses on the robot, depending on how much damage it does, it can be driven back out â€” it will dig its way out." Although not used in Australia, four of the robots are in use at Japan's Fukushima nuclear plants, helping to clean up in places where radiation means humans can't go in. "The beauty about it is the safety, you don't have a human sitting on the machine," Mr Greco said.
