A Sydney man on trial in China charged with drug smuggling has told a court in Guangzhou he thought the bags he was instructed to travel with contained peptides.Peter Gardner, who holds both Australian and New Zealand citizenship, was arrested at Guangzhou International Airport last November, as he waited to board a flight home to Sydney.Chinese customs found 30 kilograms of crystal methamphetamine in two bags that he had checked in together with his Australian travel partner Kalynda Davis.Authorities had to pry open the bags because the zippers were sealed with superglue.Gardner, 25, told the court in Guangzhou that he thought the luggage contained $13,000 worth of peptides, which would have been much more expensive if bought in Australia.He told the court it was all arranged by a well-known friend in Sydney, who had the bags delivered to Gardner at a luxury hotel in Guangzhou.He said he was instructed to take a China Southern airline flight to Sydney as baggage handlers in Sydney would be ready to intercept the luggage.Gardner potentially faces the death penalty in China if found guilty. He expressed remorse during the trial, for what he described as his own "stupidity".The prosecution questioned Gardner's actions, asking why he had travelled from Australia to China to collect thousands of dollars worth of goods he did not even inspect before travel.Two family members and a New Zealand diplomat were present at the hearing.New Zealand consular officials have been providing Gardner with assistance, indicating he entered the country with his New Zealand passport.His travel partner, Ms Davis, was allowed to return to Sydney after being detained for several weeks, because authorities said she had no knowledge of the case. Gardner confirmed to the court in Guangzhou that Ms Davis knew nothing.The trial lasted just one day, but the timeframe for a verdict and sentence is unclear. Gardner's Chinese lawyer Zhang Jie said outside the court that "sometimes it can be pretty long, sometimes it can be a couple of months" for a verdict to be handed down by the judge.Guangzhou is the capital of Guangdong province, which is notorious for being the meth manufacturing hub of China.Chinese law states anyone caught with 50 grams or more of heroin or methamphetamine is liable for capital punishment.Gardner is one of several Australians detained in China on drug-related offences.Adelaide jockey Anthony Bannister is awaiting a verdict after his trial last October.
