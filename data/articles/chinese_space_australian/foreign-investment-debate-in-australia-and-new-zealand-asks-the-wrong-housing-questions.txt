Now that a bill has passed in New Zealand limiting individual foreign real estate investment to new housing construction, the question is will it address the country's housing affordability problem?It is perhaps the wrong question to ask about the foreign investment debate in New Zealand â€” and in Australia.I've been wading through the NZ Government Hansards of the Overseas Investment Amendment debates.  In December last year, Willow-Jean Prime (Labour) said: "The Kiwi Dream of homeownership is slipping away".Kieran McAnulty (Labour) went further by linked the debate to citizenship rights: "This bill recognises and reaffirms that [it] is a birthright of New Zealanders to be able to afford a home".By the third reading of bill, Mark Patterson (NZ First) was returning to some old debates indeed: "Owning your own home is the foundation of this society. Sir Keith Holyoake, the great National Party prime minister, used to talk about New Zealand being a property-owning democracy."Home ownership and birth rights are strong themes in Australian Hansards and reports too. The 2014 Parliamentary Inquiry Report on Foreign Investment in Residential Real Estate opens with: "Owning your own home is part of the great Australian Dream."It's a political slogan that traces back into the 19th century, with claims in Australia in 1886 that it was "the duty of every man to have a home of his own. The home is the foundation of the nation".The great housing dreams or the idea that buying a house is a civic duty were central to the settler society nation-building projects of the 19th and 20th centuries.So was immigration. Indeed, foreign nationals were encouraged to come to Australia and New Zealand, and to buy a house.Many Chinese and other non-white people were formally restricted from settling in Australia by laws such as the White Australia Policy. The connection between foreign migration to Australia and land speculation traces back to the first few decades of settlement in Sydney. Arguably, the first land speculation measure appears only a handful of decades after the arrival of the first settlers in 1788.In 1812 in Sydney, Governor Macquarie inserted a clause into each colonial land grant that forbade the resale of the granted land for a period of five years.Stephen Roberts writes in 1924, Macquarie "had found as very prevalent practice 'the obtaining grants for the sole purpose of selling them'".By 1898 George Sutherland was writing about land and housing booms and bust that had "taken place repeatedly from the very earliest colonial days".The issue, then, is not so much, as Jenny Sales, Associate Minister of Housing and Urban Development in New Zealand put it, "to ensure that our housing market here in Aotearoa, New Zealand is shaped primarily by New Zealanders".Rather, we might ask if Australia's and New Zealand's housing markets have ever been primarily shaped by a stable national population of rights-bearing citizens.The current debate about foreign investment is littered with assumptions about Australia's and New Zealand's housing markets being isolated from the global economy and migration flows.Or that the housing market can be insulated from global sources of finance, or new middle class and super-rich money.Or that the national borders are rigid and secure, with the respective national populations already fully formed and uncontested. Debate about the Trans-Pacific Partnership in New Zealand shows that global finance and business relationships are already shaping the foreign real estate investment landscape.Australians and Singaporeans will be excluded from the Overseas Investment Amendment to protect existing trade agreements.Australia's population is set to grow from 23.3 million in 2018 to 37.6 million by 2050. The global sources of foreign money accompanying these new migrants will contribute to the local housing markets.We need a new discussion about housing affordability, home ownership and foreign money.The old narrative about the dream of homeownership and the duty of every citizen to own a home is a story from another time. It's a story that was built on the back of the colonial project and discriminatory policy.The problem with the housing system today will not be addressed by the restriction of foreign investors, although that is a debate we should have. The problem is the housing system itself.The problem is the property-owning democracies that were built by the foreigners of the past are turning against us.
