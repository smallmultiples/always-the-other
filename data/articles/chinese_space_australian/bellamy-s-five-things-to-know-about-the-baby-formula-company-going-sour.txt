Baby formula maker Bellamy's has gone sour, entering into a trading halt today to try to end a horror sell-off sparked by fears that weaker-than-expected sales in China could get worse.In the last financial year it was one of the ASX's fastest-growing companies, with its share price up 133 per cent and profit up 322 per cent, but a shock update to investors wiped half a billion dollars from the company's share price in minutes.So is the dream over for Bellamy's and what's the deal with China?On December 2, Bellamy's came out with a truth bomb to investors: China sales aren't going as well as hoped and there are some big regulatory hurdles on the near horizon.Bellamy's warned that changes to China's food import rules had led to stockpiles of its product and demand was not meeting forecasts.The news had analysts slashing earnings forecasts, stunning investors, who promptly dumped the stock — it lost 43 per cent that day to end at $6.85. It has since fallen further, closing at $6.68 before going into the trading halt on Monday.The news came two months after the company's annual general meeting, where it now appears that Bellamy's may have glossed over the headwinds coming from China.At the October meeting, the success of Bellamy's in China was heralded with "revenues up 331 per cent" and regulatory changes were portrayed as "long-term growth opportunities", with chief executive Laura McBain informing investors that the company had been planning for the changes "for two years".But the December 2 update reveals it could be much more than that and the trading update expected on Wednesday will hopefully bring more information to the table for investors.The whole episode has meant a big loss of credibility for Bellamy's management, particularly the chief executive.Ms McBain was already under fire from investors, who voted down her $1,380,000 pay packet at the AGM, scoring the company its first strike.It was also not a good look when Ms McBain and chairman Rob Woolley sold some of their Bellamy shares in August shortly after the company's share price hit an eight-month high, netting them $2.4 million and $2.92 million respectively.There are serious questions about who knew what when. In response to an ASX enquiry over the update of December 2, Bellamy's management says it only became aware of the material impact of the slow November sales that morning.Corporate governance expert Professor Stephen Taylor says that is unlikely."The nature of the disclosures that have been made are difficult to reconcile with the absence of any seismic event that could have caused a sudden disruption to sales patterns — it is something that would have developed over time," he says."The sale of shares by board members months earlier is obviously a red flag as well, given the catastrophic drop in the share price [since then]." It is unlikely that this would be the end of Bellamy's, more like the end of its darling status. Nearly three quarters of Bellamy's revenue comes from sales in Australia, which should in theory not be at risk from changing Chinese tastes and regulatory changes.However, a proportion of those sales are to customers who send it overseas at a mark-up.Bellamy's strategy for growth was further penetration into China and South-East Asia. Growth in China was running at 24 per cent a year versus low single-digit growth within Australia.What's worrying for investors is that if the Chinese strategy is at risk, then the company's entire business model is looking a lot less appetising.The share price is expected to take another battering on Wednesday when the company is expected to come out of its trading halt with the release of another update. "The fact they are releasing a full review of operations means they will have found weaknesses and I expect a negative reaction on the market. How low it will go will depend on how far off renewed estimates they are," Professor Taylor says.Bellamy's is not the only company which has found favour by capitalising on Chinese hunger for Australian health products.A2 milk is perhaps the company whose business model most closely resembles Bellamy's.While Bellamy's point of difference is being organic, A2's point of difference is that its milk products only contain A2 protein, which it claims means less tummy discomfort for consumers. CLSA investment analyst Shaun Weick says A2 Milk is still a buy because of its formula's strong performance in China, which "reflects the growing relative strength of the product, indicating increased trust and brand credibility amongst Chinese parents".Credit Suisse agrees and suggests that the fall in A2 Milk's share price, thanks to Bellamy's downfall, could be an opportunity for brave investors.Although Blackmores also produces baby formula, it's best known for its vitamin range, which has experienced a huge swell of demand from China.But like Bellamy's and A2 Milk, the biggest risks for Blackmores are for further changes in Chinese consumer regulation and the risk of cheaper alternatives eating away at its margins. Or, changing tastes.The ASX has already sent the company a please explain and it is likely the corporate watchdog ASIC will have a look at who knew what when, and see if there has been a breach of the Corporations Act.The ABC understands that several class action law firms are readying themselves to launch a case against the directors of the company.With slashed earnings forecast it is unlikely that Bellamy's share price will ever hit the heady highs of earlier this year, so those who bought in at the top are likely to remain significantly out of pocket.
