Record volumes of alpaca fleece are being shipped to China in what is hoped will set the industry up as a major new arm of Australian agriculture.A regular fixture of bed-and-breakfasts, wineries and boutique hobby farms, the long-necked animal is more likely to be associated with the cottage industry than big-scale farming.But alpaca farmers from across the country are banding together to ramp up their herd sizes and meet burgeoning demand in Asia.Producers from across New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia have this month agreed to set up a co-operative, which will band together to fuel emerging farmers.A deal with a Chinese manufacturer which wants the product for fine clothing, doonas and carpet, will see a record 10 tonnes of raw fleece shipped out of Australia each month.Peter Harford made the switch from working in IT to alpaca farming in the Macarthur region, south-west of Sydney about a decade ago.While long seen as the domain of retirees and hobby farmers, Mr Harford said it was now becoming a fully-fledged industry. "That's the exciting thing about the industry at the moment, there's always been people around to sell fleece to but they've never really offered you a really good price," Mr Harford said."With the introduction of the co-op now, the opportunity now is for people to be able to sell their fleece. "Even the small breeders, the ones that have only got two or three animals, they can now sell their fleece to the co-op and they can get a reasonable return for it."Alpaca producers from central and northern NSW, Victoria and even South Australia travelled to Mittagong in the NSW Southern Highlands to form the co-operative this month. James Wheeler made the trek all the way from SA's Fleurieu Peninsula and said he was ecstatic about the opportunity the new body presented.He said Chinese manufacturers were very interested in Australian alpaca fleece."That's got to be one of the appeals, you have that huge versatility, absolute fine lace wear, anything that drapes, all the way to carpets, stuffing of clothes, it seems to be endless," Mr Wheeler said.Keith Whitfield runs almost 200 alpacas near Goulburn and said there was massive demand to fill in Asia."It's exciting for the industry, it's going to push it in the right direction and it'll get more people interested in the animals," he said."Because a lot of them say well what do you do with them? Then we say you shear them and then what do you do with the fleece? So there's got to be an outcome for the fleece." Growing up in the southern suburbs of Sydney, 19-year-old Imogen Boughey had been angling for a career in agriculture for some time.But she admits her newfound career path in the alpaca industry has been met with some raised eyebrows."As a young teenager it's not the normal thing to do in the city, people might judge you for it, you might get teased for it," she said."But really I would not have thought that I would've loved agriculture as much as I do."Dubbed by some as the 'fibre of the gods', alpaca fleece is known for its comfort in clothing, and it is these qualities that have piqued the interest of Chinese manufacturers."The alpaca is, and I'm not biased, but it's an absolutely superb fibre â€” just so soft," Mr Harford said. The industry is embarking on a concerted push to double Australian herd numbers within the next few years, and this will be key to meeting Chinese demand.Of the co-operative's founders Mick Williams runs about 1,200 alpacas across the NSW Southern Highlands, and said producers were rising to the challenge."I don't think we'll ever have enough fleece to fulfil the world's most populated country in the world," Mr Williams said."I don't think even if we had 70 million like merino we still wouldn't be able to fulfil their needs, but we'll give it a stab with what we've got."Mr Williams said he was excited about breaking new ground in the agricultural exports space."We sent raw alpaca samples to China last month and in doing that it was the first time raw alpaca fibre had ever been sent to China [officially]," he said."We had to create the actual code to ship it."
