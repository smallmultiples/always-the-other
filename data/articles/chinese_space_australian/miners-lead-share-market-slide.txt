A greater than 5 per cent slide for an ex-dividend BHP Billiton has led the Australian share market more than a per cent lower in early trade.The benchmark ASX 200 was 1.2 per cent lower at 5,755 points by 10:19am (AEDT), while the broader All Ordinaries index was off 67 points to 5,728.The world's biggest miner, BHP Billiton, was leading the declines, despite a stabilisation in iron ore prices overnight, albeit just above six-year lows at $US58.50 a tonne in the Chinese port of Tianjin.The big Australian's market capitalisation was 5.2 per cent smaller in early trade, losing $1.67 a share to $30.24.Around half of this was due to the company trading without rights to its latest 62 US cent (81 cent) dividend from today onwards.Its main rival, Rio Tinto, was a much more modest 1.4 per cent lower at $57.77.Australia's third biggest iron ore producer Fortescue was off 3.7 per cent to $1.95, its lowest share price since the absolute peak of the global financial crisis in early 2009.Energy stocks were also being sold off on a steep slide in oil prices overnight.West Texas crude was selling at $US48.37 a barrel, Brent crude was at $US56.59 and Tapis at $US58.94.That has seen Woodside down 1.2 per cent, Oil Search 1.1 per cent, Origin 2.6 per cent and Santos 2.1 per cent to $7.18.Much of the fall in commodity prices overnight was driven by a rising US dollar on the back of the latest "tightening tantrum", as investors increase their bets that the US Federal Reserve will increase interest rates from near-zero sooner rather than later.An increasing number of analysts now expect the central bank to move in the first half of the year, rather than in September as many had previously forecast, on the back of strong job creation and falling unemployment.Higher rates in the US will mean less cheap money floating around to be invested in share markets, and raises the returns that investors require from riskier assets thus pushing their prices down.That means non-resources sectors of the local share market have not been immune from the sell-off.All four major banks were down more than 1 per cent, with Westpac's 1.3 per cent slide the worst.Telstra was down 0.5 per cent to $6.17 and Wesfarmers 0.9 per cent.Discretionary retail stocks were also lower, with JB Hi-Fi down 1.6 per cent to $17.30 and Harvey Norman 1.1 per cent.Medibank dropped 2 per cent to $2.41.The Australian dollar had also fallen against the greenback overnight, but has since steadied in morning trade.It was worth 76.35 US cents, 71.3 euro cents and 92.25 Japanese yen.
