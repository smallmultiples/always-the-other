The WA Premier has urged Australia's largest iron ore miners to end the state's mining tax debate by eliminating a production rental fee in exchange for an upfront cash payment, as major Chinese firms voice concern about the proposed tax hike.Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton pay the Government a rental fee of 25 cents per tonne of iron ore produced, under state agreements dating back to the 1960s.But under a plan being aggressively pushed by WA Nationals leader Brendon Grylls, that will increase to $5 per tonne, raising more than $7 billion over the next four years.Premier Colin Barnett believes ongoing debate about the WA Nationals' plan is creating serious concerns in the mining sector, and he has urged miners to remove the threat by paying a one-off free instead."My advice to BHP and Rio Tinto is that it would be a smart policy for them to follow," he said."That would, for them, resolve the situation."Mr Barnett said paying out the production rental fee obligation would not require a single cash payment, but could be made in several payments over time, and would not result in an elevated cost to the companies."It's cash neutral to everyone. There's no real benefit to the state. We're just wanting to resolve the issue," he said.Both BHP-Billiton and Rio Tinto have repeatedly stated they will not be taking up the offer.Mr Grylls argues the new revenue source would help balance the budget and reshape the debate over the distribution of GST revenue, which has left WA receiving just 30 cents in every dollar raised in the state.But the tax plan has been attacked by the mining industry as creating sovereign risk, with WA's peak mining lobby group, the Chamber of Minerals and Energy this week launching a multimedia campaign to highlight the risks to jobs and investment.In letters leaked to The West Australian newspaper, Japanese and Chinese customers and partners expressed deep concerns about the impact of the tax on investment decisions.Mr Barnett acknowledged the intensifying debate, but disagreed with the mining industry's approach."The mining industry is running a campaign against it. I advised them not to do that. I think it just exacerbates the situation," he said."However that's their point of view and I fully understand that, and the Government will not be increasing taxation on those mining companies."And he believes the ongoing debate about the proposed fee hike is creating serious concerns in the mining sector."There's no doubt it's causing a great deal of nervousness within those companies and a great deal of nervousness among their major shareholders and their bankers," he said."If it was in their shoes I would solve it."WA Labor leader Mark McGowan said the Nationals' proposal is a threat to the state's long-term economic security.He believed the tax was a sovereign risk and would discourage investment in the iron ore sector.He remains unconvinced by Mr Barnett's assurances that he would not agree to the tax if forced to form a minority government with the Nationals."If the Liberal-National government is re-elected, Mr Barnett will be held hostage by Mr Grylls," he said."And that is a threat to the state's economy because it will drive investment in Western Australia away."
