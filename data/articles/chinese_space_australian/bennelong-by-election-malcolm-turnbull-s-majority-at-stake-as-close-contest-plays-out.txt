Australia's political class is holding its breath over the result of the crucial Bennelong by-election that could not only determine the future of the Government, but also the fate of its leader.Voting has now closed and polls indicate a tight contest in the ballot, with even Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull conceding 100,000 people in Sydney will be casting judgment on his Government. Campaigning alongside Liberal candidate John Alexander this morning, Mr Turnbull conceded it would be a "very, very close contest" as he made his final pitch to voters."Australia's security, prosperity, depends on John Alexander being back as part of our Government, delivering more than 1,000 jobs a day," he said.Asked whether he was feeling the pressure, Mr Alexander made a reference to his days as a professional tennis player, telling reporters: "I've had pressure before in big matches, I'm fine."  Party strategists from both sides believe the Liberal Party has a slight upper hand in the ethnically diverse electorate, but Mr Turnbull was being cautious yesterday."People will be casting a judgment on the Government, which I lead, of course," Mr Turnbull told Melbourne radio station 3AW."[Losing] would reduce the Government down to 75 seats out of 150 in the House of Representatives."It certainly brings Bill Shorten one seat closer to being Prime Minister."Labor is hoping to capitalise on dissatisfaction with the Coalition Government.This morning, Labor candidate Kristina Keneally said she had been "energised" by the campaign and would continue fighting for every last vote until the polls close tonight. "There has never been a more important vote, indeed, the people of Australia are looking at Bennelong and wishing they were having their chance to have a say on this Government," she said."The people of Bennelong know how important the vote is."Ms Keneally repeated Labor's claim that the Prime Minister was "China-phobic" and pledged to "stand up for the Chinese community in Bennelong".When asked for examples of this alleged anti-Chinese rhetoric, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten cited the Prime Minister speaking in Mandarin recently."There is no doubt in my mind when he starts quoting Chairman Mao in Chinese and as the experts say, misquoting him, you say, What's going on?" he said."I don't want Mr Turnbull quoting Chairman Mao, and misquoting him, I want him fixing schools and hospitals."Mr Turnbull quoted Chairman Mao in Mandarin, while making the Government's case for new laws to counter foreign interference.He has previously described Labor 's claims as "desperate and demeaning" and pointed out that his grand-daughter has Chinese heritage. Mr Alexander quit Parliament last month amid the citizenship fiasco, worried he could be a British dual citizen.His campaign has been hampered by allegations he delayed in revealing his constitutional concerns, and accusations the Coalition is running anti-China rhetoric in its attack on outgoing Labor senator Sam Dastyari.The former tennis champ has also had to battle rumours he will retire at the next general election.The Opposition rolled out star candidate Ms Keneally in a bid to capitalise on the saga, however the Coalition has repeatedly attacked her record as premier of New South Wales.The campaign has been dirty and personal, and the major parties have thrown masses of resources at the battle. Bennelong's large Asian population will be crucial in the vote.Despite much being made of the Dastyari saga during the campaign, community leaders are quick to point out Chinese Australians are not a monolithic voting bloc."Our community is not really bothered too much about the international politics," Tony Tang from the Ryde Community Forum told the ABC."We're more concerned with local issues and policies."The electorate is also home to many Korean Australians."They're not politically 'I am Liberal supporter, I am Labor supporter', they don't want to do that," Jason Koh of Korean language newspaper Hanho said."So a high proportion of them are swing voters.The electorate of Bennelong covers Sydney's lower north shore, including the suburbs of Epping, Ryde and Eastwood.At the 2016 election, Mr Alexander was returned to Parliament with a margin of almost 10 per cent. But by-elections are often a significant reflection on the life of a government, and the loss of Bennelong would mean minority government for the Coalition.Anecdotally, some voters seem to have warmed to Ms Keneally. They might have unpleasant memories of the final incarnation of the Labor state government she ran from December 2009 to March 2011, but they don't blame her for it. The sentiment is that she did her best in difficult circumstances.There is also uncertainty about how much faith to put in to polling in Bennelong.There are significant language barriers in the diverse electorate, and voters are sick of seemingly endless robocalls gauging public opinion that they are hanging up on pollsters.
