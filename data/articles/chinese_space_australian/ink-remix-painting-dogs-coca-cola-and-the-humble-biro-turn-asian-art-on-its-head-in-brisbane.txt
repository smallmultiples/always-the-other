Australian icons like the Sydney Opera House sit alongside Chinese landscapes in a new exhibition that aims to show the changing nature of east Asia.Ink Remix: Contemporary Art From Mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong showcases artists who reinterpreted traditional ink art using different media â€” from animation to boots and everyday stationery.One of the signature pieces, Journey To Australia by Taiwanese artist Yao Jui-Chung, shows Australian icons incorporated into Chinese-inspired landscapes. The Great Barrier Reef, the Opera House, Uluru and the Gold Coast skyline all feature in the work that was drawn in biro.Curator Dr Sophie McIntyre said the Museum of Brisbane exhibition showed how Asian artists were able to sample imagery from the past and make it contemporary."These artists are very innovative," she said. "This exhibition focuses on artists born after the 1960s, and they are examining the ideas behind the ink tradition and the way it's evolved."The museum welcomed Ink Remix because of Brisbane's growing Chinese community, as well as being home to one of the largest Taiwanese communities in Australia. Dr McIntyre said the inclusion of Canine Monk from artist Peng Hung-Chih, aka the "dog artist", had drawn a range of responses. "We see his dog inscribing various texts from religions and it looks as though he's writing it," she said."What the artists did though was inscribe the script on the wall with dog food and the dog then licks the food off the wall."He then reversed the video footage to make it look like he's writing it."Another artist, He Xiangyu, also took Coca-Cola and boiled it down to produce a dark fluid that he added to a historical Chinese landscape.Dr McIntyre said she pushed to include female artists because many touring Asian exhibitions lacked them.The work of Peng Wei features items associated with femineity including boots and finely crafted slippers and busts. "She feminises the ink tradition, which has generally been male dominated in Asian culture," Dr McIntyre said."She paints on and inside the shoes and reinterprets paintings inspired by the Ming dynasty."Although many of the pieces were playful, Dr McIntyre said there were underlying political themes present."Given China's economic boom and the rapid transformation in the region, they're looking to the past but they're also trying to break away from the past," she said."There's a bridging of the past to the present and they're using reinterpreted motifs and remixing to create a new language that engages in global and local issues."It's a phenomenon that's gaining increasing popularity in east Asia where contemporary artists are looking to the past for inspiration and a sense of place."The touring exhibition will remain in Brisbane until February 19, 2017.
