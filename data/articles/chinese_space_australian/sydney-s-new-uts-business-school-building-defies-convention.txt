After one of the most ambitious building projects in Sydney's recent history, the finishing touches are being put on the radically-designed new business school at the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS). Celebrated Canadian-American architect Frank Gehry designed the building and its 320,000 elaborately arranged bricks stand in stark contrast to the nearby 1960s-era UTS Tower.The building, at Ultimo in central Sydney, is Gehry's first in Australia.Deputy vice-chancellor Professor Shirley Alexander said the new building's interior was designed to meet students' needs, and that dictated the look of its exterior.She said it was hoped the innovative structure would foster creative thinking.Its unconventional design reflected the university's move away from the most conventional form of teaching. "[There are] no more lecture theatres in our buildings because we think they can be done just as well online," Professor Alexander said.Instead, the building comprises smaller classrooms and meeting areas for hands-on learning after students watch lectures on the internet.The building's development is part of a long-term revitalisation of the university's city campus, which Professor Alexander said would generate $3.2 billion in economic activity by 2020.Â The business faculty's new home has been named the Dr Chau Chak Wing Building in honour of an Australian-Chinese businessman who donated $20 million to the project.Gehry is expected to visit the site to declare the school open for business next year.
