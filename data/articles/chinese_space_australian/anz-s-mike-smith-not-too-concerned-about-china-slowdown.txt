ANZ's chief executive has declared Australia should not be overly concerned about weakening Chinese economic growth and the continuing slide in iron ore prices.Mike Smith appeared today at a lunch hosted by Bloomberg in Sydney, speaking to a room packed with finance types wanting the know what the ANZ CEO would make of the just released Chinese gross domestic product (GDP) figures.China's annual rate of GDP growth fell to 7 per cent in the March quarter, the Asian powerhouse's weakest reading since 2009 but also exactly in line with analyst expectations and the Chinese government's growth target."I'm not so concerned. You know, I think we get this complete obsession with growth rates in China," Mr Smith told the gathering."They are, the scale of growth is just so significant. The economists today were saying that the 7 per cent growth today is exactly the same as 14 per cent growth in 2007."If Chinese demand for Australian iron ore falls, that will add further pressure to prices that have been in freefall because of increasing global supply, with industrial output perhaps the most concerning element of today's official Chinese data.But Mr Smith said he believes services and other parts of Australia's economy can fill the gap left by the declining mining sector."We're obsessed by iron ore and [believe] if that's not working, the whole economy's not working," he said."That's not true. The changes that we've seen in the Australian economy of the last few years have been significant and the rise of the services sector is huge. The opportunity for that sector is still huge."Is it any surprise that commodity prices have dropped with the sheer amount of supply that has come online? I don't think so. In many ways this is self inflicted."But that does not mean Mr Smith believes that China and Asia more broadly will be less important to the Australian economy in coming years.He said he plans to further expand ANZ's presence in Asia but also in Australia's biggest financial hub, Sydney."I believe that as we shift from a natural resources led relationship with Asia to a deeper, more multifaceted engagement, that Asia has never been more important to Australia's future and indeed that of ANZ," Mr Smith said.
