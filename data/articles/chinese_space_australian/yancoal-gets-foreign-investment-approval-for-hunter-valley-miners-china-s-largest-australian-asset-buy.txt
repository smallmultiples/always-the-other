Yancoal Australia's shareholders can expect the sale of Rio Tinto's Hunter Valley arm, Coal and Allied, to be finalised this year after clearing the federal foreign investment review hurdle.If successful, it will be the largest acquisition by a Chinese Government entity of Australian assets.The Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) has given its tick of approval to the $3.2 billion sale, announced in late January. The transaction is reliant on a number of further closing conditions but is expected to be finalised by the third quarter of 2017.Yancoal Australia, which already runs a handful of coal sites across the country, is owned by Chinese Government-controlled company Yanzhou Coal Mining.The Coal and Allied sale incorporates a majority interest in several Upper Hunter coal mines including Mount Thorley, Warkworth and Hunter Valley Operations.A stake in Newcastle's Port Waratah coal loaders will also give the business a significant strategic advantage in the Hunter's coal chain.The deal is made up of an initial cash payment of $2.57 billion and $660 million in annual instalments over five years.
