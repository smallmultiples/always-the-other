Australia and China have taken another step towards an historic free trade deal with their leaders signing a statement of intent in Canberra.It is only an agreement to make a free trade agreement, but Australia and China are talking up even closer trade ties.The Australian Government says the pact will boost the Australian economy by $18 billion over 10 years in a win-win for both countries."It opens the doors to Australia and it opens the doors to China," said Prime Minister Tony Abbott."This will provide a bigger market, more favourable conditions and better institutional support for our corporations," added Chinese president Xi Jinping.China is already Australia's biggest trading partner and two-way commerce between the two nations is worth $150 billion a year.Under the new statement of intent, signed by a cavalcade of political and business leaders, 93 per cent of Australian exports to China will be tariff-free in four years, taxes on Chinese imports including clothing and electrical goods will be removed and Australian services firms in areas like banking, education, tourism and health will gain greater access to China. The Government estimates the deal will generate $18 billion in economic benefits over a decade and consumers will enjoy a billion-dollar-a-year price cut on Chinese imports.Bank of America Merrill Lynch Australia chief economist Saul Eslake said this deal is, on the face of it, much better than other recent trade agreements Australia has signed."This, to a much greater extent than some other agreements we've signed and some other agreements that China has signed, has the great potential to be a win-win for both sides," he said.The signing of the statement of intent was brought forward to coincide with President Xi's visit for the G20 meetings.The final agreement will still be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, and after 10 years of haggling, there is still no date set. However, critics are already lining up to dispute the Government's estimated benefits."This is what we heard 10 years ago in the US Free Trade Agreement - tens of billions of dollars of benefits for the Australian economy and we know that actually it hasn't delivered anything that it promised," argued Greens Senator Peter Whish-Wilson.ACTU president Ged Kearney said the union movement is worried that Australia's biggest trade-off may be jobs."All we've heard is the Treasurer say, 'Well, we're going to get cheap TVs.' Well, I'm afraid trading away Australian jobs for cheap TVs is a price too much to pay," she said.In a 2010 study, the Productivity Commission found little or no economic benefit from free trade deals and warned that governments exaggerated the positives and downplayed the negatives.However, economist Saul Eslake said the biggest surprise in this deal is that Australian service firms will have greater access to China than any other country enjoys."I would hazard the guess that the benefits to Australia from this agreement will be greater than the $18 billion that was calculated nine years ago," he said.Remaining Chinese tariffs on Australian resources will be removed and Australian farmers are big winners as well, with dairy, beef and lamb excises to go.However, manufacturers say the deal is a missed blessing with potentially cheaper input costs on the one hand, but tougher competition on the other."We should probably come back and revisit this in three to five years and see what access Australian business has got into China and what the impact has been for Australian business here from increased Chinese competition," said Innes Willox, the Australian Industry Group's chief executive.Unions are also worried that Chinese contractors will soon be able to bring in their own workers onto Australian projects."You don't expect a government to go into a trade agreement trading away jobs, trading away Australian jobs," said the ACTU's Ged Kearney."You expect them to have agreements that will enhance and benefit Australians, improve their living standards rather than drive living standards down."However, speaking on Radio National Breakfast this morning, the Trade Minister Andrew Robb insisted that the protections in previous trade agreements would be maintained.He said that the Government can declare shortages in certain occupations allowing Chinese companies to bring in overseas workers."If they're outside of that, there will be a requirement for the employer to demonstrate that those skills are not available," he said."It is exactly the same as the provisions that existed when labour was in power."
