The case of a woman who miscarried in the toilet of a public hospital emergency department in Canberra is one of several serious complaints revealed in the ACT Human Rights Commission's annual report.The woman went to the emergency department three times and was forced to wait for an extended period for treatment that never eventuated.  She later miscarried in the toilet, without the assistance of available staff.  The report said the hospital, which was not named, has acknowledged the failure.As a result, the Health Services Commissioner Mary Durkin has set up an investigation into the delivery of antenatal services in the region.In another case outlined in the report, the Health Services Commissioner referred a specialist to a Performance and Professional Standards Panel following an investigation into a patient death.The commissioner made the referral over concerns about "the doctor's crisis management, his insistence that he was unaware of pertinent facts when the evidence appeared to indicate otherwise, and his actions which appeared to have been below the standard reasonably expected, coupled with the catastrophic outcome".In another complaint to the commission, a man was sent an apology and flowers after hot suction caps caused the hair on his back to catch fire.  The man later withdrew his complaint, but the Health Services Commissioner decided to conduct an inquiry into the matter on public health and safety grounds. The commissioner also held concerns about whether the treatment was provided without the man's informed consent as he had attended the practice for acupuncture. The report said the practice concerned has since improved its consent processes and provided additional instruction in relation to cupping treatments.The matter was referred to the Chinese Medicine Board and the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency, which was continuing inquiries into the relevant practitioners and the appropriate use of interpreters. The annual report reveals a 16 per cent increase in overall complaints last year, with 40 per cent of complaints against the Canberra Hospital.The Commission referred 134 matters to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency, an increase from 107 in the last period.There was also an increase in the number of medical professionals referred to the Commission by regulators, including six veterinary practitioners.  Five doctors and one nurse were also referred to the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal for their registration to be revoked.
