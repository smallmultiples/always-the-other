A prominent Australian investor says a slowing Chinese economy is one of the challenges facing the global economy and Australia.Billionaire Kerr Neilson runs Platinum Asset Management in Sydney which invests in international shares, not Australian stocks.Mr Neilson said he was not unusually worried about China, also noted that the world economy faced several challenges."In China, the country is slowing down quite quickly and they will have rising bad debts, non-performing assets on their banking," he said in an interview with the ABC on the sidelines of an investor presentation to another Sydney-based fund manager Park Street Group.We had very extraordinary levels of speculation ... then, of course, we found valuations that were just crazy. Mr Neilson travels frequently overseas, including to China and India.He said the Chinese economy is likely growing much more slowly than the government's target, and official statistics bureau result, of 7 per cent per annum."All the indicators we look at, and I'm not talking about electricity or those old fashioned measures, but the other measures suggest that it's growing more like 4 [per cent] or so," Mr Neilson said."The reason the government is sticking to a high growth figure is a sort of confidence boosting measure as far as we can see and, to some extent, face saving."Mr Neilson thinks the volatility may continue on Chinese share markets and the government had mismanaged the situation.He said Chinese authorities should have taken steps to reduce the amount of margin lending much sooner. "Where the mistake was made is to allow the amount of margin credit to be used to buy shares and the consequence of that is that it became a bit of a free for all and we had very extraordinary levels of speculation," Mr Neilson argued."Then, of course, we found valuations that were just crazy."Kerr Neilson expects the Australian dollar to fall further against the greenback and said investors should look offshore for returns."Many investors have problems putting money abroad; they feel they're taking big risks, whereas our position is that the one mechanism we will see working in Australia is a dropping Australian dollar and, as a consequence, we think many investors should think hard about having more money abroad," he argued.Mr Neilson said Platinum Asset Management invested in Asia because it had better growth prospects that other regions."They've got huge scale, they've got huge advantages when it comes to labour costs," he said.The billionaire investor said he favoured India because the economy was growing at more than 7 per cent annually, faster than China."We like India simply because we feel the economy is deregulating, as are the Chinese, somewhat interrupted, but they're trying to deregulate also," Mr Neilson explained."So we see the opportunities in those countries which are grasping this nettle of change and being prepared to implement measures that allow the individual, the private sector, to really prosper."While Mr Neilson sees Asia continuing to prosper, he thinks Australia needs a new strategy to manage the transition from mining to other parts of the economy."We've got a few gaps. One is from the reduction in the spending on the mining industry, and that's dropped dramatically in terms of percentage share of economic activity," he observed."The second is that the value of our exports is under pressure. Volumes are holding up fine in many areas, but the value is diminished quite a lot, so we're now back in the trade deficits and current account deficit."This will show up through the currency."Mr Neilson said that Australia did not make the best use of the revenue boost from its once in a century mining boom.We've done very little deregulation since the Keating years and that's what allows the private sector to really shine. "I think when the GFC struck we thought it was probably the end of the game and then, suddenly, we had this surge in demand as the Chinese pushed out a lot of credit to get their economy growing again and probably misled us into believing that it was more permanent that it was likely to be," he said. Platinum's managing director added that the Reserve Bank faced "an invidious problem", because if it again lowered interest rates to boost the economy it could see booming house prices rise further."On the one hand, they'd like the currency to be lower and yet if they drop interest rates precipitously it might, without help from other agencies, might further fuel property prices," Mr Neilson said.He also added that Chinese investment in the property market was helping to increase the housing supply.However, Mr Neilson said the Federal Government's policies were not helping the economy."What is it doing to boost economic growth?" he asked rhetorically."I think this is the problem, we all leave it in the hands of governments and central banks to rectify our problems and we don't necessarily, as fund managers, believe that."He said he wanted to see more deregulation of the economy to help drive the transition from the mining industry to other sectors."We've done very little deregulation since the Keating years and that's what allows the private sector to really shine and show its vitality," Mr Neilson concluded.
