Pressure is mounting on Scott Morrison to secure a landmark trade deal with Indonesia during his first overseas trip as Prime Minister.He will fly to Indonesia to meet with his counterpart Joko Widodo eight years after the two nations first began talks on a free trade agreement (FTA).Wheat exports make up about half of Australia's agricultural trade with Indonesia, and grain growers hope that could be expanded even more under a trade deal."For the grains sector, this is probably the most significant one we've had for quite some time," said Andrew Weidemann, a grain grower from western Victoria."It's very important, particularly as we're faced with trying to compete with wheat countries overseas. "But here we have an opportunity at the back door of Australia [to] build value for the Australian economy."Live animal exports, sugar, beef and cotton round out the top five Australian agricultural exports to Indonesia. If signed, this will be the fourth Asian trade agreement the Coalition Government has secured, following deals with South Korea, Japan and China. Liberal senator Simon Birmingham yesterday flew out on his first trip as Trade Minister, having assumed the role this week.The ABC requested an interview before he left but the Minister was unavailable.Mr Morrison, in announcing his trip, said in a statement that it would shape the next stage of bilateral relations with Indonesia."By making my first overseas visit as Prime Minister to Indonesia, I want to make a clear statement about the importance of our relationship, and the commitment of my government to deepening our economic and security cooperation." Australia and China signed a FTA in December 2015 and agricultural exports rose 10 per cent — more than $1 billion — in the financial year that followed.At $11 billion, China receives more than a 20 per cent of all of Australian agricultural exports.Economic forecasts have Indonesia on track to become the world's fourth-largest economy.But it is not currently one of Australia's top 10 trading partners.National Farmers' Federation president Fiona Simson said FTAs set the terms of trade, but they did not guarantee access to foreign markets."It's not just a point of establishing the market, but it's about what happens afterwards," she said. "It is about relationships, it is about networks, it is about putting our key people in there."Farmers have long wanted expanded Asian market access, especially as Australia and China's relationship has become strained in recent months.When he was in charge of trade, Steve Ciobo insisted Australia and China remain close trading partners. Ms Simson said now Mr Birmingham was overseeing the portfolio, his priority should be ensuring Australian exports could get into Asian markets."We export 70 per cent of what we produce, so we want more markets and we want also to keep the focus on protocols," she said."How can we keep delivering produce and start delivering produce to some of those new markets is just as important as establishing new markets themselves."Shadow Minister for Trade and Investment Jason Clare said trade with Indonesia was "massively underdone"."Australia and Indonesia are like neighbours who barely look over the fence," he said."We don't talk with each other, or work with each other anywhere near enough as we should."If this agreement can help to change that, can increase trade, increase jobs and bring our two countries together, then that's a good thing, but we will have to wait to see the details."Mr Clare said exporters struggling to send wine and beef to China in recent months was a sign the Federal Government had "stuffed" the relationship between the two countries. "It's important that the Australian Government reset that relationship and try to build stronger ties with the Chinese Government so Australian companies don't suffer," he said.
