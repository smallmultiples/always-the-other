Clive Palmer invented a document to justify taking $12 million from his Chinese business partners to use on his election campaign, Queensland's Supreme Court heard today.Two subsidiaries of Chinese government-owned company CITIC PacificÂ allege Mr Palmer fraudulently siphoned off the money from a fund set up to manage a port connected to their Sino Iron project in Western Australia's Pilbara.Sino Iron and Korean Steel want to prove that Mr Palmer committed a breach of trust by transferring the money, and that he dishonestly took it for his own political gain.Court documents in the civil case allege the money was deposited from Cosmo Developments to the PUP and Media Circus, which ran the Palmer United Party's advertising campaign.During the opening address, Andrew Bell for the plaintiffs said Mr Palmer created a false document over the management of the funds for the port. Creating the fake document, and backdating it, proved beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Palmer knew he was acting inappropriately by withdrawing the money, the court was told."(It demonstrates) beyond argument Mr Palmer's full appreciation that funds in that bank account were not to be used other than for purposes of port management services," Mr Bell told the Brisbane courtroom."(It) serves to reinforce the consciousness on Mr Palmer's behalf of the impropriety of the withdrawal of the funds to justify that which was not justifiable."Mr Palmer denies wrongdoing and downplayed the court action."It is just a witch-hunt because of my political views," he said."It is a bit of a beat-up."Western Australia Police confirmed yesterday its fraud squad was investigating the allegations.Mr Palmer questioned why WA police were looking into the matter if the alleged fraud took place in Queensland.If Citic had legitimate concerns, the company should have complained to the Queensland authorities, he said.A statement released by Mr Palmer's public relations agency said the statement by WA police yesterday about the investigation could prejudice Mr Palmer's rights to a fair and proper investigation."The timing, four days before the Victorian State Election where the Palmer United Party is standing candidates in all eight electoral regions of the Victorian Legislative Council (VLC), again highlights the political nature of this investigation," the statement read.Mr Palmer said News Limited, the Liberal Party and the Chinese state-owned enterprise were working in unison against him with a political agenda."The Chinese Government wants to control Australian resources. Without Australian iron ore, China can't survive," Mr Palmer said.The trial is listed for three days.
