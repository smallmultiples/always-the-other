A very small nondescript former Salvation Army Hall in Cabramatta will open its doors to the public on Saturday.The Othman Bin Affan Mosque in Water Street, Cabramatta West, is participating in the Lebanese Muslim Association's National Mosque Open Day.Sheik Dr Ayman Malas is the imam of the mosque, leading prayers, dealing with the affairs of the community and guiding the congregation in the ways of Islam.The Lebanese-born Australian citizen presides over a community of worshipers drawn from a variety of nationalities: Lebanese, Palestinians, Iraqi, Egyptian, Vietnamese, Chinese and Australian people worship at the mosque.The day is a new initiative which aims to breakdown common misconceptions and stereotypes surrounding Islam. "In the majority of mosques in Australia imams take the middle ground; they're not radicalised in any way," Dr Malas explains.While Muslims interpret the teachings of Islam differently, not all interpretations are necessarily welcome."Anyone who has a radicalised mind is not adhering to our ways, and our job is to clear that mindset," Dr Malas told 702 ABC Sydney. The open day aims to counteract anti-Islam prejudice, as well as create a two-way conversation with the broader community."This is a public place that anyone is welcome to come to at any time," said Dr Malas."This is an opportunity to share tea with family and friends, and hear directly from Muslims about our lives in an open conversation."For a number of years, mosques across Australia have inconsistently held open days.The intent of this initiative is to consolidate these into one unified national mosque open day."This is not about our humble hall, but about explaining what we are taught," said Dr Malas."Our beliefs instruct us to take the middle road in our personal life; to be a good, abiding human beings."The community-focused event will take in a fair-like atmosphere with jumping castles, barbecues, face-painting, and mosque tours.Two mosques in Sydney - Lakemba Mosque and Cabramatta Mosque - will be open from 10:00am until 4:00pm on Saturday.The Lebanese Muslim Association was established in 1962 by a group of Lebanese immigrants to provide social, religious, educational and recreational services for the Muslim community.This work led to the construction in 1972 of the grand Imam Ali bin Taleb Mosque in Lakemba.The small fibro hall in Cabramatta opened as a mosque in 1994 and exudes a more humble atmosphere than its Lakemba counterpart.For more information about which mosques are open around Australia, visit the Lebanese Muslim Association website.
