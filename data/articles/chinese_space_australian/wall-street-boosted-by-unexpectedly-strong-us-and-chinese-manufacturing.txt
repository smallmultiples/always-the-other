Australian shares are set to follow Wall Street higher, after it was boosted by unexpectedly strong US and Chinese factory activity.The Reserve Bank of Australia will hold its monthly meeting today, and no interest rate hikes (or cuts) are expected. Meanwhile, the Coalition Government will unveil the Federal budget tonight at 7:30pm (AEDT).The Budget is expected to bring forward tax cuts favouring low- and middle-income earners, allocate $600 million for regulators to target corporate misconduct, and offer small cash handouts to deal with rising power prices.The Australian dollar lifted slightly to 71.14 US cents at 7:30am (AEDT).But the dollar has fallen sharply to 54.23 British pence, as UK politicians scramble to find an alternative to Prime Minister Theresa May's unpopular Brexit deal.In US markets, the Dow Jones index surged 329 points, up 1.3 per cent, to 26,258 at 3:30pm (local time).The benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nadsaq indices jumped 1.2 and 1.3 per cent respectively."Investors are looking past the global economic slowdown and in a low-interest-rate environment, equities start to look more attractive," said Michael Geraghty, equity strategist at Cornerstone Capital Group.Concerns about a global slowdown came to the fore after the US Federal Reserve abruptly ended its monetary tightening policy two weeks earlier â€” and expectations of a rate hike this year were hosed down. This drove (long-term) 10-year US bond yields below (short-term) three-month rates for the first time in more than a decade, and sparked concerns about a potential US recession.After contracting for the past four months, China's manufacturing sector unexpectedly returned to growth in March, spurring gains in global stock markets.The Caixin/Markit manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) jumped to 50.8, its highest level in eight months. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a number below 50 shows contraction.US manufacturing activity expanded in March to 55.3, rebounding from a two-year low, according to data from the Institute for Supply Management.These figures gave some much-needed relief to investors, who have been unnerved in recent weeks about a global economic downturn.
