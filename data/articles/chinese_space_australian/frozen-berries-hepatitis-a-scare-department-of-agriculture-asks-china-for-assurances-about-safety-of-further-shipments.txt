The Federal Department of Agriculture has written to Chinese authorities demanding assurances that measures are in place to prevent further contamination of frozen berries.More than a dozen people across Australia have so far been infected with hepatitis A after eating frozen berries sourced from China.The latest confirmed case was in WA and was announced by WA Health's epidemiologist Dr Gary Dowse on Wednesday morning.Poor hygiene among workers and contaminated water supplies are thought to be behind the contamination.In a statement, the Department of Agriculture said it was engaging Chinese government authorities through Australian embassy staff in Beijing, seeking assurances about the safety of further shipments of frozen berries.Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce said country-of-origin labelling and consuming locally produced food were the most effective ways to ensure food safety."I think we have to strengthen our labelling laws and we currently have a review before us which I believe needs to be stronger than what it actually came into my office [as]," he said.Mr Joyce said it was important the public were able to make informed decisions regarding their purchases. "If you want ... better control of faecal contamination, which is a polite word for poo, if you want to make sure it's a clean, green product with the most stringent protections on it, then look for the country of origin and make sure you buy Australian," he said."We have stronger sanitary laws, we have stronger oversight to make sure we have a cleaner, green product than what comes in from overseas."It's slightly dearer but it's safer."But Prime Minister Tony Abbott indicated he was not in favour of changing food labelling laws, which he said would increase the cost for consumers."It's always got to be a question of getting the balance right because every time we demand more regulation, every time we demand different types of labelling, we add to the costs and the consumer has to pay," he said.Dr Dowse said the WA case was clearly linked to the person's consumption of the Nanna's brand of mixed berries."We now have a person in WA who has hepatitis A and clearly is linked to the consumption of these berries," he said."We expected it would happen and it has happened, and it's quite conceivable that we'll get more cases."He said members of the ill person's family have now been given a vaccine."Clearly this person developed an illness, they went to their family doctor and their doctor was astute enough to make the diagnosis," he said."Hepatitis A is unusual because it has quite a long incubation period, it can range from about two to seven weeks."Theoretically if people ate their berries last week, it could be another six weeks before they would know if they were out of the danger zone."Initially people will just start to feel a little weak and off their food, they may get a fever, they may be nauseous, they may have some pain in their tummy."Then over another week or so they might develop dark urine, then develop yellowing of the whites of their eyes in their skin."On the law of averages, most people will be fine â€” only a very small proportion of people who have eaten the berries are likely to get sick."The Red Cross Blood Service - as a "purely precautionary matter" - has asked all donors who consumed Nanna's Frozen Mixed Berries (1kg) or Creative Gourmet Mixed Berries (300g or 500g) and then gave blood either on or after November 1, 2014 to make contact. "This will help us identify whether or not we need to take further action to minimise the unlikely event of Hepatitis A being spread via blood transfusion," the service said in a statement on its website."Typically, hepatitis A possesses a very low risk to the blood supply because it is almost exclusively spread by ingestion of contaminated food."As an added precaution, the Red Cross said it would defer donors who had eaten the recalled Nanna's berries, but not yet donated, for two months from the date they last ate the product."We believe these measures are sufficient to protect the blood supply from the known risk of hepatitis A caused by this outbreak, and will continue to monitor the situation."NSW Primary Industries Minister Katrina Hodgkinson said Chinese authorities needed to explain what went wrong."I will be very interested in hearing what that explanation is," Ms Hodgkinson said."We need to make sure there are reassurances in relation to imported products such as these and what measures and systems are going to be put in place to minimise the chances of this ever occurring again."Industry group Raspberries and Blackberries Australia (RABA) said the frozen berry scare could lead to an expansion of the local industry, with growers already struggling to keep up with demand.RABA executive officer Jonathon Eccles - based on the NSW Central Coast - said with warmer climate varieties being introduced, it was an ideal time for local growers."I think it's probably an opportunity for Central Coast farms to look at growing berries because you can get into it fairly quickly and get a crop back within one year," he said."We've got this population here which has several hundred thousand people here on our doorstep."South Australian blueberry grower Grant Gatrell said demand for local product had increased since the imported berries were recalled."We've had quite a lot of phone calls over the last few days because of this hepatitis A scare and that's not unreasonable," he said."It's the end of our season so we don't have a lot of fruit, but people are really lining up to buy Australian berries."
