The Western Australian Government is demanding assurances from Chinese technology firm Huawei that it can deliver on a project worth $200 million. It follows news of US Government indictments against Huawei and the potential for a trade embargo to be imposed on the company.WA Transport Minister Rita Saffioti said the State Government was assessing whether a Public Transport Authority (PTA) contract to deliver a communications system between train drivers and their headquarters would be impacted by the unfolding global situation."The news yesterday in relation to the US has brought new information to Government," she said. "As a result we are seeking assurances from the company over whether they are able to deliver the contract."From our understanding, there are issues in relation to the import and export of components between the US and China which may impact their ability to deliver, but this is what we are seeking assurances on." Ms Saffioti said she did not have advice on how much money the Government had already paid the company, or whether taxpayers would have to cop a legal bill if the state pulled out of the contract."I don't want to go into those hypotheticals," she said.Huawei Australia chairman John Lord told ABC Radio Perth he was not afraid of losing the PTA contract.He said the WA Government had nothing to fear and the project was the company's "number one priority"."We will give those assurances to the West Australian Government and the PTA," Mr Lord said."We will give them the guarantees that we will meet all the requirements and we will make sure those supply chains are there at all times."There will be no risk to this project and we will communicate that in detail with the Government one-on-one."Huawei has been facing major controversy, with some politicians voicing their concerns about the firm's technology enabling access to Australian infrastructure. Mr Lord insisted the Chinese government had never asked nor directed the technology firm to gather information for intelligence purposes in Australia."I have been over the last seven years involved in Huawei's highest level strategic planning groups," he said."I've never seen any such influence, it's been free-flowing and in fact the points we address are: 'What is that country's view on X, Y and Z and how do we meet that in that country?'"So there has been no suggestion, no inference of any Chinese interference in our operations in other countries."Ms Saffioti said security concerns relating to Huawei's involvement in the PTA project had already been addressed. "As we highlighted [previously], we went through the Federal Government security agencies to seek assurances," she said."This a closed network and it's something that has been done in other states, in particular New South Wales, so we are confident about the security aspects in relation to the system."But what we want to make sure is that they have an ability to deliver, that is key to why we are seeking the review."Ms Saffioti said it was very early in its analysis of the recent developments, with the Government holding a series of meetings on the issue on Tuesday.She defended the Government's due diligence so far."In all contracts that Government enters, there are things that could happen globally that could impact their delivery. That happens on an everyday basis," she said.
