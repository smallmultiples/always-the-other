Federal Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce's supporters have lashed out at his Liberal critics, saying he is the natural successor to Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss.Mr Joyce's decision to oppose a Chinese-backed coal mine has reignited debate about whether he has the credentials to become deputy prime minister.Environment Minister Greg Hunt gave conditional approval to the Shenhua Watermark project last week.Yesterday, the ABC spoke to several Nationals MPs who believed it had damaged Mr Joyce's standing internally and Liberals who said it was further evidence he should not succeed Mr Truss as the country party's leader."[It's about] cabinet solidarity ... at that level of the Government, you have to play by the rules," one Liberal said.The senator said the Chinese people believed Mr Joyce was xenophobic and had raised concerns at the highest levels of Government about the possibility he would one day succeed Mr Truss.Nationals frontbencher Fiona Nash said she respected Australia's trading partners but it was not up to them to decide who would lead the National Party."For people to comment about what people in other countries are viewing as our next deputy prime minister ... when do people in other countries decide who the Nationals leader is?" she said."It's a matter for the Nationals party room and the Nationals will decide who the next Nationals leader will be."Senator Nash said she suspected the criticism was "from people who don't like the fact that he's tough and gets things done"."Warren will be leader for as long as he chooses, we have enormous respect for him in our party room, however Barnaby has my complete support to be Warren's successor," she said.Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the claim about the Chinese raising concerns about Mr Joyce was probably just "mischief"."I have no doubt that if the Chinese have any concerns about the Australian Government, they will raise them with us," she told Sky News."And I've not had any contact by anyone in the Chinese government or representing the Chinese government make any such contact with me."Nationals Senator Matt Canavan, who used to work for Mr Joyce, described the anonymous Liberal critics as low-lifes."That's exactly what people hate — people like people who have the backbone of being up front and tell people what they think," he said."They hate people who go behind people's backs and like to sneak around in the darkness and think they're Machiavellian." Senator Canavan said Mr Joyce had clearly been marked as a potential future leader."People are crying out for a politician who that stands on their digs, they're crying out for someone who just shows some spine and backbone and [is] up front and honest with people," he said."That's what I hear when I'm going round — that people actually find it refreshing that there's someone in politics that's like that."Earlier this week The Australian newspaper reported Shenhua's project manager Peter Jackson had called Mr Joyce xenophobic.Mr Joyce said Mr Jackson's comments were "very unfortunate"."I think you have to be very careful about what you say about other people, especially in public office, especially when they're incorrect," he said."It's so absurd, I mean my brother-in-law's Chinese, my sister-in-law's Chinese."
