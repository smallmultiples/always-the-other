Three Australian citizens are reportedly among 18 employees of James Packer's Crown Resorts group that have been detained in China.The Australians are members of Crown's sales and marketing team. One of the individuals is believed to be a senior executive.Crown Resorts is not revealing the reason for the arrests."Crown believes that a number of our employees in China are being questioned by local authorities and at this time we can provide no further details," a spokesman said in a statement.While Crown runs three casinos in Macau, it is understood the arrests happened in multiple cities across mainland China. Chinese authorities have not confirmed the arrests, which come amidst the backdrop of an anti-corruption drive that has targeted money laundering at Macau casinos.The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) said it was trying to confirm the reports with Chinese authorities."The Australian Government is aware of reports of the possible detention of a number of Crown International Group employees across China, including three Australians," a spokesperson for DFAT said. "Consular officials are seeking to confirm these reports with the relevant Chinese authorities."If Australians have been detained, consular officials will seek to offer appropriate consular assistance in accordance with the Consular Services Charter."In recent years the Chinese Government's corruption crackdown has affected business across the casino sector.In 2009 Stern Hu, a senior executive for mining giant Rio Tinto, was charged as part of China's corruption crackdown with taking and receiving commissions.Mr Hu pleaded guilty and was sentenced to ten years in prison after admitting to stealing commercial secrets.The crackdown has resulted in falling revenues with Crown and other big players reporting fewer customers and adding pressure on sales staff to fill the resorts.However it is unclear if the sales pressure is related to the Crown staff being detained.
