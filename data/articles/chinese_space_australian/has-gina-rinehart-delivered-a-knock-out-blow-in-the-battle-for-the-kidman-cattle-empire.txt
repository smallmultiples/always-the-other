Australian billionaire businesswoman Gina Rinehart has delivered a one-two punch which may knock out her rivals in the fight to buy the Kidman cattle empire.Her first glancing blow was to raise Australian Outback Beef's (AOB) bid for S Kidman and Co from $365 million to $386.5 million.AOB — two thirds owned by Mrs Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting and one-third owned by Chinese conglomerate Shanghai CRED — is now offering half a million more than a competing syndicate of wealthy Australian graziers.A $500,000-margin is not necessarily a game-ender when dealing with sums in the hundreds of millions of dollars.It is, however, a signal that the gloves are off, and that Mrs Rinehart is serious. And she has deep pockets. But it is Mrs Rinehart's second strike which is more bruising for the Buntine, Brinkworth, Harris and Oldfield (BBHO) families — the revelation that Hancock Prospecting would buy the entire Kidman portfolio itself if Shanghai CRED's investment does not get the necessary approvals from the Australian and Chinese Governments. Effectively, Mrs Rinehart is saying she too can mount an all-Australian bid.That removes the biggest advantage her rivals have had, and it means that gaining foreign investment approval from Federal Treasurer Scott Morrison is no longer a do-or-die prospect for Mrs Rinehart's ambitions to take over Australia's largest private landholder.It puts the mining magnate and cattle queen in a strong position.The Kidman board has recommended that its shareholders accept the revised AOB offer in the absence of a "superior" bid.BBHO is still getting the paperwork together to formally lodge its $386-million offer, announced last week.  Now the syndicate's members are considering whether they boost their offer and buy into a bidding war with Mrs Rinehart."If you don't bleed for the land, you don't want it badly enough," said NT and WA cattle producer Sterling Buntine when he launched his syndicate's Kidman bid in Canberra.The battle for Australia's largest private landholder could be a bloody fight indeed.
