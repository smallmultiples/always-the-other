The Navy is calling on families of sailors lost aboard HMAS Sydney to consider genetic testing, so one of the country's great maritime mysteries can be solved — the identity of the unknown sailor from the ship.HMAS Sydney was lost off the Western Australian coast in November 1941, after a short but vicious battle with a German raider, The Kormoran.All 645 men aboard Sydney were lost without a trace, save for one body which washed up in a life raft on Christmas Island in February 1942.Naval historian Greg Swinden, who is in charge of the project to identify the sailor, said with this year's 75th anniversary of the ship's loss, answers were vital."It's important not just for the country but the families of those lost on the Sydney to discover the identity, so he can be given back," Mr Swinden said. "It's also Australian government policy to try and identify our unknown sailors, soldiers and airmen when they are found."Ten years ago, DNA recovered from that body was sent to the ancient DNA lab at Adelaide University to try find a match with a living relative.Head of the lab, Dr Jeremy Austin, said one reason the quest was taking so long was that DNA testing in real life was nothing like an episode of CSI, where answers come at the click of a mouse."That's a really good question," he laughs. "There wasn't any trouble getting the DNA, the trouble is finding the relatives."Dr Austin said that was related to the nature of the DNA recovered from the sailor."It's mitochondrial DNA which is present in a much higher number in cells and so it survives much longer in degraded remains," he said."It's the same type of DNA that was used to trace relatives of Richard III who died over 600 years ago." The disadvantage with mitochondrial DNA is that it is passed through the maternal line, from mother to child.Whoever the unknown sailor is, his direct descendants; sons, daughters, grandchildren do not share his mitochondrial DNA and so there would be no point testing them.Mr Swinden said that makes for a much more complex family tree."That's the hard part, to find the suitable relatives and in many cases when we do locate a suitable relative they have no idea they are related to a sailor lost on board HMAS Sydney," Mr Swinden said."In some cases we've had to go back to the sailor's grandmother and in one case a great grandmother and then trace down the line to find a suitable relative to test."To make the task easier the Navy drew up a short list of 120 of Sydney's crew for family testing, based on dental records and other observations of the remains.But while the identity of the Sydney sailor remains elusive, it is helping to produce a much more nuanced genetic picture of Australia and the Australian Defence Force.Along with the Sydney project, remains from other battles in both world wars are being tested at the ancient DNA lab.Dr Austin said while most Australians back then were from an Anglo-Saxon background, things were not so black and white as assumed."We are now seeing that there are a small frequency of people from non-European backgrounds who were in the Australian forces in the first and second world war," Dr Austin said."We know Aboriginal Australians fought in both wars and also Australians with Chinese heritage."Dr Austin said in the case of remains from Kokoda trail in Papua New Guinea, it meant genetic markers of Asian ancestry were no longer assumed to automatically point to a Japanese soldier — he could be Australian.Mr Swinden said people who think they may be a Sydney sailor relative should contact him, so a DNA sampling kit can be mailed out, which will then be forwarded to Dr Austin in Adelaide."Every set of remains was someone's father, brother, husband, uncle and so there are still people alive in Australia who care deeply about who these people are," Dr Austin said.
