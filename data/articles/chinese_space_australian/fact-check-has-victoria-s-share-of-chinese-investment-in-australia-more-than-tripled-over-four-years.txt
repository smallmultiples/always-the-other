The Andrews Government has been accused of interfering with Australian foreign policy after becoming the first and only state to sign up to a controversial Chinese infrastructure and trade plan.In October 2018, Premier Daniel Andrews announced a memorandum of understanding tying Victoria to China's Belt and Road Initiative — an economic and geopolitical strategy involving massive infrastructure investment across Europe, Asia and Africa."This new Australian-first agreement sums up everything we have achieved with China over the past four years — it means more trade and more Victorian jobs and an even stronger relationship with China," Mr Andrews said in a press release."In four years we have more than tripled Victoria's share of Chinese investment in Australia ... We said we'd reboot our relationship with China and we're getting it done."Has Victoria's share of Chinese investment in Australia more than tripled over four years? RMIT ABC Fact Check investigates.Mr Andrews's claim is a fair call.Victoria's share of total Chinese investment in Australia has increased since 2014.However, as the figures relied on by Mr Andrews demonstrate, investments can be "lumpy", with significant fluctuations in different jurisdictions year-to-year.The figures themselves have limitations requiring interpretation. For example, in 2017, Victoria's share of total Chinese investment increased to 36 per cent, from 25 per cent in 2016. This increase was entirely underpinned by a single $3.4 billion deal in which Chinese coal company YanCoal acquired Rio Tinto subsidiary Coal & Allied Industries.Because Rio Tinto is headquartered in Melbourne, the investment was attributed to Victoria, even though the coal assets acquired are in NSW.For the sake of analysis, attributing this single, large acquisition to NSW rather than Victoria tells a vastly different story, indicating Victoria's share of the total increased little between 2008 and 2017.Moreover, expressing the figures as a share of the national total, as Mr Andrews has done, tells us little about the dollar value of Chinese investment flowing to Victoria.Rather, it provides an indication of Victoria's performance relative to other states.Nevertheless, experts contacted by Fact Check suggested the Andrews Government was entitled to claim some credit for increasing Victoria's share of the total over time, having vigorously pursued Chinese business.Information on Chinese foreign investment in individual Australian states is somewhat limited.The Australian Bureau of Statistics, for example, does not provide a breakdown of foreign investment on a state-by-state basis.Fact Check asked Mr Andrews's office for a source. A spokesperson referred Fact Check to the state government document Victoria's China Strategy - Progress Report 2018.This contains a chart showing Victoria's share of Chinese investment in Australia rising from a "baseline" of 8 per cent to 25 per cent.However, the figures cited in the report are unsourced and the time-frame is somewhat vague.The spokesperson subsequently indicated that the government report relied on information compiled by consulting firm KPMG in the publication Demystifying Chinese Investment in Australia, which is updated annually.This publication, in turn, relies on data jointly compiled by KPMG and the China Studies Centre at the University of Sydney Business School. The KPMG report uses figures covering investments in Australia made by entities from China through mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, and greenfield projects. The analysis also examines real estate transactions.The figures do not include so-called portfolio investments, such as the purchase of stocks and bonds, "which do not result in foreign management, ownership or legal control".Nor does the analysis include completed deals worth less than $US5 million, "as such deals consistently lack detailed, reliable information."Also, the KPMG breakdown of the state-by-state distribution of Chinese investment involving existing assets is based on the location of the head office of the Australian company in which it is investing or with whom it is partnering, not on the physical location of the actual investment project.The raw data relied upon in the report was drawn from "a wide variety" of public sources "verified, analysed and presented in a consistent and summarised fashion".These sources included commercial databases and corporate information, as well as official Australian and Chinese sources such as the ABS, the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China.The KPMG report is not the only source of information on Chinese investment in Australia at the state level.A database compiled by the East Asian Bureau of Economic Research at the Australian National University, The Chinese Investment in Australia (CHIIA) database, also provides a state-by-state breakdown.As with the KPMG report, the CHIIA database counts not only Chinese investments in Australia from mainland China, but also investments by Chinese subsidiaries operating in Australia.Fact Check did not form a view about which of these two data sets most accurately represents Chinese investment in Victoria.Both appear to be underpinned by in-depth research, with some methodological differences.Mr Andrews said Victoria's share of Chinese investment in Australia had more than tripled over four years.According to KPMG's Demystifying Chinese Investment in Australia: May 2015 Update, Victoria was the recipient of an estimated $757 million worth of Chinese investment, out of a total of $9.46 billion for Australia, in 2014 — the year in which the Andrews Government was elected.That represents an 8 per cent share of the total.The latest report (June 2018) found Victoria soaked up 36 per cent of the total in 2017 — $4.72 billion out of $13.35 billion.That represents a four-and-a-half-fold increase in the state's share of the total between 2014 and 2017.  Victoria's share in 2017 was up from 25 per cent in 2016.As previously noted, the steep increase in Victoria in 2017 was underpinned by a Chinese coal mining company, Yancoal, acquiring Rio Tinto's NSW Hunter Valley coal assets (Coal & Allied Industries).This was recorded as an increase in Chinese investment in Victoria because Rio Tinto is headquartered in Melbourne — even though the assets acquired in the deal are in NSW.For the sake of analysis, if the $3.4 billion deal is attributed to NSW, not Victoria, then Victoria's share of the national total shrinks to just 9.9 per cent in 2017, and the share for NSW increases to 68 per cent.As the 2018 KPMG report put it: "If NSW was attributed with the capital proceeds invested from the Yancoal deal, NSW would account for 68 per cent of total Chinese investment in Australia in 2017." Also, as previously noted, expressing the figures as a share of the national total, as Mr Andrews has done, tells us little about the dollar value of Chinese investment flowing to Victoria.Rather, it provides an indication of Victoria's performance relative to other states.For example, although Victoria's share of the total increased by 44 per cent in 2017, rising from 25 per cent to 36 per cent, the dollar value of Chinese investment in the state rose by a more modest 22.8 per cent, from $3.84 billion to $4.72 billion.This reflected a fall in the total level of Chinese investment in Australia.As mentioned, the other comprehensive database of Chinese investment per state is provided by Australian National University: The Chinese Investment in Australia (CHIIA) database.It paints a broadly similar picture to the KPMG study, although the timing of the surge in Victorian investment appears to differ, possibly due to methodology.It shows a three-fold increase in Chinese investment between 2014 and 2017, but with a large spike in 2016. Hans Hendrischke, Professor of Chinese Business and Management at the University of Sydney's China Studies Centre, and one of the authors of the KPMG study, said the figures tended to fluctuate from year-to-year."But what [Mr Andrews] says is correct in the sense that Victoria has attracted more investment," Professor Hendrischke said.He added that it was open to interpretation whether a state government could entirely claim credit, with the level of investment partly dependent on local economic conditions and specific projects.But he said state governments could have an impact by actively pursuing investment, with an element of competition existing between jurisdictions."State governments compete for Chinese investment and Victoria, as much as Western Australia, as New South Wales; they all have either their local trade promotion or investment promotion officers or offices," Professor Hendrischke added."Their premiers do talk to Chinese investors and try to get investors. So there is a competition between states, and if one state does particularly well, you would certainly want to give them credit for that."Nicholas Henderson, the Director of Asialink's China Practice, said that in recent years there had been some significant multi-billion-dollar Chinese acquisitions in Victoria, which had boosted the investment figures.He said the Victorian Government could claim some credit for an increase in Chinese investment in Victoria, given it had vigorously pursued Chinese business with a strong "on the ground" presence in China."They do have quite a comprehensive approach towards China, which would yield outcomes which wouldn't be misaligned with the claim made by the Premier," he said.Principal researcher: Josh Gordon, Economics and Finance EditorAdditional research: Sushi Das and David Campbellfactcheck@rmit.edu.au
