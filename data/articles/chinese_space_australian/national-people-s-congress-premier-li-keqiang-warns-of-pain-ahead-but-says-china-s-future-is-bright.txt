The long-term prognosis for Australia's largest trading partner is good but in the meantime China could be in for some tough years.That's the message from China's number two leader, Li Keqiang, at the end of the annual National People's Congress (NPC).At the only press conference he gives all year, Mr Li said his government is seeking to boost the private sector and domestic demand and that in so doing it is running headlong into major vested interests."This is not clipping your nails," he said."This is like taking a knife to your own flesh so pain is only natural but — however painful it may be — we're determined to keep going until our jobs is done."The Chinese economy is under enormous pressure with fears of overcapacity, local government debt and a potential real estate bubble.Unlike other comparable countries, in recent years Australia has avoided recession. This is in no small part because of Chinese demand for Australian raw materials.Though China has been growing at a slower rate — with the government in Beijing setting a GDP target this year of 7 per cent — Mr Li reiterated that everyone has to get used to figures like this as his country shifts emphasis from export to domestic consumption.However he also said that Beijing would not allow unemployment to get out of hand; that they will prop up the economy if things get bad."In recent years we have not taken any strong, short-term stimulus policies," Mr Li said."So we can say our room for policy manoeuvre is relatively large. We have many tools in our toolbox."Coming at the middle of China's five-year political cycle, this session contained no great surprises in terms of policies but the environment took on an unexpected significance at the congress.In the days leading up to the NPC, an online documentary about air pollution was reportedly watched by hundreds of millions of people.Some see this as the most significant problem Beijing has on its hands.For all illegal production and illegal emissions they will be held accountable... We need to make the cost of these too high to bear. The questions for this press conference are vetted by officials and reporters are called on to ask them in order.When the question came about pollution, a journalist specifically mentioned the powerful Chinese state-owned enterprises Sinopec and Petrochina in terms of their responsibility for this country's environmental destruction.He asked if it was true that they had been an obstacle to enforcing environmental protection laws.The reporter confirmed to the ABC that his question was approved with these companies mentioned by name.The premier wanted to be asked.This could indicate that the government has them in its sights and indeed Mr Li did threaten to come down heavily on big polluters."For all illegal production and illegal emissions they will be held accountable," he said."We need to make the cost of these too high to bear."Because this is such a highly controlled event, analysts believe that every single word that comes out of Mr Li's mouth is approved by the Communist Party for consumption right around the globe.Yet, at the very end, there did seem to be a question from a Chinese journalist which came off the cuff.The premier was asked about the reports that troops from Myanmar have been straying into Chinese territory in their battles with local rebels in the border region.An aircraft from Myanmar is said to have bombed part of China, killing four people.Mr Li had a stern warning for his neighbours."We have the responsibility and the capacity to firmly safeguard stability in the border areas with Myanmar," he said.This is a Chinese administration which appears to be exuding confidence in the face of all challenges.
