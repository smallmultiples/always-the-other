Dozens of new high-capacity trains will be built in Victoria, creating more than 1,000 jobs, the Andrews Government has announced.The 65 new Metro trains will be built by the Evolution Rail consortium using 60 per cent local content, the Victorian Government said. Apprentices, trainees, cadets and people from disadvantaged backgrounds will make up 15 per cent of the workforce. Premier Daniel Andrews said the trains would have 20 per cent more space than they do currently, in an attempt to reduce overcrowding on the strained Melbourne network."On the Cranbourne-Pakenham line where they'll run from the beginning of 2019, we'll see 39,000 extra passengers able to travel on that, our busiest line, in the morning and afternoon peaks," he said."This is the highest local content anywhere in Australia that any State Government has delivered, perhaps ever, certainly in modern times."But the Australian Workers' Union slammed the Government's decision to give the job to Evolution Rail, saying the Chinese contractor had "a record of structural defects in its trains"."The contract should have gone to the bidder who would create the most local jobs," Victorian Secretary Ben Davis said.Mr Davis said the Government had not lived up to its promise of local content, and if the contract was given to Bombardier, 70 per cent of the trains would be made in Victoria."It is beyond disappointing when jobs go to China, but this is heartbreaking to see what should have been a manufacturing boost for the state turned into little more than an assembly project."Public Transport Minister Jacinta Allan said the trains would be ready in time for the opening of the Metro Rail tunnel project in 2026."These are the trains that will service the Metro Tunnel when we connect the Dandenong line with the Sunbury line," Ms Allan said."They're bigger trains, they'll provide for more passengers, but also too they'll have the latest technology, the latest design, there will be better information for passengers within the trains themselves, contributing overall to a better public transport experience."Mr Andrews announced the contract at Downer Rail at Newport in Melbourne's west.The workshop will get a $16 million makeover to build the trains, while a new maintenance and stabling depot will be built in Pakenham in the outer east.
