How much is a breath of Western Australia's air worth?It is a question people living in the smog-affected cities of China, Korea and India could soon be asking themselves.A company that sells canned air to foreign markets says it plans to export air from Margaret River, a region known for its wine and waves about 270 kilometres south of Perth, within 12 months.Green and Clean Air currently sources air from the Blue Mountains west of Sydney and markets it to the middle-class of India, China, Vietnam and Korea where poor air quality is an issue.It is also in talks with organisations in the Middle East.The World Health Organisation estimates there are about 7 million premature deaths per year related to outdoor and household air pollution, with the majority of those deaths occurring in South-East Asia and the Western Pacific Region.In 2013 China waged a national war against air pollution amid horrendous smog in the country's north.Initially, Green and Clean Air's vision was to capture and sell air from different locations across Australia and New Zealand, including Bondi Beach and the Gold Coast as well as areas in Tasmania. The company had also planned to set up in Margaret River in July 2016 and have cans of its air on Chinese shelves six weeks later.But Green and Clean Air director John Dickinson said the plan, which would have resulted in the air being sold for almost 10 cents a breath, would not have been viable."The challenge was that logistically, as the product became more and more popular, the logistics of actually sourcing air in bulk from all different locations just proved too much," he said."First of all you've got to get all the cannisters printed specifically for that region."So instead of having half a million cannisters all printed with the same label, you're now printing off smaller numbers for specific areas."You've also got to not only farm or harvest the air, but transport those cannisters to wherever your main depot is to be either held or sent overseas."When you're doing that from multiple locations, you can understand that would be quite the logistical feat."Under the initial plan a cannister of air, which holds about 180 breaths, would have sold for $18.80.Users are able to breathe in the air by using a cap attached to the cannister that can be placed over their face like a surgical mask.  The company is now looking again at the viability of launching a Margaret River product."We've had a lot of talk this year about launching a premium line of air captured from different parts of the country," Mr Dickinson said."That will probably come at a premium price because it costs us a lot more to physically do it."The fact that it's such a beautiful, clean and pristine area, that's enough for me to want to do it."Mr Dickinson said the project was in the pipeline and would come to fruition within 12 months.He said the company made no claim about there being any health benefits from using the product.
