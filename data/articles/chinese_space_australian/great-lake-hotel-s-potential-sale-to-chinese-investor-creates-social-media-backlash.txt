The potential sale of a uniquely-situated Tasmanian hotel has caused controversy amid fears the business will fall into the hands of overseas investors.The Great Lake Hotel at Miena in the heart of the state's Central Highlands has somewhat of a cult following online, with close to 30,000 followers on its Facebook page. That social media popularity is likely driven by regular postings capturing the area's snowfall, which can occur all-year round.Last October, licensee Kaylee Hattinger announced she was putting the pub up for sale after managing it for more than 12 years.On Tuesday, Ms Hattinger again took to Facebook to confirm it was still on the market with an asking price of $1.2 million. "Few rumours going around- the pub is still 'For Sale' - we have had some interest and yes they are Chinese," she said.It caused outrage from some fans, who said they would not return if the new owner was based overseas.The post started an online slanging match."Well unfortunately we cannot control who buys it, but if the buyer is overseas then I wont be returning," one person commented."If you sell to the Chinese that don't even live here, you are off your head. Keep Australia Australian," said another."I thought the Chinese buying all Australian farms would have been enough of a wake up call," another added.Some people were concerned the comments against overseas investment were racially motivated."Why does it matter whether Chinese or James Packer or Mickey Mouse buys the hotel?" one asked."If I were selling my home, I wouldn't be bloody racist so what's with all the racist comments? Very un-Australian," another said.Ms Hattinger said the reaction was disappointing as any investor would boost the region's tourism potential."I'm a bit surprised at the response," she said.She said any investor would want to expand the hotel's tourism potential."They [potential buyers] do want to keep the traditional aspects of the pub," she said."For me to value add and build nice rooms the class of what the traveller is expecting now, I don't have that money."I would love to see this business go to a young couple with enthusiasm and a plan." Ms Hattinger said a three-month exclusivity clause with the agents had expired.
