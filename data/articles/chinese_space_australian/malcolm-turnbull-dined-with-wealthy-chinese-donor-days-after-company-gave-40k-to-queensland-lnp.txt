A Chinese businessman had dinner with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull just four days after one of his companies declared a $40,000 donation to Queensland's Liberal National Party (LNP). The revelation comes amid debate about Chinese companies trying to exert influence on the nation's political class through financial donations and lobbying, and on the eve of the Queensland election.The businessman, Liu Xiaodong, is one of three directors of Gold Coast-based company Australian Energy Windfarm (AEW), which describes itself as "China's responsible wind power supplier".Mr Liu is also the chairman of China-based renewable energy giant Heilongjiang Ainaji Dianli Co Ltd, which owns 100 per cent of AEW and is pursuing major investment opportunities in Queensland. The donation was declared with the Queensland Electoral Commission on November 15.The ABC understands Mr Turnbull had not heard of Mr Liu until they met at a dinner four days later in Brisbane.Questioned about the dinner on Friday, Mr Turnbull said: "I don't recall having a detailed discussion … his English was very limited."Look, it was a general discussion about the economy. I don't recall — certainly nothing of particularity about investment policies of that kind were raised."Obviously we have a lot of Chinese investment in Australia and as I said yesterday at the launch of the foreign policy White Paper there are occasions where foreign investment, including Chinese investment, does not get approval on reasons of national interest, but by and large Australia welcomes foreign investment."The company reported the Sunday night dinner on its Mandarin website but deleted it shortly after being contacted by the ABC. "The Prime Minister was invited to a function hosted by the LNP in Brisbane. The guest list is a matter for the LNP," a spokesman for the Prime Minister said earlier.  There is no record of AEW having any significant projects in Australia and the business is registered at a suburban house.Its website is incomplete but says it is planning a solar power plant near Kingaroy in Queensland.ASIC documents show Mr Liu has a registered address at the Sanctuary Cove golf resort south of Brisbane. Queensland LNP state director Michael O'Dwyer said the party accepted donations from all Australian registered companies."The company in question is a proprietary limited company registered with ASIC and the donation has been disclosed in accordance with the Electoral Commission of Queensland's guidelines," he told the ABC.The LNP also told the ABC the party held functions "as part of its normal activities with a broad spread of guests" and that the Sunday dinner was "just one of a series held over the past month".LNP leader Tim Nicholls said he "didn't know anything" about the dinner.Mr Liu was seated next to the Prime Minister, on his right, at a 12-person dinner in Brisbane.The ABC has not yet confirmed the identity of the other guests.It is not clear who invited Mr Liu or who determined the seating arrangement.The Chinese parent company says its Australian affiliate was established in line with the Chinese Government's "One Belt One Road" initiative; a trillion-dollar push to dominate trade that has raised concerns within Australia's intelligence community. The ABC has contacted AEW and Heilongjiang asking for the motivation for the political donation, but no response was received before deadline.The AEW website claims it has "been in this industry for several decades with exceptional practical skills, profession, strong business relationships among suppliers, governments, construction [sic], which are the major foundation for our success".But the company was only registered with ASIC in September 2016. That same month, Mr Liu claims to have led a delegation to Australia to explore energy investment opportunities.The registered email address for AEW is the same email address listed on the Chinese parent company's website. When the ABC contacted AEW for comment, the spokesman said he did not speak English.It is unknown where the dinner was held.
