The union trying to save train manufacturing jobs in the Hunter Valley has accused the Minister for the Hunter of showing no interest in the futures of the workers and their families.The Australian Manufacturing Workers Union (AMWU) secured more than 10,000 signatures on a petition calling on the government to build new trains locally.It forced debate on the subject in state parliament.AMWU secretary Tim Ayres said the Minister Gladys Berejiklian treated those at risk of losing their jobs with contempt."This is an issue that puts 3,000 Hunter Valley jobs in the balance," he said."The New South Wales Government is going to make Sydney trains in third world countries."It's particularly disappointing that the New South Wales Government's Minister for the Hunter, Gladys Berejiklian, who is also the Transport Minister and responsible, didn't even turn up for the debate."Mr Ayres said it is crucial the $2.5 billion contract to build 65 new trains for the New South Wales rail network stays in Australia."We know that the Hunter Valley manufacturers are the highest quality train manufacturers in the world," he said."They've got the capacity to deliver these trains on time and under budget. "They just need a fair go from government. "They need government to decide that it is going to support Australian manufacturing, not Indian and Chinese manufacturing."
