Much stronger-than-expected Chinese trade data have significantly boosted the Australian dollar and miners.The closely-watched official figures showed that exports in September surged 15.3 per cent from a year ago, ahead of economist forecasts in a Bloomberg survey that centred on 12 per cent annual growth.More importantly for Australia, China's imports, which were expected to have fallen around 2 per cent, actually rose 7 per cent.Specifically, China's demand for iron ore in September was up 13.1 per cent from August, sparking a dramatic recovery in the share prices of Australian miners.Iron ore specialist Fortescue Metals jumped nearly 6 per cent to $3.45, while Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton were up 1.9 and 0.9 per cent respectively by 1:37pm (AEDT).The data also showed that coal imports - another key Australian export to China - were up 12.2 per cent to 21.2 million tonnes. Whitehaven Coal was up 1 cent to $1.51.The Australian dollar also received a boost from the figures, rising from a low around 86.5 US earlier this morning to a peak of 87.5 US cents, before easing back slightly to 87.32.The next major read on the Chinese economy will come with next week's release of industrial production, retail sales and gross domestic product data.Economists are generally expecting China's economic growth to have slowed from 7.5 per cent in the second quarter to 7.2 per cent over the three months to September 30.
