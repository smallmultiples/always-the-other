The local share market is expected to drop in early trade, over concerns about China's economic slowdown and its impact on other nations. Meanwhile, the Australian dollar was slightly weaker at 71.65 US cents and 62.7 euro cents at 7:20am (AEDT) — but steady at 54.45 British pence.The benchmark ASX 200 index will likely follow Wall Street's downbeat lead — in particular the Dow Jones index, which closed 209 points lower, down 0.8 per cent, to 24,528.The S&P 500 fell 0.8 per cent to 2,644 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 1.1 per cent to 7,086.The biggest drag on the Dow was heavy equipment maker Caterpillar, after it reported earnings that fell below market expectations for the first time in 10 quarters.Caterpillar posted a decline in construction equipment sales in the Asia-Pacific region in the latest quarter, mainly due to cooling Chinese demand.Its share price plunged 9.1 per cent to $US124.37, its worst trading day in seven years.Investors are concerned that the US-China trade war has not only affected China's economy but also American corporate profits.The company now expects construction equipment sales in China, the world's second-largest economy, to be flat this year."Every time we get earnings stating China as a problem, investors start to realise that issues with China are going to spread," said Ryan Nauman, market strategist at Informa Financial Intelligence."And without China growing at a good clip it will be hard for the global economy and the US to continue an expansion."China, which accounts for up to 10 per cent of Caterpillar's sales, last week reported its slowest economic growth in nearly three decades.Since China is one of the world's largest commodities importers, its slowing economy is having a ripple effect on global commodity prices, which also hurt the company's equipment sales in the mining, oil and gas industries.Earlier this month, Apple issued a rare profit downgrade and blamed, in part, slower iPhone sales on a worsening Chinese economy.Also weighing down Wall Street was chipmaker Nvidia, which slashed its fourth quarter revenue estimate by about $US500 million overnight."The fourth quarter was an extraordinary, unusually turbulent, and disappointing quarter," Nvidia's chief executive Jensen Huang said.Nvidia blamed weaker demand for its gaming chips in China and lower-than-expected data centre sales, sending its stock 13.8 per cent lower at $US138.01.The company forecast lower revenue of $US2.2 billion for the quarter ended January 27 — downgraded from its earlier forecast of $US2.7 billion.Meanwhile, European markets ended sharply lower, particularly London (-0.9pc), Frankfurt (-0.6pc) and Paris (-0.8pc).Brent crude oil also experienced steep losses, down 2.7 per cent to $US60 a barrel.ABC/Reuters
