The manager of Bendigo's Golden Dragon Museum says it is up to the city council to decide if funding for a rotten archway is a priority.The entrance to the Dai Gum San precinct was removed last year and no decision has been made on whether it will be restored or replaced.The museum's Anita Jack said the council needed to decide if the entrance was a tourism attraction that deserved money."Culturally it doesn't make any sense not to have an archway," she said."If you go to any Chinatowns around the world they do have an archway, so for Bendigo to sit itself as the premiere place to learn about Australian Chinese history and to not have an archway, it culturally does not sit right. It's culturally not correct."She said it was up to the community to contact the council."We do think it's really important that if the people of Bendigo want to see that archway in the future, they need to write to the council and make sure that the council do allocate in their budget, some money to make sure it is considered in the future," she said.Bendigo Mayor Peter Cox said council staff were preparing a report about the archway."Everybody, whatever their particular issue, needs to make submissions to council, so they close on the 15th of May," he said."We've got a public hearing on the 26th of May."So [I] certainly encourage the Chinese association, along with all other groups, to submit to council about the budget."He said the archway issue needed to be considered alongside other council projects."It's a little bit early to understand how we might restore that archway," he said."I know that council have got a presentation coming forward so the officers are currently preparing a report to present to councillors."
