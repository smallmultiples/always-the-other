Spending by Chinese tourists is forecast to jump to $4.1 billion in Australia this year as a growing middle class and appetite for quality goods and clothes spur spending, according to a report.The report Golden Dragons: The Spending Habits of Chinese Tourists from Cross Border Management, warned a lack of engagement from Australian retailers during winter months to Chinese tourists may mean a missed revenue opportunity. "Surveys of Chinese shoppers show they want (language) signs, the company of other Chinese, and someone who can help them while they're shopping," the report said."Although the value of Chinese New Year has generally been recognised and Chinese shoppers get swept up in the normal Christmas promotions, little attention has been paid to Chinese tourists visiting during the winter months." CBM, a firm that specialises in helping Australian companies sell to Chinese customers, said the second-biggest time for Chinese tourists after Chinese New Year are the school holidays that fall in July and August, forecasting $700 million will be spent during the period in Australia this year.Chinese tourists spent an average of $2,499 per person in Australia in 2015, CBM said."The significance of this holiday season is growing as more and more Chinese become affluent enough to travel, and have jobs offering paid vacation time," the report said.Retail sales in April came in at a relatively weak 0.2 per cent growth, according to figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, as retailers flagged an unseasonably warm winter was impacting sales. In a report last year, the Tourism Research Australia showed China topped the list of high spenders while on holiday in Australia, followed by South Korea, Japan and Taiwan during 2011 to 2013.A high spender is defined as having an average spend of $330 per day or spending $4,200 or more for an entire trip.
