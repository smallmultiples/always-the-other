Federal Labor has savaged senior NT Minister Peter Chandler for failing to read an influential report about the dangers of allowing Chinese interests to take over the Port of Darwin.Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has arrived in the Top End amid the deepening row over the $506 million deal with the Landbridge Group.Defence analysts have raised concerns about links between Landbridge and the Chinese Communist Party. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) has published a report which raises concerns the 99-year lease is a strategic move by China to increase its influence in northern Australia, where the United States already has a military presence.The Northern Territory Government said the decision to allow the lease deal was purely commercial."I think it is an absolute beat-up," NT Infrastructure Minister Peter Chandler said.Mr Chandler was also asked if he had read the ASPI document. "No, I haven't read the report," he replied.Shadow defence minister Stephen Conroy described the process as a "shambles" and indicative of a failed assessment process.He said Mr Chandler's admission was "quite frankly astonishing"."[He] had not done due diligence, didn't know about the links with the PLA. These are basic questions that should have been asked," Senator Conroy told AM."I think it's just embarrassing for Scott Morrison, embarrassing for Prime Minister Turnbull."The ABC understands the deal was raised in Mr Turnbull's bilateral meeting with President Obama earlier this week.Mr Turnbull maintains the Defence Department is satisfied with the lease agreement.Federal Treasurer Scott Morrison has proposed reforms to the process for selling state government-owned assets, following the controversial Port of Darwin deal."There are some consultations talking place at the moment with states and territories in relation to those matters," he said."There are constitutional issues around the sovereignty around particular critical infrastructure assets which are held by states and territories, so it's not something the Commonwealth Government can simply move on unilaterally."Executive director of ASPI, Peter Jennings, has urged the Federal Government not to repeat the process."There are a number of important critical infrastructure decisions that are coming up, including the privatisation of the electricity transmission infrastructure in New South Wales," Mr Jennings told AM."We ought to make sure going forward these issues are given the appropriate consideration at every level of government.""For those who are watching China, well this is just another example of how it is looking to demonstrate its interests and its power on a much wider geographic scale," he said.
