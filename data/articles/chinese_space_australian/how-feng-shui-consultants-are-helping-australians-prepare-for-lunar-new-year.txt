If Valentine's Day is a boom time for florists and the arrival of the Easter bunny pumps money into bakeries, the lead-up to February is richest time for practitioners of the ancient Chinese art of feng shui.Thousands of Australians invite consultants into their homes and businesses before the start of the Lunar New Year to find out how to control the positive and negative influences in their lives by moving furniture, replacing homewares and adjusting colour schemes.Mina Zheng has spent the last decade mapping sources of positive and negative chi within the home of her clients in Sydney. She said Lunar New Year was not just a time to clean and de-clutter your home, but to evaluate how the arrangement of your living and working spaces might affect your relationships, fortunes and health in 2018."When the year changes it affects every individual," she said. "If the year brings a set of good elements to us, our year ahead will be really successful."But, if the element is really destructive to the person then we have to do something to harmonise it to enhance the year."This year will be dominated by the forces of man's best friend — the dog.Ms Zheng said 2018 was likely to bring a mixture of good and bad luck for people depending on the zodiac animal that represents them and where their birth day and year sits on the Chinese astrological calendar.Feng shui consultants use a special compass, or Luopan, to map out the influences affecting a property before separating it into a number of sections.According to feng shui, the impact of each section depends on which of the five elements is active — water, wood, fire, earth or metal.Ms Zheng said the north, north-west, east and north-east sections of the home would harbour negative influences in 2018.Meanwhile, the south-east, west and centre was likely to provide more positive chi."The north has too much earth energy," she said."If there's any red things in this section — pillows or red paintings — we should move them somewhere else."She recommended people swap red, orange or purple coloured objects in northern rooms for metallic colours and white.Brisbane business owner Chiu-Ling Lee has applied feng shui at home and inside her businesses for more than 10 years.She said she believed it made a difference to her life. Placing a water feature on top of a bar fridge in her family's garage was the strangest thing she had done to drive away bad energy.And she admitted her constantly changing decor choices could look unusual to the uninitiated."I do decorate the house according to the year," she said."That's why we do look crazy sometimes." Updating her feng shui this year has been as simple as moving fire-coloured objects from one area of her home to another.Sunshine Coast feng shui master George Bennis said his clients reached out for advice as early as December ahead of the Lunar New Year.He described feng shui as a "mapping system" that monitored changes in chi — an invisible force he said influenced all life on Earth."Everyone has probably been to a house or location and felt really uplifted, inspired and comfortable," he said."Or, conversely, gone to a house where it feels heavy, thick and uncomfortable."If you have ever had that experience then you have felt chi."He said homes or businesses would not end up looking like a Chinese restaurant if feng shui was applied correctly."Hanging red tassel-y things and having statues of dragons and tigers all over the place is totally unnecessary," he said."It should be a red rug over here, a water feature in this corner, a beautiful painting here."
