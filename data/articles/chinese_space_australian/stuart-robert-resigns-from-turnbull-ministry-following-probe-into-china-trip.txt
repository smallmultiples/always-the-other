Stuart Robert is resigning from the Turnbull ministry after an internal investigation revealed he has shares in a trust linked to the mining company of a generous Liberal donor. Labor has been calling for Mr Robert to be sacked over a trip to China in 2014, where he appeared at a signing ceremony for a mining deal between Australian company Nimrod Resources and a Chinese business.The Opposition argued the trip was inappropriate because Nimrod's executive chairman Paul Marks was a generous Liberal Party donor.Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull ordered an internal investigation earlier this week, tasking the Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Martin Parkinson, with considering Mr Robert's actions.  Mr Turnbull has now confirmed the results of the investigation, revealing Mr Robert has now become aware of shares allocated to him in a trust which are related to Nimrod Resources."Dr Parkinson concluded that Mr Robert had acted inconsistently with the Statement of Ministerial Standards, although he accepts that Mr Robert may not have intended to do so," Mr Turnbull said."Mr Robert recognised that this connection would create the impression that at the time he went to Beijing he had something personally to gain from the Nimrod Resources project."As a result, Mr Robert has asked me not to consider him in the pending reshuffle of the ministry."Mr Robert previously said he travelled to China in a personal capacity and not as a Government representative. He said he was confident he did not act inappropriately.The ABC has also been told Mr Robert has routinely used his ministerial office for fundraising events. Mr Roberts responded by saying he uses his office for parliamentary business.The move will add to the complexity of the Prime Minister's reshuffle, which is expected this weekend."Malcolm's dealt with this, you have to give people a chance to get all the details out. You can't just on the first sign of smoke go out and shoot somebody," incoming deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce told 2GB."Find all the details, but once all the details become apparent you've got to say sorry, 'Goodnight Irene'." Labor's main criticism of Stuart Robert centred on the nature of the China trip, and whether the Minister personally benefited from the Nimrod Resources project.Mr Robert maintains he was not aware of any interest or connection to Paul Marks' company when he made the trip in 2014.But during the Parkinson investigation this week Mr Robert checked his records, and said he had become aware of shares allocated to his trustee in a company called Metallum Holdings Pty Ltd.The shares were allocated before the Beijing trip. Mr Marks also held shares in Metallum Holdings and the company had an interest in Nimrod Resources."He told Dr Parkinson that this [the share allocation] had been done without his knowledge," Mr Turnbull's statement said."Mr Robert recognised that this connection would create the impression that at the time he went to Beijing he had something personally to gain from the Nimrod Resources project."He also notes that Mr Robert appears not to have received any financial benefit and that the conduct in question did not directly relate to Mr Robert's ministerial duties."Shadow treasurer Chris Bowen has questioned Mr Turnbull's leadership and said he should have acted earlier."It was clear that Malcolm Turnbull was sneakily trying to get through Parliament and would sack him at the end of the week," Mr Bowen said."Malcolm Turnbull should have acted immediately. He dithered. Malcolm Turnbull is the prime ditherer."The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) yesterday said Chinese officials believed they were meeting Mr Robert in an official capacity when he travelled to Beijing.
