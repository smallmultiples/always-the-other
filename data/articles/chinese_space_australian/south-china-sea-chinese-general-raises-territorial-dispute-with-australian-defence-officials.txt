A Chinese general who vowed to fight for Beijing's sovereignty in the South China Sea has raised the territorial dispute during high-level talks with Defence officials in Canberra.Earlier this week, the outspoken and powerful People's Liberation Army (PLA) General, Wang Jiaocheng, held a series of meetings and talks with Defence Department secretary Dennis Richardson and other senior Australian military officials.The ABC has confirmed the talks included discussions about China's rapid military expansion in the South China Sea, which Australia has regularly expressed concerns about.Security expert Euan Graham from the Lowy Institute says it would likely have been a robust discussion."I think it would always be a rather cagey conversation on the South China Sea in that Australia, I think, will mention it and the quick response from the Chinese side will be predictably one that sees the South China Sea as a concern that is China's," Mr Graham said. Earlier this year, General Wang was placed in charge of the PLA's Southern Theatre Command, which takes in the strategically important South China Sea region.In February, he warned that China was capable of fighting to defend its sovereignty in the waterway â€” a crucial international trade route."The military will be capable of dealing with any security threat," General Wang was quoted as saying in China's People's Daily."No country will be allowed to use any excuse or action to threaten China's sovereignty and safety."The Defence Department is yet to respond to detailed questions from the ABC.This article includes interactive enhancements which are not supported on this platform.For the full interactive experience in this article, you will need a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.
