Australian police rescue experts and Defence Force personnel have arrived in Thailand to assist the search for a group of boys missing in a flooded cave. The soccer team of 12 boys, aged between 11 and 16, along with their 25-year-old coach, entered the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in Chiang Rai on June 23 but no contact has been made with them since.Six AFP Specialist Response Group members, who have search and rescue and cave diving skills, have arrived at Chiang Rai aboard a Royal Australian Air Force C-17 transport aircraft.Australia's foreign affairs, defence and home affairs ministers said in a joint statement late on Saturday that Australia was working closely with the Thai Government and the Royal Thai Army, who are leading the search operation.The ADF has also deployed an official to the rescue command centre in Chiang Rai as a specialist liaison officer to provide operations and planning expertise. A Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officer was also deploying with the AFP rescue team to assist with coordination.Rescuers, including Thai navy divers, a US military team and British cave experts, have been hampered by incessant rain that has flooded the cave.Additional experts from around the world, including two Chinese teams, have also joined the rescue mission.James Wang, a member of the Chinese rescue team Green Boat Emergency Organisation, believed they could help with the operation. "We have the skill to the rescue cave and the skill of SRT, single rope technology. So I think, in this environment we can do something for the children," he said. Another Chinese team has brought underwater drones and 3D imaging, though so far the floodwater has been too murky for it to be effective. The rescue effort has three strands: divers are trying to swim through the flooded caves to search for the missing team; soldiers are looking for fissures that may provide more ways in to the complex, and engineers are pumping out millions of gallons of water.
