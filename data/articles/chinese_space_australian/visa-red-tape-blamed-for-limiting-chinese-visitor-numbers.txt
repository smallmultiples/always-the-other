A tourism lobby group says Queensland is missing out on key opportunities in the Asian market.Latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show Chinese visitation to Australia rose by just over 12 per cent this year, compared to 23 per cent in the United States and more than 30 per cent in Canada.Rowan Barker from the Tourism and Transport Forum says visa regulations are impeding potential growth."At the moment an independent traveller has to pay $130, they need to jump through a lot of administrative hoops, completing a 15 page paper-based application in English and waiting up to 15 days for processing," he said."So our competitors are doing it a lot quicker, a lot simpler and a lot cheaper than that and as a result, Chinese visitors are picking other destinations over Australia."In terms of numbers out of China we're up 12.2 per cent over the year to the end of August and that sounds good and it is pretty good but compared to some of our major competitors we're actually falling behind."So far this year the number of Chinese tourists going to Canada has grown by 30.4 per cent and the US has seen growth of 23 per cent."
