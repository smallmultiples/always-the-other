All commercial flights worldwide could soon send out an automated signal every minute in times of distress to help rescuers find downed aircraft more easily.The new measures are in response to last year's disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in what remains one of history's great aviation mysteries.The aircraft, with 239 people on board, has never been found, nearly a year on.The new tracking rules, prepared by an industry working group, would be phased in by the end of this year, said the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), a United Nations agency.The initiative would be presented to delegates from all 191 ICAO member states at a meeting in Montreal next week, and "a final proposal" would be submitted to the ICAO Council within six months for ratification.The measure has unanimous support among ICAO member states, a source said, meaning it was virtually assured to be brought in.Currently, radar can track a plane, however coverage fades when aircraft are out at sea or the plane is flying below a certain altitude.Under the new rules, airlines would be required to track their aircraft using a system that gives their location at 15-minute intervals.If an "abnormal event" is detected, including a change in direction or deviation from a flight path, the signal rate hastens to every minute.Airlines would be responsible for sharing the data with authorities in cases of emergencies."It's the start of tracking [flights] every minute in emergency situations that is the most effective in the short term," the source said.Following a distress signal, search and rescue teams would be able to zero in on an aircraft within 11 kilometres of its last known position.The ICAO would also ask airlines to equip their aircraft with ejectable black boxes, which would float and be more easily retrievable in case of a crash over water.They would be mandatory on new aircraft built after 2021, the source said.The ejectable black boxes would be in addition to existing commercial flight data recorders and cockpit voice recorders that continually record flight information.Australia has also made requests to ICAO to issue clear guidelines on who should be responsible for searches for missing aircraft once rescue efforts are called off.Australia has led the nearly year-long hunt for the missing MH370.More than two dozen countries have been involved in the air, sea and underwater search for the Boeing 777. The current phase is focused on the sea floor about 1,600 kilometres west of Perth."The potential for difficulties to arise is likely to exist [when an] aircraft is believed to have gone missing in a search and rescue zone that is not the responsibility of the state with the onus to conduct the investigation," Australia said in documents released ahead of the ICAO conference."In the case of MH370, the aircraft was believed to have gone missing in Australia's search and rescue zone but Malaysia had responsibility for the accident investigation [under ICAO rules]."In the event that a similar tragedy happens in the future ... without ICAO guidance, there may be uncertainty on how to proceed."The Australia-based Joint Agency Coordination Center (JACC) is running the search operations which involve Australian, Chinese and Malaysian search equipment.Australia had set aside $80-90 million last year for the search, already the most expensive ever undertaken. Malaysia said it would split the costs.Malaysia declared the flight's disappearance an accident this week, clearing the way for airlines to pay compensation to victims' families.Malaysia said that it, China and Australia remained committed to the search.AFP/Reuters
