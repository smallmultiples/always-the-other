Western Australia's historic mining town of Coolgardie, 550 kilometres east of Perth, was put on the map by one of the world's biggest gold rushes back in 1892. It has seen many fortunes won and lost over the years, but perhaps nothing on a scale quite like WA gold miner Focus Minerals. At one stage, at its peak in 2012, Focus claimed to be Australia's fifth-largest gold producer but saw its costs spiral out of control in what could now be a timely reminder for the sector. In September 2012, at the peak of the mining investment boom, China's Shandong Gold International Mining Corporation bought 51 per cent of the Perth-based miner for $225 million. In the space of a few months, the Chinese company watched their investment implode in spectacular fashion, amid the worst gold price crash since the 1980s. For Shandong, which is part-owned by the Shandong Provincial Government, it was the company's first investment in Australia and one of its biggest outside China.China is the world's biggest gold producer with an estimated 340 tonnes in 2017 and Australia the second-biggest with 301 tonnes for the year, according to Melbourne-based mining analysts Surbiton Associates.But StockAnalysis author and independent analyst Peter Strachan, who has followed the Coolgardie goldfields for the past 20 years, said the same mining investment rationale used successfully in China could not always be applied in Australia. "From the time the Chinese became involved they were looking to expand," he said. "Sitting in Beijing, I think they looked down on this asset and thought 'hey, there's 2.5 million ounces of gold resources and we can buy it for like $20 an ounce in the ground'. "The [low] grades didn't bother them because in China they can mine underground for 1.8 grams per tonne, because the cost of labour is just a little bit cheaper than it is in Australia. "I think there's been a lot of over-eager Chinese money coming down to Australia. You've seen that in the iron ore space and the oil and gas space, and by and large people have been really poorly advised in the way they've moved into assets in Australia."Now some of the banks in China are trying to haul back some of the money that's been leaking out of China into projects around the world — a lot with dubious valuations." Focus was the largest landholder in the Coolgardie gold belt, controlling 450 square kilometres of prospective tenements in an area that had produced more than 2.8 million ounces from 26 mines.  In a letter to shareholders in October 2012, Focus's then-chairman Don Taig described the Shandong deal as a "step change" in the way the company was funded, valued and perceived in the global market.  "There are many examples in the market of previously poor execution by foreign investors and I think Shandong Gold have thought very seriously indeed about the model for success," he said at the time.  The Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) signed off and an independent expert BDO Corporate Finance called the deal "fair and reasonable".  The problem with commodity prices, however, is they can change dramatically overnight. And they did. In September 2012 when the Shandong deal was announced, the Australian dollar gold price was around $1,740 per ounce. By July 2013, it was trading at $1,350 an ounce and hundreds of workers were out of a job as Focus shut its Coolgardie mines and its Laverton operations, 350 kilometres to the north-east.  For Shanghai Stock Exchange-listed Shandong, it meant the Chinese miner would be taking a substantial hit from their first Australian venture. Focus' financial statements claim a total cash loss of $18.5 million between 2013 and 2016, with a non-cash loss of $143.7 million taking into account depreciation, amortisation and impairment costs. Mr Strachan said high labour costs and falling gold prices hit Focus at the worst possible time. "When you're trying to mine four grams per tonne underground and have to pay people $1,300 a shift to do it, that doesn't work out," the analyst said. "I don't think they realised, when they were looking at these assets from afar, the commerciality of it, because through Chinese eyes it looked like they were going to make a lot of money. "But really, the logistics of it made it very difficult to move forward."Gold has since recovered to $US1,306 an ounce, which is about $A1,842, helped by the Australian dollar falling from around parity to near 70 US cents over the period.In Australian dollar terms, it is roughly back where it was when Shandong made the investment in the first place.This week, Focus CEO Zhaoya Wang was "excited" after agreeing in principle to sell the Coolgardie project for $40 million — less than half of what it was valued at in 2012. In fact, BDO Corporate Finance estimated the fair market value of the Coolgardie project to be in the range of $70 million to $110 million, with a preferred value of $85 million.  The sale negotiated with Australian gold miner Intermin Resources, which has a five-month exclusivity period, comprises $31 million cash and $9 million in shares so Mr Wang was "excited" about possibly retaining some exposure.  But to state the obvious, it will take something miraculous for the Chinese investors to recoup their initial outlay. Focus said an October 2017 study valued Coolgardie at $37 million and it considered the sale "in the best interests of all shareholders". Mr Strachan said the $40 million price tag appeared low, compared with the previous valuation. "The valuation on the market is not necessarily what you can walk out onto St George's Terrace [in Perth] and sell it for," he said. "I think they've realised they've made a mistake and they're just trying to take their chips off the table and move on. "I just wish the people that would come down here looking for assets to buy were better advised. "There's always lots of carpet baggers around Australia, entrepreneurs who will happily take a fee and put people into projects that don't really fit." Records show Focus had $10.4 million in the bank when former CEO Campbell Baird orchestrated the September 2012 deal with Shandong.  At that stage, Focus had two underground mines and two open-pit mines at Coolgardie along with the Three Mile Hill processing plant, which had been recommissioned in 2009 and had an estimated replacement value of about $100 million.The bank balance swelled to $225.8 million in the December 2012 quarter following receipt of the Shandong cash, but things went pear-shaped rather quickly.It was costing Focus $1,893 an ounce to mine the precious metal in the March 2013 quarter — so with gold trading around $1,350 an ounce they were losing money every time a shovel dug into the ground. Most agree Focus' new-look board with four Shandong seats had only one choice — to shut down.Once the decision to close the mines was made, the extent of the damage to the company's "war chest" was revealed. They had haemorrhaged more than $120 million but still had $116.7 million in the bank as at September 30, 2013.Over the past few years, Focus has spent millions more on exploration drilling, paying rent on its landholdings and a feasibility study on a possible restart at Coolgardie — likely to cost $53 million.  The coffers, according to Focus's latest filings with the ASX, are down to just $42.5 million.The miner has stated it is now focused on "progressing" its mothballed gold mines at Laverton, which were valued at $34 million by BDO in 2012.  The question now is whether it will be a case of once bitten, twice shy, or will Focus restart their Laverton mines or sell like Coolgardie?And given the success other Chinese miners Norton Gold Fields and Minjar Gold have enjoyed in WA, having another crack at mining is not out of the question for Focus.Focus said it still considered Australia to be a safe mining and investment destination. "The whole of the Focus board's view is that Australia has high-quality and low-cost gold assets," the company said in a statement. "The Australian gold price has been very bullish."Western Australia has been ranked one of the top jurisdictions in the world for investment by the Fraser Institute."Shandong's troubles have certainly not put off other Chinese investors, though it is a cautionary tale among mining executives. The latest FIRB figures show China is Australia's biggest source of overseas investment, sinking $7.3 billion into mineral exploration and development in the 2016-17 financial year. Mr Strachan said the Shandong investment in Focus was unlikely to scare off foreign investment in the Australian resources sector, but the pace of Chinese investment seemed to be slowing."This is peanuts compared to what the Chinese companies have lost in iron ore," he said."In terms of future money, Chinese money has basically evaporated."It's a bit like the Japanese in the 1980s — there was so much money coming out of Japan they were just buying everything and anything, and it all ended really badly for them in the 1990s because the value of the assets they bought fell away."There's not a lot of new Chinese money looking to make its way into projects in Australia, even the property spruikers, the property developers, well-known political donors, have had to basically sell their assets and try again."I don't think we're going to see a flight of more Chinese money coming in."Editor's note (8/3/18): This story has been amended to include more details from Focus Minerals' financial statements with comment from the company in response to the story. The story has been changed to clarify the ownership of the company and when the losses were incurred. Comment from independent financial analyst Peter Strachan has also been added.
