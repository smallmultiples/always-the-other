The sacking of the ABC managing director Michelle Guthrie has brought her often challenging, sometimes tumultuous, two-year tenure at the top of the national broadcaster to an end.Her appointment to the position in 2016 was met with considerable surprise by many in the industry, who didn't consider her one of the names on the short list.But that surprise was nothing compared to the astonishment engendered by her departure.Ms Guthrie joined the ABC as managing director after an extensive search to find a successor to Mark Scott, whose 10 years at the helm marked a period of stability and expansion for the national broadcaster. Under his watch, the ABC introduced News 24 (now the News Channel), iView and developed its digital strategy. Mr Scott, who was widely respected for his forceful advocacy of the national broadcaster, used one of his last interviews as managing director to identify a need for greater diversity at the ABC.It was an issue that Ms Guthrie took up with gusto, sending an email to staff on her first day on the job calling for greater representation of women and multicultural communities in both the ABC's staff and its stories.The daughter of a Chinese mother and an Australian father — and the first female managing director in the ABC's history — her appointment marked a departure from the long list of white males who preceded her.Before joining the ABC, Ms Guthrie's career included stints as an executive at News Corporation's Foxtel, and Asian satellite service Star TV. Her background in commercial media, and lack of experience in broadcast journalism, gave rise to concern that her appointment would lead to a covert introduction of Rupert Murdoch's culture at the national broadcaster.Her mission as managing director, as she saw it, was to ensure the national broadcaster's longevity for future generations."I wanted the ABC to be as meaningful and relevant to my children and their children as it has been to me during my lifetime," she told the audience at ABC's first annual public meeting last February.She also sought to position ABC content at the centre of how the organisation invested in its future.The $50m Great Ideas Grant, announced by Ms Guthrie in 2017, became a new content fund to finance staff members' ideas outside the traditional process.In a statement issued after her sacking, she made it clear she saw that legacy as one of her signature achievements as managing director."To me, it is the content produced by the ABC that is of primary importance to Australians, with the technology used to deliver that content a distant second," she wrote."In the first two years of my five-year term, I have invested more in investigative journalism; more in regional journalism; more in innovative content; and increased the efficiency and effectiveness of work across the ABC."But others have a different view of Ms Guthrie's legacy.Chief among her critics' concerns was the issue of how she managed the key relationship with the Federal Government.The challenges are nothing new — the ABC has always received pressure from the government of the day over its news coverage.Multiple editorial complaints were lodged by the Prime Minister's Office and by Communications Minister Mitch Fifield during Ms Guthrie's tenure.There was also pressure from the external commentariat, with Ms Guthrie regularly finding herself receiving robust criticism from newspaper columnists and radio talk-back hosts, as well as media moguls who believe the ABC is encroaching on commercial enterprise.Last June, she took these criticisms to task, arguing the ABC had become "a punching bag by narrow political, commercial or ideological interests" during a speech to the Melbourne Press Club.At that gathering of journalists, broadcast live across the nation, her own employees made their criticisms publicly known."We are hopeless at telling our own story as an organisation and we have a managing director who has been deliberately and, she says, strategically silent," ABC Radio presenter Jon Faine argued."Well, that's not worked."Ms Guthrie was also taken to task by the public sector union, the CPSU, which said her planned re-structuring of the corporation risked contributing to increased stress levels for staff.But worst of all was the apprehension from within the ABC itself that her faltering relationship with the Federal Government was affecting the ABC's bottom line.Some fear it played a role in the Government's 2018 budget decision to freeze the ABC's indexation, costing the broadcaster $84m over three years.By her own admission, Ms Guthrie has never enjoyed the public spotlight.In contrast to her predecessor, who was a tireless public advocate, Ms Guthrie felt her strength was achieving results quietly."I understand that there is a lot of curiosity about me but I'm not sure that I feel entirely comfortable in being as public as I have to be," she told One Plus One in 2017.It was unfortunate for her that it was not a style of leadership the ABC Board wanted.Now she makes her exit from one of the country's most important media roles, in circumstances which attract the full glare of the public's attention.
