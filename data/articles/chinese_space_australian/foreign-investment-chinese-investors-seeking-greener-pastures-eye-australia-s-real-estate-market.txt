Hanya Federal had a prominent location for its booth at an overseas property exhibition in Beijing — right in front of the entrance of the exhibition hall.A display model of the company's pride and joy, its first development in the Melbourne suburb of Box Hill, was positioned at the front for all to inspect.The company's chief operating officer, David Wang, was expecting 7,000 to 8,000 people to come to the exhibition over a three-day period."Many people open their eyes in amazement after listening to our presentation about the Australian real estate market," Mr Wang said."Perhaps it's because they compare it with the situation in China — the land is not free hold, the quality of the apartment isn't as good either."Chinese investors are looking for better returns outside the country in part because they have limited options on the mainland.China's real estate sector — which accounts for between 16 to 25 per cent of the country's GDP — has produced some of the country's richest men, but is still cooling along with the rest of the economy.Official figures from the Chinese bureau of statistics show new home sales in the first two months of this year are down by 17 per cent from a year ago across the country.Property prices also fell in 66 out of 70 cities surveyed.Mi Jia is one local investor considering selling some of his properties in the Chinese capital as he sees little room for growth.He is following the same path as Hong Kong's richest man, Li Kashing, who has been cutting his exposure to real estate in Hong Kong and mainland China over the past few years while buying blue chip companies in Britain, Australia and Europe."Hong Kong's richest man Li Kashing is also investing in Europe in a big way that's why I pay attention to the market there," Mr Mi said."I think their property market is undervalued."Others who turned up said they were considering buying property overseas so that their children would have a home away from home while studying abroad.Education is an aspect of life that matters acutely to many Chinese. Mr Wang said, in some instances, parents were choosing to invest in Australian property while their children were young because as of March last year, Chinese students can enrol in Australian schools from year seven instead of year 10.Promoters selling properties in Australia and the United States hit all the right buttons as they advertised their services to a small attentive audience."I studied in Australia for six years," said a broker during his presentation."Rent alone cost one third of my entire education. Rent was a huge expense. I didn't know any better that's why I wasted my father's money on rent."Another who was promoting properties in Seattle said it would be easier for children to qualify for a spot at a good American university with a green card compared to a foreigner.According to Ning Yi, an immigration consultant present at the exhibition, the United States is the preferred destination for his clients, followed by Europe.The US, Australia, New Zealand and some European countries have introduced investor immigration schemes to draw capital from wealthy individuals, attracting a significant number of mainland Chinese in the process.Mr Ning said European countries like Cyprus, Portugal, Spain and Italy were some of the European countries that had started promoting themselves in a big way over the past few years."Their economy has not been doing well in recent years," said Mr Ning."In other words so long as you have the money to buy their property and don't have a criminal record in China then it's not a problem."Mainland Chinese form the majority of people who receive US investor visas and more of them are applying for it.In a recent report on Chinese international migration prepared by the Centre for China and Globalisation and the state-backed Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, 9,128 Chinese received the US investor visa last year.This is a 46 per cent increase compared to 2013.Not everyone is following in the same footsteps — Hong Kong and Canada have either scrapped or suspended their investor immigration schemes.In Australia, claims that foreigners were driving up property prices prompted the Government to propose an application fee on potential buyers.Properties below $1 million would attract a fee of $5,000; those above $1 million would attract a fee of $10,000 for every million above the purchase price.The application fee would be paid to the Foreign Investment Review Board.Real estate companies like Hanya Federal are prepared to absorb a significant proportion of that extra cost if it is imposed."We may have to reduce our selling price by $2,000 to $3,000 or reimburse our customers in another way," Mr Wang said."But it's not something we are considering at the moment."
