Escalating fears about the Chinese share market rout have driven Wall Street sharply lower, with iron ore prices slumping to a decade low.The Chinese benchmark price for the metal fell more than 11 per cent overnight to $US44.10 a tonne; the price has dropped 25 per cent since the start of the month.David Bryant, the head of investments at Australian Unity, says the Chinese share market's pain is feeding through to commodity prices."If the Chinese government needs to use its resources to shore up the share market, the work that it has been doing in supporting jobs and construction will be more limited, so as a result there will be less building and there will be less demand for our commodities like iron ore and copper," he explained.In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5 per cent, or 261 points, to 17,515, while the broader S&P 500 lost nearly 1.7 per cent (35 points) to 2,047.That is still only a fraction of the Shanghai stock exchange's drop of nearly 6 per cent yesterday, and more than 30 per cent in the past four weeks.It was not only Chinese fears that drove Wall Street anxiety though.A computer malfunction has been blamed for shutting the New York Stock Exchange for more than three hours.The operators of the exchange - which includes the Dow Jones and S&P 500 â€“ were quick to rule out suggestions of a cyber attack by hackers."The issue we are experiencing is an internal technical issue and is not the result of a cyber breach," the exchange said through the official NYSE Twitter account.The release of the minutes from the US Federal Reserve's June policy meeting had surprisingly little impact, despite revealing the central bank is not yet convinced it is time to start raising interest rates."Most participants judged that the conditions for policy firming had not yet been achieved; a number of them cautioned against a premature decision," the minutes revealed."Many participants emphasised that, in order to determine that the criteria for beginning policy normalisation had been met, they would need additional information indicating that economic growth was strengthening, that labour market conditions were continuing to improve, and that inflation was moving back toward the committee's objective."Across the Atlantic, traders finally ended their Greek-debt fuelled sell-off, despite there still being no resolution to the crisis.The Euro Stoxx index added 1 per cent (33 points) to 3,328 and Germany's DAX rose 0.7 per cent (71 points) to 10,747.The FTSE 100 in London gained 0.9 per cent (58 points) to 6,491 and its Italian stable-mate, the FTSE MIB, jumped 2.6 per cent (554 points) to close at 21,512.Futures trade suggests the local share market will open lower, adding to yesterday's heavy losses, though China's market is again likely to influence its direction.The ASX SPI 200 was 31 points, or 0.6 per cent, lower at 5,370 at 8:00am (AEST).At the same time, the Australian dollar was buying around 74.2 US cents, 67 euro cents, 48.3 British pence and 89.5 Japanese yen.West Texas crude oil slipped just over 1 per cent overnight to $US51.56 a barrel.But spot gold was up a little at $US1,158 an ounce.
