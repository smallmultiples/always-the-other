Analysts say Chinese influence over some media outlets in Australia is growing, with evidence some sensitive issues, like the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, are increasingly being omitted from many Chinese language newspapers and radio stations.Professor John Fitzgerald from Swinburne University said he bought 18 Chinese language newspapers in Melbourne during the week of the Tiananmen Square anniversary, between June 2 and June 8."Of those 18 titles, 11... made no mention whatsoever of the fact this happened to be the 25th anniversary," he said.Two of the seven papers that did report the anniversary were associated with Falun Gong, a religious movement the Chinese Communist Party wants to eradicate.At least one other is associated with the Taiwanese community.Professor Fitzgerald said the findings seemed to prove Beijing has influence over editorial decisions."What's exceptional here is not that China's engaged with the 1 million Chinese Australians, but that it's controlling what appears to be the majority of the Chinese language media in this country", he said."Behind this strategic media policy sits a state, behind that state sits perhaps the most powerful organisation in the world, the Chinese Communist Party."The Chinese Communist Party has long felt unfairly represented in the Western media.New Zealand author James To, who wrote a book on state media influence, told AM it is a global phenomenon."At this stage we can just look at the Hong Kong protests. Looking at New Zealand [Chinese language] media in particular it appears that there hasn't been much coverage of what's going on with the pro-democracy movement," Mr To said."What the Chinese state media has done is they've formed networks or joint ventures with local media companies. So there is a lot of reprinting of stories from state media ... or broadcasts on radio."These organisations are then invited to join umbrella organisations in China, for example the World [Chinese] Media Forum."This sets the direction, or influences, the content of overseas Chinese newspapers."For decades China has been trying to improve its image abroad and reach out to Chinese migrants.Mr To said state influence was strongest in free "advertorial style" publications, and he had found many Chinese migrants, or students, enjoyed the coverage."It makes them feel reconnected to the motherland. So, for most purposes this is actually totally benign and for the target market at least this is seen as a very positive thing," he said."I guess when it gets to be something which might be a little more of a concern is when political overtones start taking precedent."What I mean by that is what is covered or not covered or in some cases attacked."He and other analysts agree China's "soft power" push has gathered pace since the Beijing Olympics and is likely to get more attention in countries like Australia as China's power grows."Until now China has not had the capacity to get its own voice outside and the Western media has been dominating," Professor Wanning Sun from Sydney's University of Technology said."Many in China think it is now their chance to tell their story to the world."But Professor Sun told AM Chinese migrants were very media savvy and sceptical of what they read."That is because people in China have actually lived with propaganda, they have this political culture where ... they read between the lines and there is some kind of inbuilt immune system if you like," she said.
