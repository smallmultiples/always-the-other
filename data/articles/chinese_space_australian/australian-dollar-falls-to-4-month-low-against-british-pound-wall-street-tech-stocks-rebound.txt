The Australian dollar hit its lowest level in more than four months against the British pound overnight.It dropped by a sharp 0.6 per cent to 54.6 British pence, and fell slightly to 61.3 Euro cents.

I think it is possible."But, he said, a major sticking point remained around managing the Irish border, where Brussels has said London's proposals to avoid undermining either peace in Northern Ireland or the EU's single-market regulations had so far been unrealistic.The sterling surged as a result, amid renewed optimism among investors.The local currency rose slightly to 71.1 US cents, but remained at its lowest level in more than two years.The Australian dollar is seen as a proxy for Chinese growth, as China is Australia's largest trading partner.Copper, an industrial metal China uses heavily, fell 0.7 per cent overnight.
