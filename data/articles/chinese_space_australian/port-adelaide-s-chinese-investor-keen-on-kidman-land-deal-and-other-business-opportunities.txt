Port Adelaide Football Club's landmark deal with a Shanghai investor may have political undertones and be a stepping stone to other business deals, experts have said.The multi-million-dollar deal with a Chinese real estate company will see Power games broadcast in China, training camps in Shanghai and even a premiership season game played in the country.The same investor is part of a consortium trying to buy the Kidman cattle stations in the Australian outback.Adelaide University's head of Asian Studies Dr Gerry Groot said businessman Gui Goujie may see his stake in Port Adelaide as a useful step toward bigger investments."If he does become the owner of the Kidman properties, and he's a clear supporter of the Australian football culture, that would go a long way I think to muting criticism of that sort of purchase," Dr Groot said."As we know, land purchases in Australia are very political."He also said there was a huge potential for football to break into the Chinese market given the country's interest in contact sports."The cultural gap there is pretty big. Many Chinese mothers would see the way Australian rules is played and be shocked, and not want their children to have any part of such a thing."But interest in contact sports like rugby, and even American gridiron, is slowly increasing."Professor Mobo Gao, from the Confucius Institute at the University of Adelaide, agreed there was potential for the investor to use the deal as a stepping stone towards other deals he would like to make in Australia."They might want to know more about Australia, to get them familiar with Australia, and to have a good relations with Australia, but as a business of course they want to find investment opportunities," Professor Gao said.IG Markets analyst Angus Nicholson said the deal was about building relationships and brand awareness."There isn't a great awareness of AFL in China at the moment," he said.Mr Nicholson said in China investing in sports teams was a way to connect with political leaders.He said the company had diverse interests including hotels in China and a golf course in New Zealand, and adding Australian farmland would "make sense" given long-term market forecasts.
