A man accused of manufacturing 3D printed guns is a fan of science fiction who let his hobby get "out of hand", a Sydney court has heard.Sicen Sun, 27, an account manager for an advertising agency, was arrested yesterday when detectives searched his Waverley unit in Sydney's east, following a tip-off.Officers found four imitation pistols, including 3D-manufactured semi-automatic Glock pistols and a 3D-manufactured Sig pistol, two air pistols, computer equipment and two 3D printers.Sun was arrested and charged with various offences relating to the manufacture of firearms using a 3D printer.At a bail hearing at Waverley Local Court this morning Sun's solicitor, Jason Keane, said his client was a science fiction fan who got carried away with his hobby and wanted to imitate the weapons from police shows such as NCIS and video games like Call of Duty. "He has a fanboy relationship with war gaming, science fiction and police shows," Mr Keane said."He's been hammered by the pointy end of the firearms act."He is captured by provisions clearly designed to target more serious activity."But prosecutors opposed bail, arguing Sun had not shown cause why he should be released on such serious charges."Simply saying he is a fanboy of science fiction, reads comic books or being a nerd doesn't show cause," the prosecutor argued.Sun was granted bail on the condition he surrender his Australian and Chinese passports.New South Wales police said it was the first time police had laid a charge of its type in the state. Detective Inspector Joe Doueihi said police were tipped off after Sun allegedly tried to sell a gun on social media."It's the first time that the NSW Police have charged someone with the offence of possessing blueprints to manufacture firearms," he said."It is of great concern that the equipment is out there. I guess it's up to the individual and if someone does decide to take that action and use a 3D printer to commit a criminal offence, well they do that at their own peril.""It's a serious criminal offence. It holds [a sentence of] 20 years' imprisonment."Sun will face court again in April.NSW Police Commissioner, Andrew Scipione, warned his interstate counterparts about the technology in 2013. He showed a video of one of the weapons being fired and its barrel exploding upwards.
