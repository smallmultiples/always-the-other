No matter how good a deal the Australian government negotiates with China, it will only work if Australian companies seize the opportunities, writes Kerry Brown.When two countries have been negotiating a trade deal for the better part of a decade it is not surprising that everyone starts getting excited when the end comes in sight. Symbolically, a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Australia and its largest trading partner, China, is a big deal, especially as all the indicators show that with the right support, economic links between the two countries are only likely to get bigger and more diverse.Despite the excitement of the moment and what has been achieved, however, we have to remember what an FTA is, and what it can and can't do. An FTA is a deal that sets out clearer rules for a game. Before, no one was too clear on what did and did not figure as a penalty, a violation or a sending off offence. Once an FTA is in place there are clearer boundaries about the permissible and impermissible, and some sense of an external refereeing process. An FTA in theory makes it clearer what constitutes fair and unfair play and makes a better quality game possible.But just like in sports or games, FTAs by themselves don't dictate who wins and loses. That is dependent on how well those taking part play. Good FTAs support better quality competition by supplying a level playing field. So for China and Australia, what they have agreed in effect is a framework for how they trade and invest and economically co-operate with each other better into the future. It is only the start of the real action, not the endpoint, a bit like the moment when the gun goes and both sides can start competing more energetically in a race.Despite the advantages of Australian companies using Renminbi rather than US dollars to trade with Chinese partners, there is still only modest take up. The good news for Australia is that now is the right time to sign a deal. China is relatively new to bilateral FTAs, with only relatively smaller economies like Iceland, Switzerland and New Zealand already completed. It is not in China's broader interests to puts its signature to an agreement that would be perceived by others as one-sided and predatory. Australia is only part of a broader international picture here, and it is likely that it is in China's interests for an agreement, however tough, to be a fair one.It is also a time when China, in its phase of more intense reform and development, does need value-added partnerships, and Australia is well placed to take part in this, not just as a resource supplier but also an intellectual partner. There are already dense interlinks and more diverse forms of engagement. The FTA should help take things to another level, and make the relationship more strategic and stable.Even if the consensus is that the Australian government negotiated a good deal, there is one crucial element that it can't control - and that is the involvement of companies once the ink is dry on the agreement. In the end, they are the ones that will have to work within the FTA in order to get more market share in China, better quality investment here, and more valuable partnerships. Australia signed a good Chinese currency settlement and trading deal in China in 2013, but surveys in the last year have shown that despite the advantages of Australian companies using Renminbi rather than US dollars to trade with Chinese partners, there is still only modest take up.For sure, the Australian government can educate Australian businesses about the Chinese opportunities that might be safer to engage with under an FTA, and to propagate its value, but the final work has to be done by enterprises. They are in a sense the foot soldiers in this benign economic battle. Without their involvement, Australia could sign off on the best deal in the world on paper, but it would be to no avail. We should congratulate the governments of China and Australia for reaching a deal, and pause to pat everyone on the back. The greatest problem now is complacency from a sense that the FTA is an end in itself. This is wrong. The FTA, even after so many years of gruelling negotiation, is in fact only the start.

That of course wont be the end of it as our dollar is now falling because of falling export prices, so expect all imports to start going up in price as well, The only outcome we can expect is a  lower standard of living, which you will just blame on the poor as usual.There is nothing good in these free trade agreements, they will reduce us to being just another third world economy.You should be smart enough to realise that, unless you think we are suddenly going to start farming the Simpson dessert.

10 Nov 2014 9:53:55pmHmm my dad said nothing good came from Melbourne. So far, every FTA signed by the coalition has surrendered significant sovereignty, the US one being the worst. We have few tariffs to reduce, so what do we trade? Our right to make laws? The new US one will demand that. Th right to be sued for regulations? The US are good at that one too. FTA negotiators seem to me to be dimwits.

Canada has paid more than $160 million in fines already and is facing another $4-5-billion worth of NAFTA lawsuits, including one from Lone Pine Resources, which is seeking $250-million compensation for Quebec?s publicly supported moratorium on fracking in the St. Lawrence River Valley.Under TPP, Australia will be sued for billions because we are stopping fracking on our best farmland ( "Lock the Gate"). We will be sued if we ban any medication that causes heart attacks (like the arthritis drugs). We will be sued if we ban the neonics which kill the bees.Our govt will be powerless to do anything to protect the voters.

11 Nov 2014 1:53:25pm@Peter of MelbourneIf there's one thing worse than party politics, it's holier-than-thou, know-it-all's who think that they know better than all sides and that they're free to reign down judgement from their moral high horse while never actually having to provide real world answers or ever admitting when they got it wrong. You're just too in love with your own smug sense of self righteousness to ever see that the answers you provide are just echoes in an empty chamber and devoid of ever having to cope with the sort of real world factors that would make or break a real solution to a problem.Really you people are the narcissistic hipsters of politics and a major part of the problem - no solution offered will ever be good enough for you and hence as the number of those who think like you increase democracies become increasing ungovernable. In essence you're worse than the greens - with them at least the echo chamber is the size of their minority party rather than the size of their own head.Now as for FTA's - they can be good, they can be bad. John Howard sold us out with the US one and this looks like another rushed policy designed to get some publicity for the LNP without thought to the consequences for all Australians.That said it will take many months to see exactly how it will play out in real terms - in the end the good may outweigh the bad and at the very least China seeking these sorts of agreements represents them being willing to play ball in terms of global economics.I do think if we're to maximize the benefits afforded by this FTA though we need to do something similar to what China has done with Australia - get people with experience studying the place and train up our business people in how best to deal with the law, culture, politics and other factors that will mean the difference between success and failure. China has done this on a massive scale with Australia and we need to step up to the plate - teaching more people the language is part of the solution but we need to go further than that, indeed it would be optimal to have education and training tailored to specific industries and to specific parts of this very large and variable country. Providing this as a free or at least subsidized service to Australian business would be a big step forwards in my opinion.

I suggest you & a few pollies actually read some of the articles. Whilst some are a waste most are a good cross section of potential problems that may arise & be left unprotected in the race to get a signatured agreement.Pay for a fact finding trip? Didn't we just pay for Mr Abbott & about 200 of his closest friends to study Asia?  Many camera crews featured him working hard on the back of a push bike.Its too late for training if that moments here.  Fortunately, we are dealing with a country who unlike Australia does value free education & small businesses & has encouraged English language studies as any internet purchaser that has emailed their vendor knows.  One of my questions (other than the obvious photo opportunity & travel) is why we need a hyped up FTA.  China's already buying our milk in bucket loads (tariffs or not) and many other products.  Australia is buying through Ebay ali baba etc etc products from China.  If now China wants cows its just another sales contract.

10 Nov 2014 4:50:55pmWell written. As with the NZ FTA this FTA will set a timetable for full tariff free trade, generally six years. This will give both sides plenty of time to develop businesses based on a full free trade arrangement. However as seen from the NZ side there will be plenty of complicated hurdles in many areas on the Chinese side. Proper interpretation of the FTA threw Chinese CNCA, AQSIQ and customs will at best be sporadic and many years of trial, error, loses for some, political intervention and patience to see all of the agreement finally reach full implementation. Examples of this can be seen today where it is relatively easy to register new retail packed seafood products threw Guangzhou port, but virtually impossible threw Shanghai, even though the same rules apply nationally.

10 Nov 2014 11:33:36pmThat did seem na?ve.And to suggest that China lacked experience in FTAs and wanted to make a good impression.The opposite is true, that whatever concessions Australia negotiates, every country thereafter will want at least that much, and more.
Alert moderator
10 Nov 2014 5:07:37pmMost free trade agreements only help big corporations.The deal with China will most likely see Australian jobs suffering as we tend to only export bulk without value adding. If they are also allowed to bring in Chinese labour for any big project they plan then what is the point of calling it 'investment'. Mining is the main area and that leaves Australia with a degraded environment so if all the equipment and labour comes from China then what benefits to we get? All those costs are tax expenses and add a few dodgy 'loans' from off shore mobs and we get no income tax either.
Alert moderator
10 Nov 2014 5:43:36pmThe FTA will allow Australia to become a lot more competitive in many value added products, especially food. China is experiencing a boom in imported retail packed food stuffs and this is an area which will underpin a lot of jobs in Australia, provided Australian companies, especially the smaller ones can get a grip into the Chinese market. Taking the time to understand the Chinese market and finding a good local partner is the key.....
Alert moderator
10 Nov 2014 8:47:15pmRichardWe can't even successfully compete with the Chinese in producing food for our own country. How will we all of a sudden become competitive in displacing their farmers? Will the Chinese government allow that to happen?

11 Nov 2014 1:56:59pmGPENot sure if you know anything about Chinese consumers at all, there are four classes, Rich, Middle income, blue collar and the poor. I live in Shanghai and have done for seven years, I am a food importer with suppliers in Australia, NZ and Europe and over the last seven years I have seen a huge shift in food consumption habits. Yes some food is exported from China, but it is for sure not a growth industry in China. Simply there is not enough food production within China to feed the nation. Why do you think Australia and NZ beef and lamb exports have skyrocketed in the last two years? Now fish products are starting to increase, as will many value added products from Australia. I see this daily in the supermarkets in China. There was never any good butchers in China two years ago, now they are popping up everywhere, buts its not only meat they sell, all manner of imported foods and sales are brisk. The rich and middle income are the buyers and they make up about 30% of the population and growing, that's about 400 million and guess what, they are prepared to pay a premium for imported food.

10 Nov 2014 7:19:22pmYes and no.  Labor did a lot of groundwork for the  FTA and deserve some credit which I am sure Abbott will be happy to repeat.  If only to take some of the politics out of the issue.  I'd be surprised if all Labor MPs and senators could maintain a disciplined approach, they wouldn't be able to leave politics out of it (nor would some Coalition politicians).  There is a sizable rump in the left that do not believe in free trade and a lot of protectionists on the right who will only want the benefits that accrue to their electorates and will bitch long and hard about the rest (I imagine Bob Katter is resting his vocal chords right now in preparation).  I don't know that Labor will have to prompt the usual suspects to howl at the moon if an FTA is reached - any change is automatically argued to be negative and, dare I say it, neoliberal by people who struggle with economics.  The commentary on The Drum will be overwhelmingly negative I expect.

10 Nov 2014 8:58:24pmProf Brown, there cannot possibly be a level playing field when the domestic currencies of the two trading partners have very different values.Australian trade enthusiasts have repeatedly made the mistake of thinking that the free trade agreements are about market access. For the corporations who are admitted to the negotiating table, it is more about tax avoidance. For the US, it is about intellectual property ? rents that we have to pay them for their bright ideas. For China, it will be about the government surrendering its right to refuse Chinese takeover of Australian companies.Market access for goods and services is a secondary consideration. But even there, our trade advocates always seem filled with optimism about the new openings for Australian products. They forget that the other party is likely to win at least as many openings for their exports to us. We are set to be dudded again.

10 Nov 2014 10:01:43pmUnder a FTA with China, to what extent will Chinese workers be allowed to enter, and take jobs that could be done by unemployed Australians, and at what pay rates ?. Will Australian unions be denied access to these sites?. Will Australian manufacturers be denied access to supplying materials for infrastructure projects financed by the Chinese ?.These and many other questions effecting how an FTA will effect Australian trade with China including agriculture, manufacturing, education and commerce, remain to be seen. Will the agreement be less advantageous than the Chinese NZ - FTA ?.One big reason for my queries are that  the negotiations are being carried out in almost complete secrecy. I certainly hope that my concerns will prove to be groundless.

Australia is in a drought at the moment, the national herd numbers are down, and we'll be exporting this number.  Will this livestock be for Chinese consumption or building up a Chinese national herd?  If it is the latter, how long before we start importing beef from China and at what cost?

11 Nov 2014 1:11:02amIs it just me or is the concept of free trade agreements very ironic? The goal of a FTA is to free trade in an effort to increase trade between two states, but because it becomes easier to trade between these two states they are in effect making it harder (in a relative sense) for every other state to trade with the signatories of any such agreement, thus reducing free trade (while simultaneously not protecting your own industry). For example the EU can be seen as a giant FTA zone, but because Germany happens to be in the EU and exports cars to other members don't need to worry about a tariff, then if GM wanted to start selling Commodores made in Australia to the UK for example, they would be competing against the German cars while having to consider the tariff, hardly a case of free trade if I do say so myself.I'm not necessarily against any particular FTA deal, but really just call it what it is, a preferential trade deal, we make it easier to do certain types of trade here for you if you make it easier to do certain types of trade there for us i.e. give preferential treatment.

11 Nov 2014 8:58:21amTalk about a bunch of "glass half empty" types in these comments.  I think it's mainly due to sour grapes that the Coalition has again managed to secure what the previous Labor government could not.It should come as a surprise to the whingeing lefties on this site that Australia, under the Coalition, is open again for business.FTA's benefit both parties to at least some extent.  If they didn't, one or both parties would not sign.  The longer term benefits will come from the relationships developed between businesses from both countries, as trade continues to broaden over time.  This latest FTA with China (from all reports) will be just the tonic for Australia's northern farmers, especially after the extreme damage done to them by the Gillard government in cancelling the Indonesian live cattle trade.  It's about time a government looked after our primary industry small businesses, instead of bowing to politically correct Green movements, and trying to close them down..

11 Nov 2014 9:02:02amIf we are going to be exporting one million beef a year and there is a shortage through drought etc ,after our commitment is fulfilled, will we pay extra prices for our beef in the supermarkets. The same that is going to happen to our gas because of the export of gas.

11 Nov 2014 9:19:34amPersonally, I don't mind paying a little extra for good quality Australian beef, if it means the hard working producer makes a little more out of it.  The major supermarket chains in this country have squeezed the primary producers margins for far too long.  But, I know the inner-city latte sippers will squeal like stuck pigs if they have to pay a cent more.

11 Nov 2014 9:41:27amIf this FTA is anything like the one with the USA then we will be the losers.I think Senator Heffernan LNP has made some very valid points about currency values & that China's currency can be adjusted at the whim of the Chinese Govt. that could work very badly against Australia.I also feel that we tend to end up buying these FTA deals by giving away far more than we win, just so we can say we have a FTA deal with such & such a country.Apparently the Productivity Commission has said that all the recent FTA deals we have negotiated, Australia has generally been the loser, so why would this one be any different.

11 Nov 2014 11:01:00amSome great photos coming out of the 2014 Star Trek convention in Beijing, particularly of Abbott and Putin. Abbott of course, not really being the science type shouldn't be wearing a blue tunic, maybe a fluoro version.So what happened to Tony, cat bite his tongue? Has he forgotten how to shirt-front since your Oxford days?Or is it because Putin is a man and not a woman?

11 Nov 2014 11:03:30amThree years ago Tony Abbott (as Opposition leader) was all for downplaying the possibility of a FTA with China. The one we were planning to sign was inferior to those we should be making with places like Japan, as China is not a 'market economy'. Now, the Libs are riding high on that deal, mostly brokered by the ALP. Isn't there a name for someone who condemns something, then comes along after all the heavy lifting and takes all the glory for themselves? Perhaps it should be 'a bishop', as in: "Stayed at work till 8pm all week and all day Saturday. But when it went to the Board, the boss just pulled a bishop on me".

11 Nov 2014 1:31:03pmA few of our large mining companies and foreign owned local operations should make some sweet dollars ripping bulk resources out of the country. Maybe if we then let the Chinese buy mass chunks of our farming land, mines and ports we can get on a level playing field with their workers and enjoy the great benefits..

11 Nov 2014 2:18:55pmMany Australians  have the dream of turning the dry interior into productive pasture with huge engineering schemes .  It would be a good thing for Australia if the trade agreement would allow Chinese capital to be used to finance these schemes and allow Australia develop to its full potential .

11 Nov 2014 2:30:07pmWithin 2 mins of the Abbott govt being in power our $ which was on parity with the US $ is now worth 80c on the international market.  When our farmers sell their cattle at approx. $3 a kg it is actually only a return of $2.40 in international monetary terms.  To be able to actually meet the cattle numbers required (are there penalties if the don't?) I've no doubt they will need to borrow $ (currently that money is coming from overseas) at interest rates that will only go up from here (past trends for the Libs low $ & high interest rate).  What happens when China decides in a free market it wants to go somewhere else?  We will have a whole lot of farmers still paying high interest loans for their expansion selling off their product at bargain basement price rather than shooting them.  Sounds like the perfect recipe for a whole lot of farmers having to sell their farms off to the highest bidder & at the moment that seems to be overseas investors.From small business currently failing to compete because of another winner deal the Abbott govt made where pathetic postal delivery charges where given to China yet they still pay top $ at Australia Post it may be a winner.  Now they can sell all their product to China & get it sold back at a profit to consumers & no postage.From the big city point of view pick a supermarket any supermarket & try & get a kg of home grown beef for $6.  At the moment you might get liver or kidney if you are lucky.  If we are to assume the  ACCC is doing it's job & the over 100% mark up is correct who's paying the overheads in the cattle deal?
