China has weighed into the burgeoning brawl over Darwin Port's lease to a Chinese company, insisting Australians have nothing to fear but has indicated its displeasure with America's plans to rotate long-range bombers through the Top End. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei suggested the debate surrounding the 99-year lease by the Northern Territory Government to the Landbridge Corporation had become irrational."There is no need for the Australian public to have such concerns over the lease of the Darwin port to a Chinese company," Mr Hong told a daily news briefing in China on Wednesday."This investment by a Chinese enterprise is a normal business operation that complies with market principles, international rules and Australian laws."The leasing has brought enormous economic benefits to both countries and is welcomed by the Government and the people of Australia."I am hoping that the public look at the cooperation between Australia and Chinese enterprises more objectively and rationally."The lease debate of Darwin Port – part of which is used as a Defence vessel facility – is occurring in the middle of increasing tensions between China and the US.The ABC reported earlier this week that the US wants to regularly rotate long-range B1 Bombers and aerial tankers through Darwin and Tindal bases, as concerns grow about Beijing's military expansion in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.Military experts have told the ABC having the bombers in the Top End would place them well out of range of Chinese ballistic missiles, but, when deployed with tankers, the B1s could fly deep into Asia's strategic hotspots including the South China Sea.China last night made a veiled criticism of America's plan, saying strategic alliances in the region should benefit all, and not target any third party.Mr Hong's comments follow news the US had conducted polling in Australia – reportedly done by an office within the State Department's intelligence and research bureau – about Darwin Port's lease.The results showed almost half of all respondents were concerned about the deal.The Northern Territory Chief Minister has labelled the debate about the port lease as 'xenophobic'.Speaking to ABC local radio on Thursday, he dismissed potential sensitivities that could develop should the US choose to launch naval or air force operations from Darwin to do with the South China Sea."I welcome it," Mr Giles said."I think that the US have been good strong partners and allies of Australia for many, many a long decade with the ANZUS treaty and so forth."US officials have called on Australia to join its freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea.
