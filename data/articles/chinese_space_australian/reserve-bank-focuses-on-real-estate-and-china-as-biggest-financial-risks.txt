Australia's apartment construction boom and the health of China's economy, inexorably linked, have dominated the Reserve Bank's latest commentary on financial risks. It is not surprising that, with nearly two-thirds of the major banks' loans concentrated in residential real estate, the residential real estate sector is the RBA's primary concern.Worries about housing have been circulating amongst Australia's financial regulators for a while, prompting a belated crackdown on the booming investor lending segment from late-2014 onwards.The tightening of lending standards and cap on investor loan growth by APRA is clearly having an effect, with annualised growth in this segment falling from around 11 per cent to 5 per cent over recent months.That is not surprising, given that the RBA noted that investor loans now attract an average 25-basis-point higher interest rate than owner-occupier loans.However, the success of the crackdown on lending standards is raising the risk of new headaches for property developers and, via them, to the banking system and its regulators."Tighter access to credit for households could pose near-term challenges in some medium and high-density construction markets given the large volume of building activity that was started several years ago," the bank warned in its half-yearly Financial Stability Review."These apartments are popular with investors and foreign buyers and any concerns over settlement risk and/or a slowdown in demand for Australian-located property by Chinese and other Asian residents could lead to difficulties for particular projects, although there is little evidence of either occurring so far." The RBA specifically pointed to inner-city areas of Melbourne, Brisbane and, increasingly, Perth as locations where these risks are greatest.The Reserve Bank extended that warning to also include Sydney when cautioning about potential risks to household finances, because of the large number of apartments due for completion over the next few years."This new supply may weigh on prices and rents in these areas," the RBA warned."If that occurs, investors will need to service their mortgages while earning lower rental income and any households facing difficulties making repayments may not be able to resolve their situation easily by selling the property."Aside from the extra supply, the Reserve Bank also cautioned that the prevalence of Chinese investors could increase the volatility of Australia's property markets, especially Sydney and Melbourne.The RBA said recent Foreign Investment Review Board figures show that overseas buyers could account for as much as a fifth of all recent residential real estate purchases, although it added that the data likely overstate the real figure.As a substantial proportion of the market, the Reserve Bank warned that any severe Chinese economic slowdown could halt the flow of buyers or, worse, trigger a wave of sales as the overseas investors seek to repatriate their savings back home."A substantial reduction in Chinese demand would likely weigh most heavily on the apartment markets of inner-city Melbourne and parts of Sydney, not only because Chinese buyers are particularly prevalent in these segments but also because other factors would reinforce any initial fall in prices," the RBA cautioned."These include the large recent expansion in supply in these areas as well as the practice of buying off-the-plan, which increases the risk of price declines should a large volume of apartments return to the market if the original purchasers fail to settle."A severe Chinese economic slowdown remains a real risk, though not a base case, for the RBA.The Reserve Bank warned that the rapid growth in Chinese debt, especially in the oversupplied residential property sector, funded in large part by the shadow banking system created the real risk of a financial crisis in that country.However, it currently holds to the view that Chinese regulators have the know-how and financial firepower to head-off any crisis.
