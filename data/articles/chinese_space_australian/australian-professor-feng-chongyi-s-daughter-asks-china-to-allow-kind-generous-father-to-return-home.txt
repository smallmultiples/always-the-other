The daughter of a Sydney academic who has been barred from returning to Australia by Chinese authorities has spoken of her family's growing anxiety over his legal situation.Professor Feng Chongyi, a widely respected Chinese academic at the University of Technology in Sydney, has twice been prevented from boarding a flight home in the past week.Speaking to ABC News in her first interview since her father was questioned by Chinese officials, Feng Yunsi has appealed for his speedy return."My dad is honestly one of the sweetest people you will ever meet," she said."He's very kind and generous". Professor Feng had been conducting research in China, but last week at Guangzhou Airport he was intercepted by officials who told him he was not allowed to leave the country."I think he's doing his best to keep in good spirits," Ms Feng, 24, said."Obviously my mum is a bit more anxious, especially as the days go on."And there still doesn't seem to be any sign that he will be released any time soon."Chinese-born Professor Feng is a permanent Australian resident, who has lived and worked in Australia for over 20 years, but was travelling on a Chinese passport, meaning his case is complicated for consular officials.In the past, Professor Feng has criticised Beijing's growing influence in Australia, as well as its crackdown on dissenters in China, prompting fears he is being prevented from leaving for political reasons."My father is a very caring man, he's a very hard worker and all he's ever wanted to do is further people's understandings of China," Ms Feng said.The Australian Government said it has formally raised Professor Feng's case with Beijing and is continuing to provide as much assistance as it can to his family.
