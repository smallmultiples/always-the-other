Former serviceman in the Chinese Army Jiawei Shen has been awarded the 2016 Gallipoli Art Prize for his depiction of Anzac mateship.The Chinese-born Australian artist won the award for his work Yeah, Mate! which he said captured what the Anzac spirit meant to him: mateship, courage and humour - even in the darkest times.The large-scale oil painting is an adaptation of a black and white photograph which hangs in London's Imperial War Museum, and shows an Australian digger carrying an injured soldier over his shoulders at Gallipoli.The photograph by Ernest Brooks has no name but includes the caption, "At Anzac Cove, an Australian bringing in a wounded comrade to hospital. The men were cracking jokes as they made their way down from the front"."This photo is an icon of the First World War, the Anzacs," Shen, who 30 years before was making his money sketching tourists at Circular Quay, told the ABC.The artist said by transforming the photo that way and painting it at a size "larger than life", the viewer could be taken "back to that time" and drawn into that very moment a century ago."In the war itself, the people, the soldiers [can] express their [bravery], their heroism, their comradeship," Shen said."When you see the photo carefully, you can see he is smiling, the soldier ... talking, joking."[But] they're facing the dark days."Shen arrived in Australia in 1989 and has lived among an artist community with his family at Bundeena on the outskirts of southern Sydney for 20 years. An ex-serviceman himself, Shen said he began painting the artwork on the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli landing last year.He donated an earlier version to the local Bundeena RSL.Secondary to his feeling of duty to Australia, he sought out to immortalise the "good qualities" of human beings during war."In the war, the people express many good qualities - at the same time there is evil – [but] this Anzac spirit is a very brave, very good side," Shen said.Having spent years in the Chinese military as a soldier and artist, Shen said he was "deeply moved" when attending remembrance ceremonies in Australia in the early years after his arrival in Sydney."Australian people have a very unique way to celebrate their servicemen," Shen said.Shen collected $20,000 in prize winnings, a long way from his earlier $20 fee for sketching tourists.Now a multi-award-winning artist – with subjects like Pope John Francis and Crown Princess Mary of Denmark in his repertoire - he dedicates some of his success as a portrait artist to this early sketching practice.It is a practice he remains connected to by sketching people free of charge at the National Portrait Gallery and his local art community.The exhibition will be open to the public at the Gallipoli Memorial Club in Circular Quay from April 21 to April 29.
