When China steps on to the pitch for their next AFC Asian Cup group match in Brisbane on Wednesday night, there could be a lot riding on the result for Australia too.If the Asian giant wins, more Chinese fans are tipped to head down under for the quarter finals, potentially spending up big on a holiday afterwards.After China's 1-0 win over Saudi Arabia last Saturday, fickle fans back home were suddenly much more interested in their team."A lot of people are not so interested that much because [China's team] haven't been providing results," said James Kwok, the chief coordinator for the Welcoming Committee for the Chinese National Football Team."But beating Saudi Arabia, it's a big result, it's a very big result."I think, say if Australia beat say Holland or even Germany - it's that big."China Travel Service is a wholesaler for Asian Cup tickets and also books Australian package holidays for Chinese tourists.General manager Jonathan Sun said the day after China's first match win in the Asian Cup, inquiries flooded in."It's a very good start for the Chinese team and after the first game we found more interest from China," Mr Sun said.Its next group match is against Uzbekistan but most fans are expected if China makes the quarter finals."Most of the fans, they make a last-minute decision, it pretty much depends on the performance of the national team," Mr Sun said.Mr Sun said his team of travel agents is preparing to sell a lot of game tickets and holiday packages to inbound tourists if China makes the quarter finals."This is a long-haul travel to Australia, so not only they just watching the game, they also wish to visit Australia to travel in Australia."He expects Chinese tourists to spend at least $1,000 each on top of flights, accommodation and food.Many Australian industries will be hoping for a good result too, with Chinese business leaders among those here to watch the games.Asian Cup 2015 CEO Michael Brown said having the "World Cup of Asia" in Australia provides some enormous opportunities for deals to be done."I've been into so many of our hospitality lounges and seen and met the large number of Chinese dignitaries, VIPs and senior business people, associated bankers, financial institutions and major businesses," Mr Brown said."[They have] all been invited by relevant [Australian] Government authorities to make sure that we are connecting and that we are using their favourite sport as a way to grow business."China is Australia's biggest trading partner but two of our other top trading partners also have teams competing.PriceWaterhouseCoopers estimates the Asian Cup overall will kick $23 million into Australia's economy. "I would be really confident we'll go well beyond," Mr Brown said."So the total package for the Asian Cup is quite compelling in what it's done for tourism, trade, investment and engaging in multicultural communities."Tourism Australia managing director John O'Sullivan said Australia's hosting of the Asian Cup provides a fantastic opportunity to show the world that Australia is "a top-class welcoming host for major events and also as a highly desirable destination"."This 23-day festival of football provides the perfect platform for Australia to showcase our credentials as a great place to visit amongst some of our most important overseas markets," Mr O'Sullivan said."With more than 500,000 spectators - including around 30,000 fans from overseas - expected to attend the 32 matches being played across Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Canberra and Newcastle, this is a tourism free kick."The television coverage of many of the games has shown a lot of empty seats at the group games that have been played so far, but Mr Brown is not concerned."For some of the smaller communities we're not going to sell those out we understand that," he said."We've set a target of 8,000 to 10,000 for the smallest games and we've achieved that."[Ticket sales at] some of the bigger games have been well ahead of expectations."The television audience will be the largest, with an estimated two and a half billion people across Asia expected to watch the coverage.
