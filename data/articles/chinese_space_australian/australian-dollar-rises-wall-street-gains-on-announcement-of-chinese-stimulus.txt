Optimism about China drove the Australian dollar back above 70 US cents overnight, and also contributed to strong gains on Wall Street.Global investors were encouraged by gains for the Shanghai composite index yesterday, and an announcement of further Chinese stimulus to encourage longer-term investment in stocks rather than the erratic buying and selling of recent months.The Australian dollar was trading back at 70.2 US cents at 7:30am, a full cent up on a day earlier.In New York the S&P 500 added 48 points or 2.5 per cent to 1,969.Bluechip stocks fared similarly, with the Dow Jones rising 2.4 per cent (390 points) to 16,493.US traders had ground to make up, after Wall Street's closure for the prior day's Labor Day holiday.Despite the focus on China, they were willing to look past some weak trade data released yesterday.The value of Chinese exports fell by 6 per cent in August, compared to a year earlier, while imports were down nearly 14 per cent.Investors were similarly unfazed by a warning from World Bank chief economist Kaushik Basu against raising US interest rates this month."The world economy is looking so troubled that if the US goes in for a very quick move in the middle of this I feel it is going to affect countries quite badly," he told the Financial Times newspaper.European markets added to their gains of the previous session.The Euro Stoxx index closed 1.1 per cent (36 points) higher at 3,234 and the FTSE 100 in London rose 1.2 per cent (72 points) to 6,146.Germany's DAX added 1.6 per cent (163 points) to 10,271.Futures trade points to a positive start for the local share market this morning; the ASX SPI 200 was 42 points or 0.8 per cent higher at 5,142 at 7:30am.West Texas crude oil slipped a little overnight to $US45.87 a barrel.But spot gold was a little higher at $US1,121 an ounce, as was iron ore at $US56.40 a tonne.Against the other main currencies, the Australian dollar was buying around 62.6 euro cents, 45.6 British pence and 84.1 Japanese yen.
