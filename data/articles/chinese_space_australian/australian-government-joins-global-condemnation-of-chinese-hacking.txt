Australian officials have confirmed local companies are among the global victims of an extensive campaign of cyber attacks backed by the Chinese Government, aimed at stealing commercial intellectual property. Senior intelligence sources have told the ABC it is the biggest threat to Australia's cyber security uncovered so far.The confirmation came after the US Justice Department charged two Chinese citizens, alleging they carried out hacking at the direction of Beijing's Ministry of State Security.It is the first time Australia has named China as responsible for such behaviour, marking a change in rhetoric and diplomatic pressure from Canberra.National Cyber Security adviser Alastair MacGibbon said the group had been targeting IT companies around the world that provide services to medium and large businesses."This is audacious, it is huge, and it impacts potentially thousands of businesses globally. We know there are victims in Australia," Mr MacGibbon told RN Breakfast.He would not detail which Australian businesses had fallen victim to the hacking, but argued the intellectual property theft disadvantaged local companies and their staff."And that essentially takes food from the people of Australia," Mr MacGibbon said."It helps them compete in a way that we can't." Australia's Ambassador for Cyber Affairs Tobias Feakin argued Australia was taking a big step in naming and shaming China for its support of hacking."This is incredibly significant, we've never done this before. This is the first time we've ever actually named this particular country in relation to this issue," Dr Feakin told AM."The language that we're using, we feel, represents how strongly we feel about this, which is incredibly strong. "As an international community, as Australia, we are now far more robust in the way that we will name and shame, and we will shine a light on activities that we think are unacceptable."Foreign Minister Marise Payne and Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton issued a statement shortly after US officials announced the charges, voicing Australia's "serious concern" about the hacking allegations."When it is in our interests to do so, Australia publicly attributes cyber incidents, especially those with the potential to undermine global economic growth, national security and international stability," the pair said in a statement."Australia calls on all countries — including China — to uphold commitments to refrain from cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, trade secrets and confidential business information with the intent of obtaining a competitive advantage. "These commitments were agreed by G20 leaders in 2015. Australia and China reaffirmed them bilaterally in 2017."China's Foreign Ministry said on Friday it resolutely opposed "slanderous" accusations from the US and other allies criticising China for economic espionage, and urged Washington to withdraw its accusations.The US should also withdraw charges against two Chinese citizens, the ministry said, adding that China had never participated in or supported any stealing of commercial secrets and had lodged "stern representations" with Washington."We urge the US side to immediately correct its erroneous actions and cease its slanderous smears relating to internet security," it said, adding it would take necessary measures to safeguard its own cybersecurity and interests.It has long been an "open secret" that US government agencies have hacked into and listened in on foreign governments, companies and individuals, the ministry added."The US side making unwarranted criticisms of China in the name of so-called 'cyber stealing' is blaming others while oneself is to be blamed, and is self-deception. China absolutely cannot accept this."
