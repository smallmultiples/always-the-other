Justice Minister Michael Keenan is trying to dispel backbench angst about the Australia-China extradition treaty, as the Government fights a rear-guard action to stop Parliament from blocking the contentious agreement.Mr Keenan and Attorney-General George Brandis briefed about 10 Coalition MPs about the treaty on Monday afternoon.Some of those MPs are deeply uneasy about the Government's decision to push ahead with ratification of the agreement, which has been stuck in limbo for a decade after being signed by the Howard government.They point to China's poor human rights record, and are sceptical about the Government's assurances that safeguards within the agreement will offer sufficient protection to Australians deported there.Legal groups have also been fiercely critical of the agreement, saying Australians should not be deported to China while its judicial system is plagued with human rights abuses.The Coalition is already facing a difficult battle to stop the Senate from blocking the treaty from being ratified.Newly independent Senator Cory Bernardi has flagged he will move a motion to stop ratification, arguing it would be impossible for Australians extradited to China to secure a fair trial.The Greens and several crossbench Senators have backed the push to block it, which means its fate rests with Labor.The Opposition flagged concerns about ratification in a parliamentary report released last year, calling for a review of the Extradition Act to ensure it is consistent with international legal obligations.The shadow cabinet is discussing its position on Monday night, and Labor will make a final decision at its caucus meeting on Tuesday morning.Several Labor sources have predicted that the ALP will decide to vote for Senator Bernardi's motion and sink the agreement. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said Labor was still weighing up its position."We're currently considering this matter very carefully. It is a matter of great importance," he said."It goes to questions of our relationship with China [but] it goes though, of course, to human rights, and it goes to questions of law. Our party will be discussing this matter in the coming days before the vote."The Government briefed Labor on the changes on Monday â€” and argued blocking ratification could offend China and do enormous damage to the bilateral relationship.Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull warned killing off the treaty could undermine cooperation between Australian and Chinese law enforcement agencies."The treaty ... needs to be ratified. We are urging the opposition and the crossbenchers to support the ratification," Mr Turnbull said."There are very considerable protections in the treaty, and it is an important part of our cooperation with China on law enforcement."
