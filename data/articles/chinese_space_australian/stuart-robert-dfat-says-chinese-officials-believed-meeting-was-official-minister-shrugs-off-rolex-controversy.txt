The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) says Chinese officials believed they were meeting Human Services Minister Stuart Robert in an official capacity when he travelled to Beijing last year.Mr Robert is under investigation for a trip to China in 2014, where he appeared at a signing ceremony for a mining deal between Australian company Nimrod Resources and a Chinese business.He also met Chinese government officials during the visit.Labor Senator Penny Wong today pressed the DFAT head Peter Varghese about the trip during Senate estimates.Senator Wong asked whether it was appropriate that a minister "rock up to one of these meetings" without informing the department first. "Would you ever advise a foreign minister to hold such a meeting?" she said.Mr Varghese said that were questions of judgement for the minister.Senator Wong also pressed the matter with Graham Fletcher, First Assistant Secretary of the North Asia Division."It's plain that the company and the Chinese Government thought they were dealing with Mr Robert in his ministerial capacity?" she said.Mr Fletcher responded "yes".The exchange followed news Mr Robert held a function with a Chinese billionaire, who later gave out Rolex watches as gifts.Mr Robert has now confirmed that in 2013, Chinese businessman Li Ruipeng presented himself and other Coalition figures with Rolexes during a dinner attended by former prime minister Tony Abbott and Liberal Party donor Paul Marks.Mr Robert said the dinner in his Parliament House office was not held at the request of Mr Marks, who last year donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Liberal Party.He told the ABC that he hosted the dinner, which he described as "no different to a boardroom meeting"."[It's] no different to private dinners that are hosted by other MPs almost every night here," he said.It has been revealed Mr Ruipeng provided watches said to be worth approximately $250,000 in total to MPs at the 2013 dinner.Mr Robert said the watches had since been returned."We thought they were fake, until Ian Macfarlane got a heads up that perhaps they weren't," he said."Having said that, I declared them, because I declare everything in terms of gifts."We got them valued and sought advice from the Clerk and then they were returned."A photo published in News Corp's Herald Sun shows Mr Robert posing with Mr Ruipeng, raising a glass alongside Mr Abbott and LNP MP Ian Macfarlane.It is unclear who leaked the photo.Mr Robert refused to comment on an internal investigation over a trip to China, which Labor claimed was a breach of ministerial standards.The Opposition yesterday tried to censure Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull over his response to Mr Robert's actions, saying he had failed to enforce his own ministerial standards.Opposition Leader Bill Shorten and Shadow Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus each tried to move a motion, though both failed due to the Government's numbers in the Lower House.
