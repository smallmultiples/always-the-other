Trade Minister Andrew Robb has defended the Government's free trade agreement (FTA) with China, dismissing concerns of the deal opening up Australia further to its largest trading partner.Australia signed the FTA with China yesterday after nearly 10 years of negotiation, with Mr Robb saying the deal was the most significant China had ever signed with a developed country.The Government said 14 commercial agreements were signed, covering projects potentially worth more than $20 billion.Among the big winners will be the mining sector, dairy farmers and wine exporters.The FTA also eliminates all of China's tariffs on Australian resources and energy products.Mr Robb said "throughout history people have always had reservations about any new wave of investment". "People will start to see the benefits, the jobs that come out of it and the opportunities, and not have the fear that often is pushed around the country," he told the ABC's 7.30 program.The Opposition's Penny Wong said Labor would determine whether the deal was in the national interest once it had seen the details. "The Government has refused to release the text to you, me and every other Australian to tell us the detail of what they've actually agreed, and in fact the text won't be released until after signing next year," she said."But overall, what we say is, the principle of trade liberalisation is good for the economy, good for Australian jobs." Radio shock jock Alan Jones yesterday criticised the deal during an interview with Prime Minister Tony Abbott, saying the FTA failed to "pass the pub test"."To win an election, you've got to pass the pub test. But can Tony Abbott go and buy a farm in China?," Jones said."No. The answer's no, Prime Minister. The answer is no, he can't."Under the FTA, China can bring skilled labourers to Australia to work on major projects, but Mr Robb said this would not be at the cost of jobs for local labourers.We hope it's as good as is foretold... we wait for serious economists and analysts to look into that mix of details to see what will be revealed. "It means that if there are no Australian labourers available - and it won't be labourers, it will be skilled workers - for a particular project, they will be able to apply to get an investment facilitation agreement," he said."And this is consistent with legislation that is already in place, there's nothing new in this."Concerns were also raised the deal could increase the country's economic dependency on China.Dr Geremie Barme, Chinese history professor at Australian National University, said the implications of the deal for Australia would only be known in the "weeks and months ahead"."So one should be very cautious about this," Dr Barme told the ABC's Lateline program."We hope it's as good as is foretold... we wait for serious economists and analysts to look into that mix of details to see what will be revealed."Mr Robb said this would be a problem if Australia was only looking to enhance trade with China, and not other countries also. "This is part of the trifecta, we've got the Japanese [FTA] concluded in May and we've got the Korean one concluded before that," he said. "The three countries themselves, in north Asia, represent 52 per cent of our current exports, so we have got a big spread."Mr Robb said Australia was also looking at FTAs with India, Indonesia, and the Gulf states."So there is a lot of other activity happening and I think you will find that we will be providing [for] as we do now, so many parts of the world for decades and decades to come."The FTA deal will mean tariffs on Australian resources, dairy products, beef and live animal exports to China will be scrapped.However, Australia has failed to gain a deal for cotton, wheat, sugar, rice and oilseed farmers after the two sides could not agree on China's demand for greater access for its state-owned enterprises. The 3 per cent coking coal tariff is expected to be removed immediately and the 6 per cent tariff on thermal coal should be phased out within two years.In the services sector banks, insurers, lawyers and universities will find it much easier to operate in China with Australian companies able to open hotels, restaurants and nursing homes.The Australian dairy sector is expected to get an equal, if not better, deal than New Zealand, with tariffs to be phased out by 2025.Mr Abbott said the agreement is a great deal for China and Australia."In particular it's a very good day for Australia," he said."And this agreement is the first that China has concluded with a substantial economy, with a major economy and it's the most comprehensive agreement that China has concluded with anyone."Chinese president Xi Jinping also welcomed the long-awaited deal."As the Chinese saying goes it takes 10 years to sharpen a sword, so we are very glad to see that after nearly 10 years of negotiation our two sides have announced this substantive conclusion to the bilateral FTA negotiation," he said."This will provide a bigger market, more favourable conditions and better institutional support for our cooperation."
