As Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran prepare to face the firing squad this week, an analysis of Indonesian sentencing reveals foreigners cop the heaviest penalties for drug offences while some locals are shown leniency, writes Hamish McDonald.It will be scant help to the two Australians and six other foreigners now facing imminent execution on Nusakambangan Island, but the case of fellow convict Serge Atlaoui, now subject to temporary reprieve, shows the inconsistencies and favouritism of the judicial system that sentenced them.Atlaoui, a 51-year-old French citizen, is the first to face the firing squad out of 17 people arrested in November 2005 in a police raid at Tangerang, close to Jakarta, on what was described as the largest methamphetamine and ecstasy pill factory to be busted in South-East Asia.The Indonesian police said they had seized 62.4 tonnes of chemicals used for crystal methamphetamine and 6.6 tonnes of chemicals used to make ecstasy, as well as thousands of ecstasy pills and hundreds of kilograms of methamphetamine about to be transported to Hong Kong. Some of the precursor chemicals had arrived in shipments labelled as soy-beans.Indonesian media reports said the raid followed months of surveillance by Indonesian, Australian, US and Chinese police.Among the 17 arrested were the two Indonesian businessmen described as the ringleaders of the drug operation: factory owner Benny Sudrajat (also known as Benny Oei) and his deputy, Budi Sucipto (alias Iming Santoso).However a Chinese businessman known as Peter Wong, who seems to have helped with finance, sourcing of raw materials and assembly of technical expertise, escaped arrest, and is still wanted by Indonesian police.Four other Indonesians went on to be charged in the case: a storekeeper named Samad Sani, a chemist named Hendra Rahardja, Sudrajat's son Kevin Saputra, and a maintenance man named Toto Kusriadi. Four others, an electrician and three security guards, were released without charge.The Frenchman, a welder by trade, was one of two Westerners - the other being a Dutchman named Nicolaas Garnick Gerardus, who is alleged to have been a chemist. A third Westerner, a Dutchman known as "Max", appears to have escaped arrest.Five Chinese citizens comprised a third group, said to be specialised in the production of methamphetamine, known in Indonesia by its Japanese-origin name, shabu-shabu.Curiously, the three groups were given separate trials.The two alleged masterminds, Sudrajat and Sucipto, were found guilty and sentenced to death, a penalty upheld at two levels of appeal. Both filed last year for a peninjauan kembali (PK, a trial review) which is still in the course of hearing by the original court.Three other Indonesians (Sani, Rahardja, and Saputra) received jail sentences of 15 years, raised to 20 years on appeal. The fourth, Kusriadi, got 10 years.The five Chinese each received 20-year jail terms, which were affirmed at the first appeal, then raised to the death sentence at the final appeal. One of them died in detention, and the other four have had PK applications before the Supreme Court apparently since early last year, without a decision.The two Westerners received life sentences at their trial, which were upheld at the first appeal, and then elevated to the death sentence at the final appeal to the Supreme Court. The Dutchman, Gerardus, has died while in jail, and the Frenchman, Atlaoui, still has a PK under way.The ultimate sentencing seems to show a tendency for the foreigners to cop the heaviest penalties. All the foreigners ended up with the death penalty, while some of the Indonesians were shown relative leniency.And as Diane Zhang has previously shown, in 2015 there are more foreigners slated for execution than the total number of foreigners killed in the previous 16 years.Notably, would Altaoui, a welder helping put the factory together, have been more implicated in the grand scheme of drug manufacture than the boss's son, Kevin Saputra, or the chemist Hendra Rahardja?Justice has shown itself less than impartial in the handling of the PK processes. The ringleader, Sudrajat, has been allowed to call witnesses and experts other than those called to previous hearings of the case. Atlaoui has not.The Frenchman, who has been held in a prison remote from Jakarta, has had to pay the costs of getting himself and a heavy police escort to the capital for hearings of his case review. The attitude of the prosecutor at the review has been that it is a mere formality, and at the start one of his officials asked Atlaoui for his body measurements to prepare for the execution.The Dutch chemist, now dead, tried to clear Atlaoui by saying his work was simply to set up machines, and that he had not helped any production tests. Although supported by police evidence, the Frenchman never had this point accepted by the courts, and the final appeal judgement called him a chemist. Atlaoui has insisted all along that he thought he was helping build an acrylics factory.Up until a day or two ago, the Indonesian authorities were pressing to have Atlaoui face the firing squads alongside Andrew Chan, Myuran Sukumaran and others in their execution batch.This was despite the fact that six other death row convicts in the Tangerang drug factory case, including the alleged principals, still have ongoing case reviews that might cast a different light on Atlaoui's level of involvement - and the professed Indonesian policy that convicts in the same case like Chan and Sukumaran should be executed at the same time.The suspicion must be strong that the foreigner was to be the scapegoat while the influence of the businessman Sudrajat was at work in the Supreme Court to eventually reduce or indefinitely delay his sentence.In the event, the strong statement of the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, pointing out the vagaries of a "dysfunctional" Indonesian judicial system, has pulled Atlaoui out of the execution list, at least for now.That Chan and Sukumaran are guilty of trying to smuggle commercial quantities of heroin is beyond doubt, and not contested.That their appeals and reviews have been heard by such a flawed system, and that then, after 10 years of successful rehabilitation, their sentences were ticked off by a new president intent on showing himself tough on drugs, will not reflect well on Indonesia if the executions are carried out, on them or the others scheduled for the firing squad.After all, doesn't the second principle of Indonesia's five-point state ideology, the Pancasila, read: Kemanusiaan Yang Adil dan Beradab - a just and civilized humanity?It would seem, when appropriate, Indonesia can be as inconsistent with ideology as it is with justice.This article was originally written for New Mandala, a specialist website on Southeast Asia culture, society and politics.

This should not surprise in a country where it is almost a national sport to blame foreigners for conspiracies to hold Indonesia back. I think  Indonesians relish finding ways to cause us discomfort. Pew research has found that Muslim countries tend to blame their various woes on the West more than their own governments. Don't forget their laughably lenient sentences given to terrorists. When the dreadful event occurs we should react strongly including some breaking of diplomatic ties and Australians should boycott Indonesian products.

27 Apr 2015 4:45:35pmWhether minimum sentences represent 'base political purposes' or not is a matter for debate.What isn't a matter for debate is that judicial sentencing is meant to reflect community values in accordance with the principle of proportionality.If judges are consistently handing down sentences that are too lenient then that reflection is absent.

27 Apr 2015 10:26:57pmI lived in Indonesia for over 4 years and can attest personally to the corruption that pervades that society at every level, not just within the judiciary. Anybody visiting that country should understand this fact of life, as they may run into corrupt practices from the moment they arrive in the country. This however does not change the fact that all visitors to Indonesia are aware of the dangers of being involved with drugs. It is in your face from the moment you step off the plane. As for the writers indignation at the inconsistency in sentencing.... really!! You only have to look at the way the people in Australia are treated differently by the courts depending upon their status. We should not be shouting too loudly about this issue as it is just as prevalent within the Australian judicial system. Thankfully, we do not have the death penalty.

28 Apr 2015 1:04:48pmFran, I did not read Andrew's comment as insinuating Australia's judiciary was corrupt.However there is ample evidence in Australia, the USA and a number of Western countries, that the rich overall get lighter sentences than do the poor for equivalent crimes, and are statistically much more likely to get off scott free. Further, there are also elements of racial bias, this is particularly the case in the USA, but also here. And its not just the judiciary. Having an aboriginal name vs. a white name on an identical resume yields VERY different results for job applicants.

28 Apr 2015 4:16:56amI know from personal experience, as a law abiding citizen,  that at least one state government does tell judges exactly what decisions to make in order to prevent criminal charges against government administrations. Hello South Australia. In fact that State, when faced with an unpublished crisis, suppressed even by the media, created legislation in 2012 that enables creation of a private kangaroo court, that excludes public and media, to facilitate the exemption government criminal administration from punishment. I couldn't believe it, I always thought the same way everyone else does. That's probably because we can't envisage a situation so dire as to necessitate corruption of the legal system. Well I've experienced the unenvisageable.

You also talk of a judiciary independent of Government yet as is pointed out here govt  interferes in sentencing here we have politicians interfering in matters that are sub-judice the most recent "terror" arrests being a case in point.The system in Indonesia as you rightly point out is corrupt but that also applies across the board from private enterprise to the top of the tree.

Indonesia is not a friend to Australia.  It threatens us with releasing boat migrants which its officials profiteer from, it does not consider killing Australians as worthy of the death penalty as moving drugs (both are worthy to me), it threatens its neighboring countries which appear far more willing to cooperate with Australia, it has a questionable democratic system at best, permits fishermen to overfish in Australian waters in such quantities that many fish are overfished before Australia even begins and more.  There are many countries in the world that are not worth Australia's time.  Its time we left Indonesia on its own.  They have been unwilling to help us in any area, yet very willing to receive help.

I don't know how many times we need it thrown in our faces that Indonesia is overtly hostile towards Australia, is racist towards Australians & those from other secular wealthy Western nations, & that it intends us no good whatsoever.  The whole people smuggling fiasco of the continuous flotillas of boats launched from Indonesia, openly with help from Indonesian officials, in the most utter contempt for Australia, should have woken us up to Indonesia's attitude towards us.  We should remove all aid, look after our own country first, & remove all ties with Indonesia.  Why Australians continue to holiday in such a corrupt, racist & insidiously hostile country, is a mystery.  There are far better, more friendly places to go, that aren't simmering under the surface with hatred & ill intent towards Australians.

27 Apr 2015 4:57:33pmWether you agree with the death penalty via the state or not one thing that would add more international pressure to this particular state is the manner of execution. Death by firing squad is inhumane and sometimes inaccurate.Even in the US a still existing death penalty country doing so humanely is a top priority. Even there however they struggle to find death via the needle drugs as world supply is in extremely short demand due to minimal manufacture and is very hard to come by.   The international community could apply immense pressure via the manner of execution alone. And I doubt Indonesia could find the drug supply required that even the US finds hard to source. Just a thought for their legal team.  The 'method' of execution is unreliable, inaccurate, and inhumane. 
Alert moderator
27 Apr 2015 7:53:47pmYou are wrong pink... the drugs various US states use are only in short supply because the EU (where the drugs are made) refuses to sell them to the USA because European governments see the lethal injection method as cruel. Numerous such executions have gone wrong resulting in prolonged agonising deaths. So states like Arkansas are planning to bring back the firing squad. They aren't so different really.
Alert moderator
28 Apr 2015 11:38:05amHI Tim,I don't see how what I said is much different from what you said.So how am i wrong?I am aware of the reasons for short supply in the US which is halting and stalling the execution machine over there. It boils down to inhumane deaths.Therefore the argument stands. One US state 'planning' to bring back the firing squad to get around not having access to minimally manufactured drugs (world wide) adds little weight to a counter argument. Lets see how successful 'Arkansas' is in acheiving this 'plan' though.

The Australian government needs to be much more careful about the safety of its citizens going to Indonesia in this climate of anti foreign feeling.

Religion is one of if not the biggest cause of conflict and political unrest in the world, and imposing ones beliefs on others is wrong. In Australia, religion and state are separate for good reason. Keep religion out of the equation, it has zero relevance and a negative net gain at best. You are in effect supporting killing people indirectly with drugs in Australia is okay, but not supporting killing the people trying to do this is not? So killing is okay as long as it fits in with some religious interpretation? Like I said, religion is best left out of the argument.

He looks no better than a crime boss sending a hit squad out to kill people to send a message to his subjects.If an individual cannot commit a legal murder then The State (a bunch of individuals) should have no more right to do so, regardless of the crime. In this case however, it's the Indonesian President who's about to commit murder, if the executions go ahead.

Alert moderator
27 Apr 2015 4:02:31pmThe general assumption with penalties is that the higher the penalty, the greater the deterrent effect it will have. This assumes that people perform some form of trade study prior to committing the crime in order to weigh up the pros of potential success with the cons of the penalties or in other word it assumes that everybody makes rational decisions. This isn't the case. People sometimes make spur of the moment decisions based upon either strong emotion or a desperate need. In such moments the full consequences of their actions do not occur to them or are quickly written off as not being likely to occur. Given this aspect of human nature, it is only a matter of time before others find themselves before an Indonesian court.

27 Apr 2015 4:23:20pm@lillyI never dismissed the fact that any form of punishment will be an absolute deterrent. There are always going to be people behaving in ways that defy reason.

27 Apr 2015 4:25:47pmA spur of the moment decision is whether to stop at the amber light or put your foot down.To conspire with a group of like-minded individuals to go and perform an illegal activity in another country, then to get on a plane and execute (no pun intended) that plan in a jurisdiction where everyone would be / should be aware that the death penalty is applicable is anything but 'spur of the moment'.This is not a 'momentary' crime, like being provoked into punching someone in the nose. It's a calculated gamble with known outcomes - one being a lot of cash and the other being the death penalty.

Alert moderator
28 Apr 2015 8:53:32amI suppose it all depends on what you regard as a deterrant.   In the world of organised crime it could be argued that the "death penalty" is a fact of life in that you're probably more likely to be knocked off by one of your own than by the State.  So in this situation one could argue that death is simply one of the risk/reward scenarios of the business.I think deterrants are aimed at what one could call the opportunistic criminal or "honest" thief.   As an example, we lock our doors and keep valuables hidden away to stop crimes by passers by who might see a quick benefit to them.  These measures seldom stop the determined criminal who plans and sees what they do as an occupation.I've often wondered how "honest" the average person is.  Do we abide by the "rules" because it's the right thing to do? Or are we driven by the fear of getting caught?   I don't think the answers to these questions are as easy as might appear.   When deterrence is raised in relation to criminal matters I really do start to think we are driven more by fear than by what is "right".
Alert moderator
28 Apr 2015 11:29:31amThanks, Edward. I find that the word 'deterrent' is mis-read in many arguments on the drum. There are those that say the existence of crime means that what we call a deterrent is not a deterrent. I would argue that a deterrent is something that deters just one person, rather than having to deter everyone. Having deterrents makes crime more difficult and aims to prevent the casual or opportunistic criminal descending into consistent antisocial and lawless behaviours, as you say. What is 'right' is not so 'black and white' as we imagine and is prone to disagreement. I would hope that the law is slightly more 'black and white' (whilst we can admit it isn't absolutely clear 100% of the time), or that it should at least treat everyone equally without fear or favour.I know it might be unpopular to say, but fear is a tremendous motivating force. When people are in fear of consequences, they frequently further their anti-social or law-breaking behaviours by making further attempts to cover up a crime. In my view, such covering up should further implicate a criminal and should incur harsher penalties because the criminal has, in each stage of their actions, refused to comply with socially expected behaviours. For example, a 'hit and run' criminal should be always given the absolute maximum penalty because their actions betray a callous disregard for other people. While it wouldn't be a deterrent that deters everyone in every instance, if we can encourage more people to stop and assist, we might save a few innocent lives in the process.

28 Apr 2015 2:00:30pmInteresting points Applaudanum.Your last paragraph actually clarified something for me in relation to the article.   The concept of rating up a penalty from a long prison sentence to death seems to equate with the idea that the act of appealing is in a way trying to continue to deny the crime and persist with a cover up.I think one of the main problems with coming down hard on certain scenarios is that everyone reacts differently to different situations.  The fight or flight response is very powerful and takes a great deal to overcome.   So, what someone might do in a crisis may be very different to how they would react later on after rational thought has returned.  With this in mind I suppose I'm a little more forgiving to some sorts of crimes and the immediate aftermath.  It really comes down to what happens in the days following.  With the hit and run scenario, for example, I think someone who turns themselves in should be given some credit for that.

28 Apr 2015 2:41:16pmThanks, Edward.Yes, there's appealing the verdict and appealing the sentence. There are also various 'grounds' for appeal, such as a media-led jury. In this respect, I'm probably a little more sympathetic to appeals on 'procedural' grounds and would hope that the defendant doesn't risk adding to their penalty in such instances. I would hope that the law could differentiate between someone having a valid complaint and someone just 'trying it on'. 'Some' credit, perhaps. But that line of credit should get very thin if an autopsy reveals that the victim may have survived if an ambulance was called sooner, or if CCTV footage shows the driver, just 10 minutes before the incident, exiting a drinking establishment in a staggering manner before getting in their car, before bumping a few parked cars and  driving off.

27 Apr 2015 2:28:24pmThe executions of the two Australians are all but inevitable.  There has been very strong anti foreign rhetoric by Jokowi at the recent Asia Africa forum demonstrating the old tactic of blaming the west for the poverty of the developing nations.  The emphasis on executing foreigners needs to be seen as part of this discourse.  The message is very clear:  Indonesia's drug problem is caused by foreigners. Australia needs to fully front this anti foreign rhetoric in its response to the executions.  We need to show very clearly that Australians are not to blame for their drug problem. One way to do this is to ban departure by Australians holding tickets indicating Indonesia as a destination.  If hardly any Australians go to Indonesia and the drug problem inevitably continues we will have proved the point. We also need to make clear to Indonesia the value in a relationship with Australia by demonstrating what the lack of such a relationship entails.
Alert moderator
27 Apr 2015 3:24:33pmThe downside to your arguement is that, in all likelyhood, given the nature of Aussies who visit Indonesia, the drug issue will drop rapidly for them, proving Indonesia's point that Australian Tourists are to blame... and they'd be right. When last I visited Bali, the only people offering me drugs were expat Aussies and Aussie tourists... and I casually pointed them out to the local police. I'd say more than half the yobbos and bogans who visit Bali are directly responsible for Indonesia's drug trade.

All the foreigners ended up with the death penalty, while some of the Indonesians were shown relative leniency."This is hardly a surprise. The Indonesians are being tough, they're being seen to be tough and they're making no apologies. It's exactly as per the current Australian government and boatpeople/people smugglers, whose aggression towards foreigners who break "our" rules is broadcast throughout the region.And tell you what, it's presumably having some effect on the drug-smugglers' "business model" too.I'm perfectly happy to live in a country with no death penalty but Australia can't claim a lot of moral high ground when it comes to criminal punishment of Australians doing the wrong things overseas.

27 Apr 2015 5:27:39pmWell said Audax. There's also the old biblical saying "he who is without sin cast the first stone". Personally I don't like the commentary on here baying for blood. The blood of the 2 Australians facing execution (and the lifetime of pain for their families) or baying for Indonesian 'blood' either through bans or whatever. It's a sad situation and I feel for all involved.On top of that, to be honest the war on drugs has been waging for decades with all kinds of punitive actions but it hasn't stopped it one single bit. It's as big now as it ever was. It's an abject failure. As for the war on drugs itself look at Mexico where it really is a war with over 10,000 murders a year and then look at Portugal and see how many deaths are happening in each scenario...you might find your answer to all this.

They haven't won the war and probably never will but drug overdoses, drug related crime and sexually transmitted diseases (HIV etc.) also associated with drug use have all dramtically decreased. They also have the world's highest success rates in rehabilitation.Indonesia, Australia, USA, other Asian countries because I know Indonesia isn't the only one etc. etc.  are really showing how pig headed and stupid we all are for continuing policies that haven't worked for hundreds of years.

28 Apr 2015 9:02:01amCorrect aeuc. Interestingly the drug sniffer dogs police use at dance parties etc have proven to escalate risky drug taking behaviour where people pre-load as much as possible before going to the party therefore increasing the risk of overdose. Also, many overdoses relate to what other chemicals have been added to the pill etc other than the active ingredient that's being taken. Recent trials of the use of technology that can detect harmful additional chemicals in recreational drugs have shown that when the person has been advised that the pill etc has 'other' harmful chemicals in it other than the desired active ingredient they have refused to take the pill...without the availability of that technology people will take that pill and take the risk of overdose purely because they do not know what's in it. Our methods, and other countries as you point out, of dealing with the drug issue actually increases the drug problem not reduce it. Trouble is ignorant people want to see something being done in a punitive way, they just can't get their head around the fact that there is a much better way to deal with all this. And this includes the AFP's shameful way of handling these men in the first place and have them arrested in a country where the death penalty exists...to me they have blood on their hands and I'd love to see them face the families and tell them they did the right thing.

First, removing any aid & trade to Indonesia, & stopping Indonesia from purchasing Australian property in order to escape oversight of their monstrously cruel & barbaric treatment towards cattle.  Second, & just as importantly; whoever in the AFP is responsible for putting the Bali nine into the hands of Indonesian corrupt judicial system, should be hauled before a commission, & should lose their job.  They could easily have arrested this lot the moment they landed in Australian territory, with all the proof required to prosecute.

28 Apr 2015 2:31:59pmAlthough guidelines and not law, the AFP is not supposed to share information with countries where that information might lead to the death penalty. It should be law and, personally, I think all AFP staff involved should be charged with conspiracy (with Indonesian authorities) to commit manslaughter.Sure, lock up the Bali nine (all of them) and throw away the key if you like but these two were reducing Indonesia's drug problem and increasing ours by taking heroin OUT of Indonesia and INTO Australia. They should be punished here for importing rather than there for exporting.At the same time, drug addiction itself should be treated as a medical condition not a criminal one. Until we get that through our thick heads the drug problem will just keep getting bigger.

Let's not forget that it was foreign 'Crusader' kings/captains/troops who were held for ransom by the forces of Islam during the time of the Crusades.It was so common that it became the "done thing" to have hostages to barter for bucks... In fact, troops (I believe on both sides!) would even target those individuals who identified themselves as worthy of capture, by waving banners or wearing better armour etc. in the hope of making themselves rich once they got hold of the ransom.Maybe Indonesia is hoping to revive that long lost tradition...I doubt it, but the lure of dosh makes people do strange things.  Just look at everything surrounding this case; let alone what goes on in our own local sphere - the Rinehart family dispute for instance comes to mind.You don't even have to threaten to bump people off in order to extract moolah it seems.  Perhaps threatening such an ultimate end just ups the ante, and ties up lose ends if those being pressured don't cough up.  There's no need to feed a corpse, but keeping them alive costs...

27 Apr 2015 3:07:43pm@jimbobto be fair, the most civilized people and society in the classical part of Europe, until the dawn of the Renaissance, are the Romans.Were they just? Well in their world, yes. Were they civilized? Well, they fed convicts and slaves to the lions in front of a blood thirsty crowd while while holding the barbarians at bay.What I am getting at is, morals alone don't make civilized man and his society. Social cohesion, growth, innovation and a strong defense is what makes a successful civilization.Just ask the Mayans who practiced human sacrifice, or the Inquisition who conquered them after. Who is to say these two weren't at the height of civilization at their reign?

27 Apr 2015 4:35:00pmThe Romans had "Social cohesion" "growth" "innovation" (their walls and roads still exits and some are still used!) and strong defences. During the period of the 12 emperors they were also bloodthirsty as you have pointed out.The Periclean Athenians had neither social cohesion or marked growth but they certainly had brilliant innovation (as we all bask in their light 2500 years on) and they had fair to middling defences - they barely lasted 50 years but hey! What a generation! Has the world seen anything like it since?I beg to differ with you - but it is "morals" i.e. the way we relate with one another that makes all the difference. There are many competing civilizations even today.I'm quite happy to speak my mind without fear here

27 Apr 2015 5:21:13pm@jimbobI guess my definition of a successful civilization includes longevity of said civilization. To me, even a Utopian society is not worth mentioning if it fails to stay alive for a generation. Pointless when you enjoy heaven on earth but give nothing to the next generation. Morals plays a part in social cohesion, but like the people in that society, morals are relative and fickle as the people who hold them.

Locals?  Chinese?We already know that had they been local terrorists, we would not protest at all.  In fact we approved.It seems to me that the issue is that Australians are not against the death penalty per se, but against the death penalty for Australians guilty of certain crimes we feel are "not too bad".  Had it been Ivan Milat facing execution in 72 hours I suspect the outcry would be more muted.I believe that most Australians would probably not be too worried about the reintroduction of the death penalty here, despite the consensus around the ABC water-coolers and the inner city elites.  They definitely don't care about it being carried out by our neighbours.Whatever the case, the time to work for the removal of the death penalty is not in some increasingly embarrassingly desperate-looking media frenzy, but through quiet diplomacy.  Preferably when we cannot be accused of having a direct interest.But of course if no likeable Australians are involved, we don't care.

27 Apr 2015 7:04:19pmThere is a large body of social psychology evidence that suggests that birds of a feather do indeed flock together. The chances of you spending time and speaking to people that agree with you are higher for various reasons. Anecdotal evidence about the apparently large number of people you know doesn't count for much, but its not this I want to talk about. Unfortunately, you can't be a cultural relativist when globalisation is accelerating, and we have so much contact with South East Asian nations.  What we need to ask ourselves if A) whether we are categorically against the death penalty or not, regardless of crime and B) whether we think the Australian government and people should fight for Australian law (rather than Indonesian law) to be applied to Australian citizens. The argument that their crime affects Indonesian people (and thus should be punished under Indonesian law) falls apart under scrutiny, as all crimes and actions have this international ripple effect (see globalisation), moreover there is significant evidence of the corruption of the judicial process, something that we should really care about... not to care is far from leaving them to "die in peace" and more like wilful ignorance. This is all without mentioning the ineffectiveness of the death penalty to deter crime, the coercion of desperate people to smuggle drugs, and the corruptibility of the law itself. Specifically, if you legislate for the death penalty, the system CAN NOT be corruptible. This is, of course, impossible, which is why we should not be so flippant about the taking of lives, criminal or not.
Alert moderator
27 Apr 2015 11:19:42pmThe argument Eve is not so much that the Bali9 crime was directly affecting Indonesian people and it is just that Indonesia just has a significant communities drug problem they want to do something about and execution for particular crimes is part of their policies, be it applicable to Indonesians or foreigners.That said, just as in Australia, foreigners are subject to our laws regardless of what country a person comes from, so be it that when in Indonesia, Indonesian laws apply just as in any country regardless of globalisation.As with the old saying " When in Rome, do as Romans would "
Alert moderator
28 Apr 2015 9:51:57amThat IS the argument for "leaving them to die in peace" elsewhere in the comments i.e. "think about all the people in Indonesia they harm by drug smuggling". It doesn't work, as no one thinks about ALL the consequences of their actions, generally speaking. The law doesn't account for this, but I have written about it elsewhere. It is exactly the bit you gloss over that I am writing about "be it Indonesians or foreigners" I understand this when in Rome idea in theory, but in practice it is not so clear cut as that. If it was, this would not be an issue. Moreover, it SHOULD NOT be this simple, otherwise Australian citizens who have committed no crime could find themselves caught up in a corrupt justice system, with no help from the government. You might say "but these men are guilty" and it would be a fair point, but the government cannot cherry pick who we help and who we do not, and I hope everyone can understand why exactly this might be. They are citizens, no matter their crime. Moreover, deciding who is guilty and who is not depends on the justice system being uncorrupted..That's exactly the problem with the 'when in Rome' type of sentiment, its reductionistic, something we should definitely avoid when deciding matters of innocent/guilty, and who to help and who not to, because the path to committing a crime is just not that simple. But probably even more, this sentiment sounds a bit like "when not in Rome, why should I even care what happens, its so far away..", the same thinking applied to things that affect us elsewhere in the world.  And for the record, I do care about how many people the Chinese and US governments put to death, because sovereign borders and sovereign law falls apart when people travel and trade (and aid) so much between nations.

28 Apr 2015 9:11:45amI agree Eve. We shouldn't forget either these facts:1) that the death penalty also smashes the lives of the families involved far far more than a life sentence and the family has done nothing wrong to deserve their shattered lives. Imagine a mother's heartbreak in this scenario in Indonesia. A life sentence, which in this case I also don't totally agree with, at least allows them to live and for family to have contact2) Courts can get it wrong!!! What if an innocent man is executed!?! You can't undo that!!! We see quite often new evidence emerge in cases which result in the conviction being overturned. If the 'convicted criminal' is in jail and have their conviction overturned then they can be set free. Can't do that if they have been executed

Furthermore, it is my observation that such criticism of Indonesia's sovereign right to conduct its own affairs is coming from the very quarters who would also criticise Western Imperialist strategy over non-western countries and their resource.

There are those who argue, quite rightly in my view, that powerful Western countries should respect a country's sovereignty in such negotiations yet at now arguing black and blue for Western interference into a country's legal procedures.By arguing that some should be treated differently is a direct appeal to personal privilege on the grounds of citizenship.

27 Apr 2015 4:15:22pmTabanus, regarding your 4th sentence; perhaps you haven't noticed but Andrew Chan is Chinese and the other bloke is hardly a typical Anglo Saxon/Celtic type Aussie. Sure they're both Australian citizens and rightfully our government should fight for its citizens but its not obliged to save the world. other governments should fight for their own nationals.As far as paedophiles and murderers go, I think you'd have a hard time convincing many that they shouldn't get the chop.

27 Apr 2015 5:52:03pmMy apology for being unclear.I did not mean Chinese as in ethic type or ancestry, I meant nationality.I don't normally categorise people by "race", it being a meaningless exercise.And the whole point of my post was that we claim to be against the death penalty, but only when it involves Australians.

27 Apr 2015 5:29:27pmIf we took a more pragmatic, realistic approach to the death penalty imagine the funds that could be freed up to spend on good things like education and health care. Is the cost of keeping an animal like Ivan Milat alive per year worth two nurses or two teachers or one doctor?
Alert moderator
27 Apr 2015 5:57:26pm"It seems to me that the issue is that Australians are not against the death penalty per se, but against the death penalty for Australians guilty of certain crimes we feel are "not too bad"."Australians have many and varied views on many and varied things, but the position of Australia as a sovereign nation is that it opposes the death penalty for all peoples and all crimes.This is why Australia demanded an assurance that the American accused of murdering his newlywed wife a few years back would not face the death penalty before allowing his extradition.
Alert moderator
27 Apr 2015 2:55:50pmI am not in favour of the death penalty and it is difficult to imagine the anguish of the condemned men.I note that in the ten years since their arrest, there have been over 400 executions in the United States alone; most not even raising a passing comment from the Australian media.One can't help but wonder why our outrage is so selective.

27 Apr 2015 3:12:02pm"One can't help but wonder why our outrage is so selective."At least one US state is bringing back the firing squad, so there's not even that for those who want to compare the US with Indonesia on technical detail. Other US states are going with a nitrogen gas chamber (nitrogen is not poisonous, it's just inert so the victim axphixiates). They had the lethal injection but they can't, ironically, get the good drugs any more.Anyone boycotting Indonesia or trying some other form of economic protest is going to have to start avoiding all imported goods I think if they're avoiding allegations of hypocrisy.

27 Apr 2015 3:12:48pmAh me! Once again a Drum poster singles out the USA. Why am I not surprised.Last year, there were 37 executions in the USA, which I will admit, is a great friend of Australia.But then China, our biggest trade customer, executed at least 1,000 in 2014.  Probably a lot more: it doesn't make the number public.  Unlike the USA, which agonises publically over each death.And the USA is of course is a democracy, allowing its citizens to decide on whether to have the death penalty on the books.But let's concentrate on that well known bad boy of the world.PS Several countries still have public executions: not the USA so not obviously not worth mentioning.

27 Apr 2015 4:47:17pmTabanus, if I expected China to have the same human rights as the US I'd be setting myself up to be very disappointed. We all know China is a dictatorship with harsh censorship and crackdowns on political expression. We are all told that the US is not anything like that. Yet they're executing a disproportionally high number of folks from racial minorities or with mental/intellectual disorders, because 'democracy' according to you.

Of course, the Indonesia-bashers (and their associates in organized crime) conveniently ignore this.In Australia, foreigners seeking asylum have less legal rights.As a more mundane example, foreigners in Russia have to pay more than locals to get intro museums.Lesson: if you don't want to be treated as a foreigner, don't go overseas.
Alert moderator
27 Apr 2015 2:59:54pmThe thing that I find interesting about the Indonesian attitude toward "foreigners" is that everyone seems to be treated as though they are citizens of former colonial powers.  They seem to forget that we too were once a colony of the British Empire and that we were no more "colonial masters" than they.  (Yes, I realise PNG comes into the argument, but cite East Timor as a counter point to this.)The other thing that makes it all seem a bit odd is the way that they seem to want to do the executions as a "job lot".  This makes it appear to be less of a matter of dispensing justice than drumming up some publicity for political purposes.

27 Apr 2015 8:07:38pmInteresting.  I suppose it comes down to the significance of "significant".I look at the numbers and immediately think that something is out of whack and that something needs doing about it.   I would have thought that any statistic that is substantially out of line with the general population needs further investigation.  These numbers are clearly out of kilter with general population statistics.Perhaps another way to look at it is to consider that the two major Parties sit on a primary vote of around 33%.   I think they consider this significant as they tend to regard it as grounds to claim a "clear madate" for anything they do after an election. The only significance of 50% is that it signifies the point at which a majority is reached.

28 Apr 2015 11:41:27amYou don't go to prison without committing a crime.  Are you suggesting that the Australian legal system should use genetic racial profiling, to allow some people with particular genetic ancestry, to get away without the same punishment that others committing the same crimes would be put in prison for?  Whatever the ratio of genetic background of people in Australian prisons is really irrelevant. The fact is that they committed a crime, exactly the same as the others in there.  They're not in prison for nothing.

The bigger crime these kids committed was not having enough money to do that.They were always going to be executed. It's been good sport for the Indonesians to make us go through the processes and beg for their lives. Imagine what these kids have been through on the roller coaster of false hope.

Locals are judged less harshly, and gotten away with literally murder.But I am not talking about Indonesia. I am referring to Australia. Idiots, high on drugs and alcohol, stole cars and got involved in a police pursue. Ran a few red-lights and killed others who happened to be in the wrong place, and at the wrong time. A few years behind bars if they are unlucky. A probation if they are lucky. This is our justice system.Then we get really outraged about Indonesia for having the dealing out hash sentences to "OUR" people. That is not right. Because our people are being harmed, we now find all kinds of excuses, accusations, claim of victimization, and even as severe as bribery. Lawyers are really digging up all corners of the legal garden to find that needle of excuses. Time to give it a rest. Two potential live takers. They took the chance and lost.

The belief that any failed appeal MUST elevate the original sentencing as punishment for wasting the court's time & resources?3. The belief that its fun watching all the foreign governments turn blue protesting over Indonesia's right to its own sovereign decisions?4.

27 Apr 2015 6:10:06pmInquisitorial versus adversarial, corruption or not, death penalty or not. All are valid issues to debate and discuss. These two men knowingly and repeatedly played their chances with the former. In doing so, they also played Russian roulette with the lives of the other seven of the Bali Nine. I do not support the death penalty but I am hearing no suggestions of boycotting the US for its use of the death penalty. Is the current opposition by so many Australians against the death penalty imposed by other countries in their legal systems selective? Is it based on the type of crime or the legal system they hold (ours or the inquisitorial)? I despair for these two men and cannot imagine the horror of this outcome for them or their families. It is a barbaric way to treat people and a barbaric way to die. We still have to live, however, with the fact they knew what they were doing, they conspired others less fortunate than them to be mules, and they knew the consequences. Indonesia did not keep their laws and the consequences secret. Young people make bad decisions. Some are ill informed and others are informed but choose to take the chance anyway repeatedly. Regardless of our opinions on the laws or legal processes in Indonesia, that information was freely known when these two men repeatedly committed their crimes. Their choices as 24 and 21 year olds risks the lives of the other seven, the victims of the product they were organising the transfer of and has now cost the Australian taxpayer financially and diplomatically with a country that was enforcing its legal system the way it does. I still hope for a reprieve or a change of mind by the Indonesian President. If that does not happen, I am grateful that the others in the Nine have been spared.

27 Apr 2015 6:10:48pmI feel for the two Australians and their families however I cannot understand why we keep pointing the finger at Indonesia when we turn a blind eye to the many inmates that are about to be executed by our biggest ally, the United States. Do we care for the many African Americans or Latino in death row in the U.S. Even though some will be proven innocent in a few years? No, we don't. So why make such a big noise about Indonesia. They knew the consequences, and if they didn't get caught, they would have imported more drugs into Australia. Time to get real, you do the crime, you do the time, simple. i don't believe in the death penalty but it's not my place to judge the laws of a sovereign country.

The amount of drug trafficking into and from Indonesia was, is and will be the same before, during and after the execution of these low level functionaries, including the trafficked domestic servant from the Philippines. It really is not about deterrence. Every thinking person knows that. Widodo must know it too. The president who cannot stand on the strength of his own leadership has resorted to this xenophobic fraud of a judicial process to lift his own popularity. Poll driven executions of foreigners is a new low, even for Indonesia.
Alert moderator
27 Apr 2015 7:00:47pmThe death penalty would be a deterrent to me for drug trafficking. I am a bit over this argument that it doesn't work. How do you know and how do you know that any others were just the same innocents sucked in by the same dealers using the same model from the past? The interesting thing is that those countries that have it for murder and other similar crimes are executing people with profound mental health issues. Death row inmates in the US do not socialise freely nor have the option, in doing so, to be given a pardon for rehabilitation. They are often isolated like animals. As awful as this outcome seems to be now, it also seems the Indonesians have at least given a lot of freedoms to these two unfortunate young men in the time of their incarceration. I refer back to my previous post regarding the support or otherwise for the different legal systems, and I ask again that in the context of the system that has been long-established and long-known of the Indonesian system that we respect it, despair by it, and also give them credit for their consideration of all Australians in jail over there for these crimes in letting their families have access to them regularly. We should not forget the embarrassment of the Corby case. Every prominent person in this country came out in support of her and her innocence. They threw money at her and her family and discredited Indonesia in the process. That support changed a lot as reality swept in. The Australian people need to ask the question as to how much generosity has been given to earlier drug smugglers from our country and caught in Indonesia. If these men are executed this is a question that needs to be answered.

27 Apr 2015 6:12:41pmAfter how many years of legal action has this decision finally come to an almost certainty?The lack of justice is the length of time which Indonesian society had to pay for, which extended the stress to the families and which provided an unnecessary delay.  The length of time appears to be due to the defendants lawyers.  Its these lawyers whilst lining their own pockets that created the injustice.  Two people where caught transporting drugs in a region that has a known death penalty for transporting drugs.  This is not denied by any side.  Perhaps the law is wrong.  The thing is, it is the law.  If you dont want to risk the maximum penalty for breaking the law, an easy solution is not to break the law.  The lack of justice has been compounded by the Australian government and media outlets.  Australia is far more equal in opinion than others let on.  Tripple J learned this the hard way.  Australia is divided whether these criminals should die.  Australia is also irellavent whether these criminals should die.  How would we react if Indonesia wanted to interfere in our legal system?  This is what many Australians are trying to do to theirs.

27 Apr 2015 6:49:46pmI wonder what the context is  in the Indonesian political and justice system.Maybe the leader wants to appear tough on crime for political gain , a common technique everywhere.maybe judicial inconsistency and or appearance of corruption lead to the same thing to appear above reproach.But it is naturally  more acceptable locally to be more severe on foreigners.The USA could also do with a shakeup on the death penalty.Any takers?

27 Apr 2015 6:58:43pmDeath Penalty is wrong, IMHO, serves no purpose. As a nation Australia abolished this in the 60's not much more than 50 years ago. In the world some 100 countries still list Death Penalty, some 60+ actively carry out this. If we are to complain about the Death Penalty we must be consistent and do so to all, perhaps join in as voices with the United Nations.That would of course include such wonderful trading partners, USA, China, Vietnam, and many others. Add in recently visited Iran to that list, as well as our closest neighbor.Within the last 10 years I do recall that Singapore executed an Australian Citizen, we did not have anywhere near the outcry over that one. Do understand that Singapore are changing or have changed laws in this regard since that time.As for different approaches for citizens versus those that are not. Hardly something we can claim moral high ground on. In fact we are so bad at showing support for people who are citizens, think Guantanamo Bay of recent years it is not becoming of us to do so. Not that will stop our current and sadly worst PM we have ever had, Misogynist, Racist, Sexist bully boy that he is.Sadly I finish with the note that Indonesia is a a sovereign nation. Thus is within their rights to do as the law of that country states. Thus we will be saying goodbye as sad as that event will be.

27 Apr 2015 7:03:37pmIn a civilized society the justice system is supposed to give offenders - and especially the young ones - a second chance. This is what terms like "rehabilitation" and "correction" are all about. Most of us know people who have made drug related offences especially at a young age. Having them executed in cold blood for that, is unimaginable.  Regardless of culture differences and particularities, fundamental human rights should be respected by every nation, that is if they want to be part of the civilized world. After ten years in prison, instead of getting killed in cold blood those people should be able to make a new start.

28 Apr 2015 7:31:39ampete;  There is no question that the death penalty is there and it is understandable there is measured sympathy for drug smugglers. However a key issue here is that justice in this regard is not dispensed equally (as evidenced by almost all being executed being foreigners) and the executions are forming part of an anti foreign campaign to divert attention away from government ineptitude.  Australia is being indirectly humiliated by this anti foreign campaign.  Note the coins collection campaign to mock Australia's aid and loss of lives in the Aceh operation.  There there is the announcement of the executions on ANZAC day.  Australia simply cannot afford to allow these attacks to continue without a severe rebuke to Indonesia.

27 Apr 2015 9:07:27pm.. so from what i've gleaned about this story so far (after all these months in the news but only barely paying attention) is that a bunch of really young stupid guys in their very early 20's made a really bad decision to recruit others to lugg ' a tonne of druggs' to somewhere else 'for lots of money' right ?.. i don't recall where 'the stuff' was actually from nor where it was going to or how it was being paid for & who would profit from this scheme .. and it all happened what a decade ago or so .. and what we hear now is that they are much more 'nice' ... older & wiser ..As a parent of a couple of sons who now at the age of making their own jaw-dropping 'inexplicable' choices .. i wring my hands & heartstrings over what to me seems clearly futile attempts to forge 'meaning' and 'identity' however hollow .. with no thought to repercussions ..... so what do we say to our young ones in these days of ANZAC & ISIS ... what glory 'worth' the risk to die for .. lots of money & maybe a fancy car ?? .. i have people in my life who've (barely) survived heroin and heard their stories about bravado & struggle ... and their friends who didn't make it & died young .. for no reason really ... because there wasn't much else really going on ..... sad stories .. but what do we do ..... maybe recognise that yes we are all actually, inevitably caught up in bigger schemes no matter what we think or do .. be it 'king pins' or 'demagouges' .. but then what do we make of our options .. our choices ? our possiblities ?? .. i didn't quite get Hamlet or Dead Man starring Johnny Depp ... but i've an inkling there's a bigger story ... sincerely ..

27 Apr 2015 10:29:54pmThere was a time when there was a zero tolerance on drugs policy of sorts being pushed by the Australian government and now we have not only the government members but seemingly much of the opposition, 140 odd MPs signing their own protest regardless of what Australians might think.Essentially it could be said that Australia has a heap of MPs supporting drug traffickers and that even with Julie Bishop announcing last December that government policy would not include support for Australians overseas who get into trouble by their own actions.Next thing that could likely occur is that because Chan has married someone in Indonesia, she will be granted an Australian residency visa.Where will it end we might ask and it would certainly seem as the people who get elected as our representatives have very little by way of intestinal fortitude.They need to stand up and let Indonesia get on with running their own country.

27 Apr 2015 10:42:54pmLaw is law. Everyone must obey the law without any exception. Anybody who come to a country and do crime must be aware of the law. Indonesia is a law-based nation. Ever since many years ago, there has been death penalty for this extraordinary crime. It's clear if someone breaks the law, they are ready for the penalty.There are about 50 people in Indonesia who die because of narcotics each day. This is clearly the sovereignity of Indonesia to save its citizens from narcotics and implement the law. No one or country is able to interfere Indonesian judicial system.Everyone has right. Yes, you have right but your right is limited by other people's right. Everyone has the right to live, but if you take other's right to live, directly or not, you lost that right man.

27 Apr 2015 11:41:24pmPoor old Indonesia. It lost its country to the Dutch, the Japanese, and (in the case of East Timor) Conoco Phillips with Australia doing the USA's dirty work as usual. It had to swallow its pride and accept a billion in tsunami aid from those rich, idle, boozy bogan infidels in Bali. Of course the new President will milk this opportunity with nationalistic xenophobic fervour. 'Separation of powers doctrine? Apa itu?'On the other hand, seeing the devastation hard drugs (like alcohol, cigarettes, heroin and crystal meth) cause on Australian communities makes me want to offer my services as executioner. They knew what they were doing, they made a lot of money out of previous trips (wait for the AFP reports to mud-spatter their media martyrdom) and now they are paying tbe piper (or the jail governor for new passports and a boat to freedom).Such is life.

27 Apr 2015 11:51:07pmThe Indonesian legal system is Indonesian, not Australian, not American, not British. It is what it is, and after 10-years of due diligence in this system the original verdict has been upheld. The point here is that the traffickers' new the risks, would have been happy to succeed and spread drugs and death in this country, but now after being caught are sorry? Are perhaps even reformed? Really the point is being missed, they committed a capital crime in Indonesia, were tried and convicted under Indonesian law, and will now face punishment under that same law. In my view they had a fair trial under the Indonesian system. Indonesia is a sovereign nation, they must respect our laws and we must as a nation respect theirs, you do not have to agree with it, you do not have to like it, but as a sovereign nation you must respect it. Australians outside of Australia are on their own, the support for these criminals if replicated for the general public overseas would be wonderful, but it isn't and it smacks of political opportunism of the worst kind. I feel sorry for their families, but support the decision of a sovereign nation to govern within their legal framework. I also do not believe foreigners are over represented, this statement is a misnomer, break the law and face the consequences, it is not about quotas. The higher the profile, the harsher the consequences - this applies almost everywhere in Asia - live with it is my advice, cheers.

28 Apr 2015 3:46:09amI can think of four reasons why Indonesia should not execute the pair; two of self-interest, one practical and one vindictive.1. The AFP will cease tipping off the Indonesians, fearing a backlash at home, resulting in more drugs on Indonesian streets.2. The whole country looks hypocritical when calling for Indonesian citizens to be spared the death penalty in foreign lands. (Just like we did Howard said of Amrozi, "I wont be sorry [if they execute him]")3. Death penalties have been shown time and again not to deter crime. Criminals just don't believe they will get caught; in their minds it's just a bigger thrill.4. Killing a major criminal is letting them off lightly. Better to let them rot in gaol, and leave open the possibility of learning from them.
Alert moderator
28 Apr 2015 10:05:00amThose may be your thoughts jfk and then it could well be that1. The AFP will always continue with international interaction, including Indonesia.2. It is not necessarily hypocritical for a country to have a view of helping citizens abroad whilst maintaining death penalties within their own country and Indonesia are not alone in doing that if you consider the USA.3. Many people will claim that death penalties have no deterrence on crime just as there are many people who will think twice before getting involved in crime and particularly more so if they may face execution.As for the thrill you claim, all the more reason to keep executing more and more to save repeat events.4. If you are happy to pay for letting criminals rot in gaols, fine but do not do it with my taxes.
Alert moderator
28 Apr 2015 11:39:16am1. No, jfk, the AFP will not stop cooperating with Indonesia. 2. The Indonesians have doubtlessly weighed this up and have decided that the application of their laws outweighs the possibility of looking hypocritical overseas. 3. Deterrence is not the only reason for the death penalty in Indonesia. The death penalty exists there because the Indonesians believe that there are some actions that deserve it. 4. The Indonesians do not wish to keep them locked up for the next 50 years and their laws do not obligate them to.

28 Apr 2015 6:47:49amLet's just stick to the facts without the sob story. These were not two young individuals on holiday caught with their holiday stash, they were two ringleaders who convinced 7 other desperate individuals to smuggle drugs into a country with harsh penalties for drug smuggling. They planned this, were perhaps part of a 'bigger picture', and led 7 others to a similar fate. We could have been hearing of nine executions instead of two.I, for one, am sick of the constant media feeds on these two men, oh and Shapelle Corby too. Our problem is that we have too lenient penalties in all areas of crime in our country (and no I don't advocate for the death penalty, just stop giving too many chances to re offenders), so we are shocked at foreign judicial systems and their sentences given to our countrymen when they break the law in other countries. Seems to me we haven't moved too far from our convict roots!

28 Apr 2015 1:12:15pmIt appears to me the more Muslim the Indonesian President is, the more ready they are to impose sharia penalties.This President's strict Muslim views are the cause of this "death penalty" scenario.The previous less Muslim President did not persue these policies.So my view is, it appears Islamic societies that practice sharia law are less " humane" than first world countries like Australia.Indonesian corruption is a third world curse that Indonesia seems to be happy with.Everyone is corrupt, everyone gets kickbacks, everybody is happy.While Indonesia is following its "own laws"in dealing with criminals. It is clear these laws can change and unfortunately the more Islamic the country is the more cruel and barbaric some of its practices will become.  The death penalty is the start.All Australia can do besides complain is to not go there for holidays, which ineffect fuels corruption anyway and actively not buy Indonesian products.All the talk and complaints in the world will do less to effect change than taking the dollars out of the corrupt Indonesian system.Someone else suggested Thailand is cleaner, safer and you are less likely to become a victim if something goes wrong.

I have children the same age as Chan and Sukumaran and I can't imagine the horror that they, or their families are going through. The real inhumanity is the torment they have been subjected to with the media frenzy over the last few months. Waiting to know their fate - what this must do to your mind! When my kids travel overseas the one thing I tell them over and over is that they need to stay safe and that they need to understand the laws in the countries they travel to. And how extreme the punishment can be.

28 Apr 2015 3:29:15pmRastus, while it is true the known penalty of law has been served on these criminals, it is also apparent that this law is not applied equally.  Australian governments have made much of the special relationship with Indonesia justifying substantial foreign aid, it is apparent from this episode that no such relationship exists in their minds.  We should adjust our approach accordingly.

28 Apr 2015 3:31:25pmRastus - much of what you say is true about crime and punishment in third world countries. What you have failed to realise it that the people on Indonesias death row, more than likely committed their crimes when the death sentence was not actively pursued.The now more Islamic President has changed the application of laws so that it is only now that the death sentence is actively persued.The above crimes were committed under a non-death sentence regime. But, are now judged and sentenced to death under changes made to make Indonesia more Islamic in its sentencing and practices.Have some mercy for those who have been trapped in this corrupt country for crimes they may not have committed and do not play their "give me the money or die games".Indonesia is  actively seeking to have its own citizens/criminals become exempt from the death penalty overseas, when serious crimes have been committed.This proves the Indonesian system is not even handed but, hypocritical and corrupt.

How did we get to see the "artist" painting the execution dates onto the crosses to be used with the coffins? And today when the families have arrived to visit their loved ones - probably for the last time. They have had to walk all the way up to the gates with the media surrounding them like a pack of vultures. What was different about today compared to other days when the transport was able to take them all the way to the gates to provide some small amount of privacy? The Indonesians seem very happy with the outcome.... but will it make any difference in deterring drug smuggling? I think not.
