Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has refused to be drawn on how much he donated to Liberal Party coffers in the lead-up to last year's federal election.An initial search by the ABC failed to find any evidence of a donation by Mr Turnbull or any companies listed in his register of interests in the latest figures issued by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC).Donations made in the final days of the election — on July 1 or 2 — will not be disclosed until next year, and Mr Turnbull has never confirmed if he made any donations ahead of the election.He has also repeatedly refused to comment on reports that he donated more than $1 million to the Liberal Party. When pressed on the issue after his address to the National Press Club today, Mr Turnbull declined to name a figure. "My donations to the Liberal Party have been regular and generous, and I would encourage others to do the same," he said."They've always been disclosed in accordance with the law."Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce defended the Prime Minister's action, telling the ABC his donations were "completely legit"."He chose to donate to the party he's the leader of," Mr Joyce said."If he's donated a heap of money because he's got a heap of money, well good luck to him. God bless him, it's his right."Mr Turnbull also spoke on the need for donation reform, signalling the potential for change in the rules governing foreign contributions. "Overseas events, as well as those here in Australia, have shown us that the Australian people must be confident that our electoral process is free from foreign intervention or interference," he said."The joint standing committee on electoral matters is examining this complex issue, but I believe Australians expect us to ensure that only Australians, and Australian businesses, can seek to influence Australian elections." Chinese donors have contributed millions to both major political parties since 2013, including $715,000 to the Liberal Party in the past financial year from Hong Kong Kingston Investment Co. Ltd, headed by Chau Chak Wing.Mr Chau is linked to a partly state-backed newspaper, the Australian New Express Daily, launched by then NSW premier Bob Carr in 2004.He is also president of the Association of Australia China Friendship and Exchange.Opposition Leader Bill Shorten also called for reform today, saying he does not want foreign donations "distorting Australian politics".Mr Shorten also criticised the Prime Minister for the delay in publicising any potential donations."I don't understand why Malcolm Turnbull thinks it should be a secret how much he gave to the Liberal Party," he said."He's going to have to tell someone, at some point it's going to be public... It sounds tricky, it looks shifty."Mr Shorten added that Labor politicians paid a proportion of their salary to the party.The latest AEC figures show that the Liberal Party received almost $15 million in donations throughout 2015-16, up from about $10.3 million the previous year.The Labor Party received more than $10.3 million in donations, up from $7.3 million in 2014-15.
