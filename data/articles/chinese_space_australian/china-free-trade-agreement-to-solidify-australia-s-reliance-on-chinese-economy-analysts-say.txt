Even before the expected announcement this week of a free trade agreement with the world's biggest nation, Australia's economic future has grown increasingly entwined with that of China.Already our largest trading partner, last year Australia exported over $100 billion in goods and services to China, which now accounts for more than 35 per cent of all Australian trade."We've seen Australian agriculture in the last ten years go from $3 billion to $8 billion in exports to China," said Simon Talbot, chief executive of the National Farmers Federation.And he is upbeat about the prospect of the new trade agreement."I think it heralds a golden era for Australian agriculture," he said.There is, however, considerable concern about the economic outlook for China before that agreement is signed. On a recent visit to Melbourne the chairman of the Chinese Mining Association, Wang Jiahua, acknowledged his country's economic slowdown."China is now restructuring ... so (we are) changing the gears," he said.The problem for Australia is that when China slows down, the impact is profound on exporters.China is cutting back on the heavy government stimulus and easy credit that had turbo charged the Chinese economy.As a result, the price of Australia's biggest export, iron ore, has fallen around 40 per cent since December. Australian miners invested heavily to ramp up production to feed Chinese growth and the slowing Chinese economy is hurting many Australian iron ore producers."You've seen jobs being lost," said Mitch Hooke, the former chief executive of the Minerals Council of Australia."The bottom line is that there are a number of projects that are not going ahead, a number that are shutting down, a number that are scaling back."We're seeing a focus on costs or the austerity phase, you know how they call it ... the challenge for the industry is that it doesn't become a foetal position."Leading international economist Noriel Roubini, who is famous for predicting the global financial crisis, recently predicted that the Chinese economy would continue to deteriorate. "I believe that China could fall towards a growth rate of 6 per cent or below in the next couple of years," Ms Roubini said."That's a very bumpy landing for China and will have an impact also on commodity prices and through a variety of trade channels in the global economy."Roubini Economics predicts Australia's economy will slow markedly next year, effecting government revenues, prompting a 20 per cent slump in the dollar and requiring further interest rate cuts.Trade Minister Andrew Robb said that forecast is overly pessimistic. "We might feel a bit of a road bump," Mr Robb told the ABC's 7.30."But if there is a bit of a road bump we will pick up steam very quickly beyond that because I think so many factors are coming together which is all good news for Australia."The Government is excited that a free trade deal with China will be a game-changer for Australian exporters from agriculture to financial services.David Morfesi served as senior trade negotiator in the Office of US President, where he negotiated the free trade deal with Australia.He has since moved to Australia and said his adopted country should not get too excited about its latest trade deal."China is already our biggest trading partner and the idea of liberalising trade with your biggest partner is logical," Mr Morfesi said."Because we sign a free trade agreement this week, next week, next month doesn't mean that the benefit is coming this week, next week, next month.We have very much targeted the region as our first priority but without ignoring the rest of the world. "It means that we are starting a relationship that's going to lead to sustainable economic growth." Like iron ore, the Australian wool industry has developed a heavy dependence on China.  "Definitely China is slowing," said James Thompson of Australian Merino Exports."In the last 10-15 years they've taken up to 85 per cent of the clip from Australia."In the last 12 months that's dropped to around 65 per cent."I just don't think any commodity wants one particular country to be so powerful. I think you need diversity."Mr Robb said that while the trade agreement with China will be significant, it is only part of the overall strategy."We're looking after Australia's national interests," he said."We have very much targeted the region as our first priority but without ignoring the rest of the world." "This is our first priority and China's a big part of it."
