The Australian share market has continued on from its losses last week, losing ground again in the wake of falls overseas.The mining sector helped minimise the damage though, rising strongly on better-than-expected trade data out of China.The All Ordinaries index finished the session 33 points or 0.6 per cent lower at 5,153, while the ASX-200 also lost 33 points to 5,156.Once again finance stocks weighed on trade, with Westpac falling 1.1 per cent, the Commonwealth Bank 0.9 per cent, ANZ 0.7 per cent and NAB 0.3 per cent.Qantas stocks dropped 3.7 per cent as it emerged the airline is nearing its upper limit of 49 per cent foreign ownership.Rival Virgin Australia also fell, closing 1.3 per cent lower.Retailers also suffered, with Myer losing 1.6 per cent and JB Hi-Fi 1.5 per cent.The food and beverage sector managed to avoid losses, however, with Coca Cola Amatil adding 1.3 per cent and Treasury Wine Estates gaining 2.2 per cent.Miners also avoided losses, with Rio Tinto rising 1.9 per cent and BHP Billition 0.9 per cent.Fortescue jumped 6.1 per cent while gold miner Newcrest added 0.7 per cent.The sector was boosted by an unexpected rise in Chinese imports last month, including Australian minerals.The official data out of China shows imports rose 7 per cent in September, despite analysts expecting them to fall slightly.Chinese exports also grew by more than 15 per cent, again a slightly better number than was predicted.The trade data also helped boost the Australian dollar.At 5:00pm (AEDT) the local currency was buying 87.4 US cents, 68.9 euro cents, 54.2 British pence, 93.6 Japanese yen and just under 111 New Zealand cents.Global oil prices were broadly stable, with West Texas crude selling for $US85.82 a barrel and Tapis crude in Singapore worth $US91.77 a barrel.
