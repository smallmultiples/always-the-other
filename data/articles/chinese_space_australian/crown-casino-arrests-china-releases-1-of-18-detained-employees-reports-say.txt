One of 18 Crown Resorts staff arrested in China in October for suspected "gambling crimes" has been released from detention, according to media reports.The detention of 18 Crown staff, three of whom are Australian nationals including its head of international VIP gambling, has sparked concern about the impact on Australian casinos which rely on wealthy Chinese gamblers.The Australian Financial Review reported that Jenny Jiang, who worked in administration for James Packer's gaming company in Shanghai, was released on bail on Thursday.Analysts have linked the detentions to Chinese laws banning casinos from advertising or promoting gambling in the Chinese mainland, such as offering credit to high-spending clients.VIP gambling delivered "less than 30 per cent" of revenue at Crown — which is Australia's top casino operator — with 80 per cent of that derived from VIP junkets from Asia, Star chairman John O'Neill said in October.One of Crown's rivals, Star Entertainment Group, has warned of uncertainty around future revenue from China following the arrests.
