Chinese consumers will be targeted through social media and bilingual digital platforms as part of an ambitious push to bolster a New South Wales wine region's global profile.Industry leaders in the Southern Highlands, south of Sydney, are embarking on a digital marketing campaign to draw more tourists from Asia and the USA.The campaign will involve having a website in 20 different languages, and using specific Chinese messaging channels such as WeChat and Sina Weibo to speak directly with prospective tourists.It is one of 21 projects across the country being supported by the national industry body Wine Australia to bolster the country's tourism sector.Destination Southern Highlands manager Steve Rosa said China was now Australia's number one market for wine."The Southern Highlands, together with a lot of other regional areas throughout Australia, have now got to be able to talk in the language and format the experiences that that particular market desires," Mr Rosa said."With China they don't operate in your traditional Google formats, so we're actually going to be playing their field to be able to talk to them in their language." The Southern Highlands is home to 17 cellar doors and more than 60 vineyards, and is just over an hour's drive to Sydney.While it does not enjoy the global profile of other, bigger wine regions such as the Hunter Valley and South Australia's Barossa Valley, Mr Rosa said its geographic location was a big selling point."Because of our close proximity to a quarter of Australia's population in Sydney, the Illawarra and Canberra, we're well-placed to attract visitors that are looking for culinary delights," he said. Mittagong winery owner Mark Bourne said leverage emerging communications platforms in Asian countries could present big opportunities for the local sector.Mr Bourne, who also heads up the local tourism and food association, believed they had an edge on other wine regions."We've got some really strong varieties around that are in vogue at the moment, so pinot noir, pinot gris," he said."Sparkling wines are really, really strong in the Southern Highlands."There's not many regions that do that, so we do have something quite unique to tell not only the domestic wine tourists but the international wine tourists as well."Lifting the profile of wine regions to Asian countries has also been in the NSW Government's sights, with a campaign unveiled last year involving Mudgee in the state's central-west being featured on buses and trams and in newspapers across Hong Kong.NSW Wine Industry Association executive officer Angus Barnes said the state's annual wine sales to China alone had increased by 73 per cent in March.He said the NSW wine regions had been early adopters in understanding the benefits of using new and more targeted communication channels."Not every country communicates in the same way we do, and WeChat is perhaps an incredible example where if you want to have a conversation with someone from China, it's one of the great platforms to do that," Mr Barnes said."It does take some time, it does take some effort, but we're seeing the progressive people right across the industry starting to embrace platforms like WeChat."
