The slowing Chinese economy, which has taken a further hit as global share markets tumble on the back of the Greek debt crisis, is far more significant for the Australian economic climate than what is happening in Europe, one analyst has warned.Markets across the world tumbled as Greece ordered its banks to shut for a week and imposed capital controls after its citizens emptied ATMs, following the European Central Bank's decision not to offer further emergency funds to keep banks afloat.International creditors have refused to extend Greece's bailout beyond its June 30 expiry date, sparking default fears over an IMF loan repayment due the same day.But while everyone's attention has been captured by the unfolding Greek crisis, China's markets and economy have also entered a turbulent time.Asian markets fell sharply on the collapse of Greek debt negotiations over the weekend, with a rate cut failing to prop up Chinese stocks which have been hardest hit.Morgans analyst Ken Howard said Australia needed to be keeping a closer eye on movement in China. "Greece, as far as its impact on corporate earnings here in Australia, is very, very modest, if anything at all," he told ABC's The Business program. "The slowing Chinese economy is far more significant for Australian corporates and the demand for our commodities."Mr Howard said a decision from China to cut rates on the weekend offered some longer-term hope for commodity prices."A cut in interest rates is certainly a positive but typically interest rate moves take six months, 12 months, 18 months to actually flow through to underlying demand," he said."It's going to be some time off before we see some recovery there in commodity prices."China is clearly a far more significant player globally and for Australia."Concerns have grown over a possible debt default by Greece this week, triggering a tumble in global share markets, with Australian stocks caught in the sell-off.European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker defended proposals rejected by Greece to resolve its debt crisis, adding that he feels a "little betrayed".The comments came after Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras blindsided creditors by calling a July 5 referendum on the austerity cuts in the aid package proposed by the creditors and announcing capital controls to prevent banks from collapsing. Mr Juncker said the referendum was a "moment of truth" for Greece, adding that Greek voters would be rejecting the European Union if they voted "No" on Sunday."After all the efforts I deployed from the commission, I feel betrayed because these efforts were insufficiently taken into account," Mr Juncker said, adding it would have led to no wage or pension cuts and created more social fairness."This is not a stupid austerity package."I will ask the Greek people to vote 'Yes'," he said, adding that one "should not commit suicide because one is afraid of death"."It's time for Greece's political leaders to show their responsibility to tell their people what's really at stake."Mr Juncker said turning around the ravaged Greek economy remained a huge challenge."It will not be easy, but it's necessary," he said."Others have done it, just ask the Irish, Portuguese, Spanish and Latvians," he said, referring to European countries that have previously implemented harsh austerity measures to get through economic crisis.The Greek government issued a decree to close banks until July 6 — the day after the referendum — with a 60-euro limit on cashpoint withdrawals. The stock exchange will also stay shut. Foreign tourists, a vital engine of the Greek economy, will be exempt.In a narrow ray of hope for Greece, creditors have left the door open to the country for a last-ditch debt deal, in order to try and avert a potentially calamitous default that could spark a Greek eurozone exit and raise serious questions about the future of the European Union.Mr Tsipras urged calm after ATMs across Greece ran dry."Any difficulties that may arise must be dealt with calmness. The more calm we are, the sooner we will get over this situation," Mr Tsipras said, adding Athens had again requested a "prolongation of the [bailout] program".The drastic measures — designed to protect Greece's banking system against the threat of mass panic — also sent the European single currency sliding.The rapid escalation of the Greek debt crisis came after the European Central Bank froze the level of its emergency lifeline for Athens on Sunday, despite a growing bank run.ABC/AFP
