Australia appears to be on the verge of joining a multi-billion-dollar Asian development fund, despite ongoing concerns from the United States about its governance and transparency arrangements.The Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank was launched late last year.As its name suggests, it is designed to help finance things like road, rail and power projects in the rapidly growing region. More than 20 countries have signed on as founding members. In the past month, major Western powers including Britain, France, Germany and Italy have also announced their intention to join.Australia has so far resisted joining the bank but Prime Minister Tony Abbott has hinted that this could change."We have made no final decision to join the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank but obviously we are considering it - we have been considering it one way or another for quite a few months now," he said."What we are considering ... is absolutely consistent with what we're doing domestically; we want to build infrastructure, we want to reduce tax, we want to get red tape down and we want to unleash the creativity of our people."Treasurer Joe Hockey said there was a lot of merit in joining the bank and said he had been speaking to his counterparts both in Europe and around the world about the proposal."We want to make sure there are proper governance procedures," he told 4BC radio."That there's transparency, that no one country is able to control the entity and we've been working with the Chinese government."We want Australian contractors involved; we want work for Australians out of this bank. And because it's operating in our region, in our neighbourhood, it is important that Australia fully understand and look at participating in this bank."The so-called China bank is seen as a rival to other multi-lateral banks including the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.The G20 recognised there was a great need for infrastructure funds in our region. Last year, Cabinet's powerful National Security Committee (NSC) rejected China's proposal for Australia to join on strategic grounds.It is understood that Foreign Minister Julie Bishop held deep reservations about the bank while Mr Hockey and Trade Minister Andrew Robb apparently supported it.But Fairfax is reporting that, five months later, the NSC has reversed its decision and has now given the green light for Australia to join.Australia could reportedly invest up to $3 billion in the bank, which could lead to a wave of infrastructure development across the Asia-Pacific.Ms Bishop will not confirm the report, stating she does not discuss matters that come before the NSC.However, she did say there are a number of benefits."The G20 recognised there was a great need for infrastructure funds in our region," she said."Globally there's a demand for productivity enhancing infrastructure so the concept is one that's very desirable at this particular time of the economic cycle."I don't believe for a moment that we need to choose between our strong and close relationship with the United States and our strong and close relationship with China. But Ms Bishop said she stands by her position that certain governance standards need to be met before Australia can join as a member."At present, the question is whether or not we would negotiate from the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding so there are several steps in this process and the first is to consider whether Australia will sign up to a MOU to negotiate membership of the bank," she said.When asked if she was concerned that information had been leaked from the NSC meeting, Ms Bishop said the Fairfax story was not an accurate representation of what happened in the meeting."So it's obviously not an accurate leak," she said.Labor's foreign affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek has called on the Government to join the bank since its launch late last year.Ms Plibersek said it made no sense that Australia had resisted joining for so long."We said that, of course, there should be proper transparency and governance arrangements but there is absolutely no reason why Australia should not be involved," she said."Australia has said more than once that as China, as it grows in economic strength, should play a larger role in the region and we've also said that our Asia-Pacific region is in desperate need of extra infrastructure spending."Ms Plibersek added that Australia should have joined the bank as one of the founding members to influence its priorities and governance arrangements.The United States remains deeply sceptical about the bank but Ms Plibersek said she did not think the diplomatic relationship with the US would be affected if Australia signed up."I don't believe for a moment that we need to choose between our strong and close relationship with the United States and our strong and close relationship with China," she said."It's in Australia's interests to work constructively with both of these nations."Mr Hockey echoed Ms Plibersek's sentiment."Because you know the United States Congress has been dragging its feet on the reform of the IMF, and the United States understands that this is a bank that's going to be operating in our region," he said.
