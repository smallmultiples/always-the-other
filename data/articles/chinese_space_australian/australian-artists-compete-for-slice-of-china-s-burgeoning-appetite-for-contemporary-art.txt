Cashed-up Chinese have been splashing out on real estate and luxury cars. Now they are turning to contemporary Western art to show off their cultural sophistication. The trend has seen key figures in Australia's art scene working hard to ensure Aussie artists are well positioned to gain exposure in the booming Chinese market.China is now the second-largest art market in the world, accounting for 21 per cent of the $US63 billion ($86.6 billion) generated in global art sales last year, according to the latest Art Basel and UBS Global Art Market Report.It is a seismic shift in the global art market — traditionally dominated by the established European and US markets — and artists, global auction houses, dealers and major galleries are all seeking to gain a foothold in the burgeoning market. While the Chinese have always had a passion for traditional Chinese art, according to global auction house Sotheby's, the surging interest in contemporary international art is a recent trend."Since about three years ago, people have been starting to look at other types of contemporary art beyond Chinese," Yuki Terase, Sotheby's head of contemporary art in Asia, said."That's been very much reflected in what we offer in our main sales."The nature of the market and the average age of the collectors is significantly younger than the other more mature and established markets like New York and London."Ms Terase said each year a new crop of young, image-conscious art buyers were fronting up to major auctions with their eye on acquiring a modern masterpiece."They have been studying up and getting educated, and their taste has been refined ever so quickly," she said."It is a very significant phenomenon that we're seeing." 2010 Archibald prize-winning artist Sam Leach is one artist leading the Australian art scene's foray into this new frontier.In 2010 he completed his first artistic residency in Beijing and since then has been part of numerous exhibitions across China, including Art Basel Hong Kong, Asia's leading contemporary art fair."Every time I've been to China, looking at the art scene, there's this sense of energy and optimism and momentum, and it's something that's really seductive and something we should really be a part of," he said. "Naturally, given our history, we as artists spend a lot of time looking to Europe and the US, but realistically the size of China and the potential for us to make contact and develop new works in relationship to Chinese artists is certainly much more significant.""There is so much for us to grasp with a bit of intention and a bit of effort."Prominent art advocate, Terry Wu, who was born in Taiwan to a traditional Chinese artist father, is now based in Melbourne, where he sits on a number of boards, including the National Association of Visual Arts.Each year he attends Art Basel Hong Kong, where one of his priorities is working to build links between Australia and China to help Australian artists gain recognition with Chinese galleries and buyers.He believes the growing interest in contemporary art in China is a unique phenomenon and one that provides Australian artists with unprecedented potential for sales and exposure. "Art works are very important for both culture as well as status, and let's face it, Chinese people love status," Mr Wu said.Mr Wu said once wealthy Chinese have managed to acquire high-status items such as real estate and luxury cars, they then look for a way to show off their cultural sophistication."They really want to feel part of this world. One of the ways to feel that they have increased in their stature and status is by driving European cars, and after they've done that they can acquire art," he said. The lust for that high-status recognition has seen strong demand for works by European masters, such as Vincent van Gogh, but Mr Wu said there was also a strong appetite for emerging artists, especially those who resonate with culture and tradition.He pointed to sculptor and video artist Lisa Roet as an example of an Australian artist who has managed to balance modern flair with Chinese sensibilities. "Her primary area of investigation is about primates — about monkeys and chimpanzees — and she has found a language which I think the Chinese art market appreciates."The motif of monkeys is very well-loved and common in Chinese culture, both in Zodiac as well as in mythology, so it's a very familiar type of topic that people are very fond of."She recently did a project with Design Shanghai, where she had very large-scale public art works."Mr Wu said there were also government efforts to help other Australian artists break into the market.Next month the Australia Council for Arts will take a delegation of local artists to the China Shanghai International Arts Festival and Performing Arts Fair, helping them build connections with international arts professionals, institutions and artists.For Mr Leach, whose work has also been strongly influenced by his ongoing relationships with Chinese culture and its people, building that connection is crucial.He believes Australia often overachieves in sport on a global stage, but it places far less emphasis on developing and promoting its artistic endeavours, which he feels are also world-class."Definitely there is the ability on the ground in Australia for that to occur," he said."China is really the obvious place to focus our attention on to make something like that happen."
