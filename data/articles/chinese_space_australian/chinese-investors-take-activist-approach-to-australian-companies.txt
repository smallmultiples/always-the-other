While the world looks on aghast at the carnage on the Shanghai and Shenzen exchanges, a new breed of Chinese investor has begun to wield power on the Australian Securities Exchange.In the past fortnight, three locally listed companies have been stung by a concerted attack from hostile Chinese interests who have adopted the tactics of western style activist investors to achieve their ends.Last Thursday, the corporate world was rocked by the summary dismissal of AusNet independent director Tony Ianello who was championing a tilt for the soon to be auctioned NSW electricity transmission group Transgrid.Ianello's removal has angered minority shareholders and raised questions about the company's governance given the Ausnet board had endorsed his re-election.AusNet's two biggest shareholders China State Grid Corporation and Singapore Power, aghast at the prospect of forking out $9 billion for the poles and wires outfit, joined forces at Ausnet's annual meeting to vote against Ianello's re-election.Such a bid may have required a massive capital raising and the two shareholders, which between them control 51 per cent of AusNet, reportedly were less than enthusiastic at that prospect although for entirely different reasons.For its part, Singapore Power with 31 per cent of AusNet, appears disinterested in being part of any bidding consortium while China State Grid is part of another Transgrid bidding consortium and did not want to be bidding against itself.The move has cast doubts as to whether a candidate could be found who could stand up for the rights of all shareholders given the company now has insufficient independents on the board.The next day, colourful Cudeco founder Wayne McCrae found himself out on the street after being dumped by three Chinese investors in his cash strapped group.China Oceanwide International Investment Co, Sinosteel Equipment and Engineering and New Apex Asia Investment joined forces to finally remove the man famous for his blue language and bold promises from the chair of the copper explorer.The ousting follows a failed capital raising last month amid dwindling cash reserves and a plunging copper price.A fortnight ago, another mining minnow Echo Resources suffered a similar fate when a Miss Mei Yen Tan and Mrs Sarah Cameron requisitioned a shareholder meeting to dump managing director Ernst Kohler.
