A mysterious piece of plane debris has washed up on the French Indian Ocean island of La Reunion, prompting speculation it could be part of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370.The two-metre-long piece of wreckage, which seemed to be part of a wing, was found by people cleaning up a beach on the small island east of Madagascar."It was covered in shells, so one would say it had been in the water a long time," one witness said.French air transport officials have already opened an investigation to find where the wreckage could have come from. A local official said it was too early to suggest it might be from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight.Malaysia has also sent a team to verify whether the debris could be part of the missing flight."Whatever wreckage found needs to be further verified before we can further confirm whether it belongs to MH370," transport minister Liow Tiong Lai said."So we have dispatched a team to investigate on this issue and we hope that we can identify it as soon as possible.""People are getting ahead of themselves over this," Eric Chesneau, an officer in the air transport police of the French Indian Ocean territory, said. "It is more than likely plane debris, [but] we don't know what exact part it may be."Aviation commentator Peter Clark said the wreckage was "definitely off an aircraft"."Whether it's off that aircraft, we have to wait and see. There has been two other aircraft gone down in that region of the Indian Ocean over the years," he told ABC News Breakfast. "The one that comes to mind is the South African Airways that went off Mauritius in 1987."To confirm it, we will have to find the identification plate, and that will be able to be determined by Airbus whether it's one of their components."It looks like a flap system off a very large aircraft and knowing the current system off the Indian Ocean ... so the possibilities are very high that it could be off MH370."Australian Transport Safety Bureau spokesman Joe Hatley said the component "looks in reasonably good shape"."We really need to look into the detail of the size, the shape and if there are any identifying marks on it, such as part numbers or serial numbers," he told News Breakfast. No trace has been found of the Boeing 777, which disappeared in March last year carrying 239 passengers and crew from Kuala Lumpur, bound for Beijing, in what has become one of the greatest mysteries in aviation history.Most of the passengers were Chinese. There were also six Australians onboard.Search efforts led by Australia have focused on a broad expanse of the southern Indian Ocean.Xavier Tytelman, an expert in aviation security, said it could not be ruled out that the wreckage belonged to MH370. No part of the wreckage has ever been found and Malaysian authorities in January declared that all on board were presumed dead.Mr Tytelman said that local media photos showed "incredible similarities between a #B777 flaperon and the debris found", referring to a Boeing 777 — the type of plane that disappeared.He also noted a reference on the wreckage: BB670."This code is not a plane's registration number, nor serial number," Mr Tytelman said."However... it's clear that this reference would allow a quick identification. In a few days, we will have a definitive answer."Boeing said in a statement it remained "committed to supporting the MH370 investigation and the search for the airplane"."We continue to share our technical expertise and analysis," the US aviation giant said. "Our goal, along with the entire global aviation industry, continues to be not only to find the airplane, but also to determine what happened — and why."An ocean currents expert says computer modelling predicted wreckage would wash up near Madagascar, and if this debris was from MH370, more would likely arrive in the coming week.Professor Charitha Pattiaratchi, from University of Western Australia Oceans Institute, said he expected more wreckage to be found."In fact our computer models predicted one year ago, that ... 18 to 24 months after the crash, this would be one of the regions where debris would wash up," he said."We can say that it could have only have originated south of the equator to the east of the area that it came from. "If this did originate from the MH370 it's most likely that more debris will be washing up in that region in the next coming week."It is exciting, it also ... gives us hope and confidence that we are looking at the right place where it crashed."He said it could also put to bed some of the conspiracy theories that MH370 did not crash.ABC/wires
