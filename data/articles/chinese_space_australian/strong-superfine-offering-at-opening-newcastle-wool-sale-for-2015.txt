Hunter Valley wool producers will be closely watching the opening super fine sale of the year with the current value of the Australian dollar expected to improve prices.Chinese and European buyers out fill their end of season orders will lead the buying at the designated Newcastle sale held in Sydney.The Australian wool market has had a positive start to 2015 due to the decline in the currency and better quality clips being offered by growers.Craig Brennan from Elders said an easing of drought conditions is some areas will help the super fine fleece producers. "The wools we've got offering in the first super fine offering of this year are pretty reasonable quality actually," he said. "A lot of wools are still testing pretty good newtons, in the sort of 40 newtons-plus. "Nearly all the wools are low for vegetable fault, a lot of wools testing under one per cent VM (vegetable matter), so that's positive. "They're pretty bright and high yielding so we're expecting the market to continue to improve."Summer rainfall across much of the state in recent months has already started to see the quality of clips improve. Mr Brennan said the current value of the dollar against the U-S currency is also helping producers."If this dollar stays under the 79 cent level, we will see more activity from China. "They have to purchase wool over the next few weeks before their break in late February-March, so that will be one thing."Also the Europeans will generally have a bit of a rally now into February-March for their mills as they finish their super fine orders."
