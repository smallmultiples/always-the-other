The financer behind a local challenge to a Chinese takeover of Tasmanian dairy giant Van Diemen's Land Company (VDL) has rejected claims her bid for the company may damage Tasmania's reputation overseas. The current owners of VDL have accepted a $280 million bid from Chinese company Moon Lake investments, owned by businessman Lu Xianfeng.But the offer sparked a local-driven campaign called Save the Farm spearheaded by well-known businesswoman Jan Cameron.In turn, news of the challenge was picked up by Chinese media and Tasmania's Premier Will Hodgman now fears the challenge could affect future foreign investment in Tasmania.The Tasmanian Chinese Business Association and the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry have also raised concerns."What's very real is the threat to our reputation," Mr Hodgman said."Since the visit by President Xi [in November 2014] and a concerted effort by state and federal governments to open relations with extraordinary trade deals that are going to mean immense benefits for our state and our country, it does send a very mixed message."Particularly [that] high-profile Australians are sending a message that Chinese investment is not welcome here."And that means more money for our state, more investment, jobs, economic wealth, not welcomed."In its 190-year history, VDL has never been Australian owned.Ms Cameron said she had done business with China for 35 years, and she did not intend to cause a furore. She said she had managed to raise the funds for an offer equivalent to Moon Lake's, through a consortium she intended to keep anonymous, for now.  "Australia should have food security over other countries," she said."I don't see why that should be seen as racist or xenophobic."They're under a lot of pressure to secure their food. Everyone understands this, we all understand it."But do we want to be selling our largest dairy farm to the Chinese, now?"Ms Cameron said she backed foreign investment in real estate, but not when it was linked to agricultural land.She said a visit to Canberra last week had "demonstrated that neither Labor nor Liberal politicians want to save this farm for Australian ownership".Jason Xu from the Tasmanian Chinese Business Association said the challenge and its coverage was not a good look overseas. "We have an opportunity to let more Australian people understand Chinese culture and Chinese investment," he said. "This is a lack of communication or a misunderstanding."Many people are making comments about why Tasmanian, or Australian people, are refusing Chinese investment."Mr Xu said Moon Lake owner Lu Xianfeng had a good track record of investing favourably in Australia, and he hoped support for Ms Cameron's challenge did not suggest an underlying racism."If it's because we're Chinese, it would be very disappointing," he said. Sally Chandler, a trade specialist at the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, agreed."I'm hearing reports of racism, as such," she said."Some of it has been brought about by our own local media publishing information, and in turn, the media in China has picked that up and put their own interpretation on it."The Chinese do believe everything they read."They don't question it. They believe it. And that is a very big concern of mine, that it won't be questioned."
