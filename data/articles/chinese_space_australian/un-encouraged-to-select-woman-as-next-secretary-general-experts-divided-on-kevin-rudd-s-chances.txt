The United Nations has formally begun its search for the next UN Secretary General.The current UN Chief Ban Ki-moon is due to step down at the end of next year.There are reports Kevin Rudd has been lobbying for the position, but US Ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, has encouraged member countries to consider putting forward a woman for the top job.For 70 years the position has been held by men.Ambassador Power made the appeal in a letter sent to member states asking them to start putting forward candidates.A list of candidates should be completed by March.The 15 member countries will usually consider the short list behind closed doors and recommend a candidate to be elected by the General Assembly.Dr Alexey Muraviev, the head of Department of Social Sciences and International Studies at Curtain University, said there were important skills required for the position."You need to be quite experienced in the business of international politics," he said."You would have a degree of prominence, you should be known to be international community and in different capacities."I would be stunned if (Kevin Rudd) even got on to some sort of shortlist. Dr Muraviev said the Secretary General must be able to handle the art of compromise, as well as being able to push the United Nations' agenda."Given the current level of tensions in international relations and growing disagreements that you see inside the United Nations and within the United Nations framework, you really need to have guts to drive the United Nations forward because of the growing scepticism of the capacity of the organisation to fulfil its role."Kevin Rudd is reportedly pushing for the Secretary General position and Dr Muraviev said he may be in with a chance."He may actually end up being one of those who may be shortlisted, despite the fact that, say from Chinese or Russian perspective, an Australian candidate would be perceived to be closely affiliated with the United States, with the United Kingdom, to some extent with France."But he may be actually considered to be a figure that may be suitable or welcomed by all major parties."Dr Anthony Billingsley, a lecturer in international studies at the University of New South Wales, strongly disagrees."I would be stunned if (Kevin Rudd) even got on to some sort of shortlist," he said."I just don't think that he has done enough internationally, plus he has, with some determination, offended the Chinese to a point and I think that that would be probably enough to make it very clear that he's not welcome."Dr Billingsley said it would be fantastic if a woman took the job."Women should be represented at all levels, and I suppose that's all there is to it," he said."But I think on balance it would be really good to have a woman in that position.
