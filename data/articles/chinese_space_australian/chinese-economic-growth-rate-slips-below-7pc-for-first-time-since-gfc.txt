China's economic growth rate has slipped below the official target of 7 per cent for the first time since the GFC.China's GDP grew at 1.8 per cent in the September quarter taking the annualised rate to 6.9 per cent.While it beat market expectations of 6.8 per cent growth, it is still the slowest rate of economic growth China has reported since the September quarter in 2009 at the height of the GFC.The better than expected result was supported by the so-called "tertiary industries" or the services sector accelerating again and growing by 8.6 per cent.That largely offset on-going weakness in "secondary industries" — such as manufacturing and construction — which grew at a disappointing 5.8 per cent, down from 6.1 per cent growth in the previous quarter.Despite solid exports in September, the overall external demand performance over the quarter was weak, falling 5.4 per cent in the quarter and contracting further from the 2.9 per cent drop in the July quarter.In nominal terms — that is not adjusted for inflation — GDP expanded at 6.2 per cent, down from 7.1 per cent in the previous quarter.Westpac Global Economics team said the "nominal" figure was a more reliable gauge of underlying demand conditions than the "real" inflation-adjusted estimate and pointed to a much starker deceleration."The overall picture remains distinctly underwhelming and far from constructive for the commodity complex," Westpac said. Other monthly indicators of domestic activity released at the same time as the GDP numbers pointed to on-going weakness.Industrial production data for September fell to 5.7 per cent growth year on year, down from 6 per cent in August, the slowest rate of growth in 25 years.Monthly fixed asset investment figures showed a rise 10.3 per cent in the year-to-date, well below the Government's target of 15 per cent growth and the slowest rate of investment since 2000.The bright spot in monthly figures was a stronger retail sector where sales in September were up 10.9 per cent, ahead of a consensus estimate of 10.8 per cent.Regional markets had mixed reactions to the news with the Shanghai Composite edging up, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng and Japan's Nikkei lost ground.The ASX 200 also lost momentum in afternoon trade, however the Australian dollar firmed marginally.
