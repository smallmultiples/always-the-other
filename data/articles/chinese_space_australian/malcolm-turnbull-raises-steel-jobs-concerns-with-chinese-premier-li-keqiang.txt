Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull says China's Premier has assured him Beijing is moving to cut excess steel production, after raising the impact on Australian jobs during high-level talks.The recent hardships at South Australian steelmaker Arrium prompted Mr Turnbull to press Li Keqiang on China's dumping of cheap steel on the global market."[Premier Li] is seeking to reduce China's steel production by about 150 million tonnes per year", Mr Turnbull said."It was in that context that I raised the importance of ensuring that overcapacity around the world was settled, because the issue of excess supply obviously has implications for other countries, as we have seen at Whyalla."The issue has been the main point of economic friction on a visit that has heavily focused on deepening Australia-China trade links.Mr Turnbull cast aside concerns about the slowing Chinese economy and pledged that agricultural exports and tourism would continue to fuel Australia's prosperity.In Shanghai, he addressed more than 1,000 Australian business delegates and will be meeting Australian and Chinese CEOs in Beijing.Mr Turnbull also oversaw a $10 million deal between the CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences for joint research projects, which he said showed the relationship "goes well beyond trade". Despite the economic focus, the thorny issue of China's expanding military presence in the South China Sea has at times threatened to overshadow the visit.Mr Turnbull confirmed he had "very frank discussions' with Premier Li on the issue and urged a peaceful resolution of territorial disputes with the five other nations that make overlapping claims."China understands our position, they understand our commitment to a peaceful and stable region," he said.The issue is likely to come up again in a private dinner between China's top-ranked leader President Xi Jinping and Mr Turnbull at the traditional Diaoyutai guesthouse in Beijing's west on Friday evening. Chinese state media editorials have in recent days urged Australia not to continually raise the South China Sea disputes, and have warned that it could potentially affect the economic relationship."As far is China is concerned, if you raise issues you have that's fine, but if you try to play with this issue in public to gain some political advantage, that's probably not acceptable," said Professor Jia Qingguo from Peking University in Beijing.Recent international concerns about a tightening of the ruling Communist Party's control over the country's courts may also come up in the meeting with President Xi, with Mr Turnbull confirming he had raised human rights concerns in his meeting with Mr Li, although he did not specify which issues.
