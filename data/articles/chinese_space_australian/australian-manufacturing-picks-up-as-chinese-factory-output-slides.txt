There has been a recovery in Australia's manufacturing sector in July, with sales growing for the first time in more than a year.The Performance of Manufacturing Index (PMI) by the Australian Industry Group rose by 6.2 points to 50.4 last month.That is just above the key 50-point level, which separates expansion from contraction.The Australian Industry Group's head of policy, Peter Burn, said manufacturing sales in particular, enjoyed a big recovery last month."That indicates a pick up in domestic sales that we hadn't previously had," he explained."So the lower dollar is clearly helping and, if it persists at this level or even falls a bit further as many are expecting, then that will also help domestic producers."Mr Burn said it will probably take a few more months of a lower Australian dollar to convince many firms that it is safe to invest in expansion again."We do need significant investment in manufacturing, as in other parts of the economy," he said."If the level of confidence can slowly accumulate, and manufacturers are convinced then of a lower dollar and more profitable conditions, and then they can start to invest, that's what we really need."However, while Australian manufacturers are benefitting from a lower dollar, which is partly a result of the Chinese economic slowdown, local resources companies will be bracing for even lower demand as a key China manufacturing index fell to a two-year low.The final Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell even more than a preliminary reading - out last week - suggested, sliding from 49.4 in June to 47.8 in July.That is well below the 50-point level separating expansion from contraction.The figure also included a fall in new orders and a steep slide in factory output to a three-and-a-half-year low.
