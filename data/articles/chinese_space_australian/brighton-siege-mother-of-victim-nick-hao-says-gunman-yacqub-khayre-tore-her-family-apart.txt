The mother of a man killed by a gunman during the Melbourne apartment building siege on Monday says she "hates the terrorist who tore her family apart".Nick Hao, 36, was working at Buckingham Serviced Apartments on Monday night when he was shot dead by Yacqub Khayre.Khayre took a woman hostage and was shot dead by police after firing at officers and injuring three of them.Mr Hao was born in China and became an Australian citizen after emigrating in 2002. He got married only weeks ago.Speaking through a translator, Mr Hao's mother, who did not want to be named, said she had not eaten or slept for two days. "We are both old and now we have to bury our son. It feels like the end of the world," she said."I can't tell you how sad I feel, and I can't tell you how much hatred I feel towards terrorist who did this to my son."I hate the terrorist who tore my family apart."My son is an Australian citizen and he has worked very hard in Australia and built a life for himself and has made a contribution to Australian society, and now I send him off to work one day and he never came back."Khayre had a history of violence and was acquitted over a plot to attack a Sydney army base in 2009. He was on parole at the time of the attack for non-terror related crimes.Mr Hao's mother said Khayre should not have been living in the community given his violent past, and if he did not hurt her son he would have hurt somebody else.Mr Hao was married in Australia only a month ago."We were planning to host a wedding banquet at the end of August in China but now I have to go back with his remains instead," his mother said. Mr Hao's mother said she and her husband had moved to Australia about a year ago because their son wanted to look after and provide for them."When we came to Australia, we were looking forward to a family reunion but after the incident, the past few days have been the saddest and darkest days in our lives," she said."We spent most of our savings on our son sending him to Australia and now we have lost all our hope and have no-one to rely on."She thanked the Victorian Government, Victoria Police and local Chinese community for their support."We don't know much in Australia, and we don't speak English and we are truly helpless here," she said."Such an incident happening in Melbourne truly shows that the world is full of uncertainties and dangers."We hope Australians [and] Australian Chinese communities can all unite together and watch out for each other and together we can fight terrorism."
