One highly damaging media quote is at the heart of the Government's attack on Labor Senator Sam Dastyari.It was first reported on the front page of respected national newspaper, the Financial Review, last week.It's this line, taken from a Chinese language report on a media event on June 16 during the federal election campaign:"The South China Sea is China's own affair, Australia should remain neutral and respect China on this matter".The quote puts Senator Dastyari at odds with the Government and Labor policy on China and the South China Sea.It comes from a media article published on the website www.qldtoday.com, and the Government maintains that it forms the basis of an argument for the senator to be sacked from the frontbench.The Prime Minister and senior cabinet ministers say Senator Dastyari has questions to answer about "cash for comment", because of his Chinese and China-linked donors.Senator Dastyari has provided a short written statement, and has said no more publicly. He has not conducted any interviews."I'm not responsible for how the Chinese Media report my comments. I support the position of the Labor Party on the South China Sea and all other foreign policy matters," the statement said.Senator Dastyari has told the ABC he has no recording of what was said at the media event, and so far attempts to track down a written, audio or visual file have met a dead end.When Labor frontbench colleague Stephen Conroy was questioned further about this on the AM program, he said he'd been in close contact with Senator Dastyari.When asked repeatedly whether Senator Dastyari denied making the specific statement on China, Senator Conroy did not provide a direct response.Last week, Senator Dastyari's comments were raised in Parliament by the nation's highest lawmaker, Attorney-General George Brandis.Senator Brandis questioned whether the Labor frontbencher had been compromised.He laid out his reasoning in Parliament: The Attorney-General has said: "Senator Dastyari's acceptance of personal benefits from an entity or entities with links to the Chinese state and the carefully opaque way in which the payments have been described in the Register of Senators' Interests raise the inevitable question of whether Senator Dastyari, whether advertently or unwittingly, has allowed himself to be compromised". According to Google's simple translation tool, the article containing the pro-China quote from Senator Dastyari is attributed to Xinhua, the Chinese national press agency, but Xinhua says that's not correct and it did not attend the media conference.The www.qldtoday.com website is owned by Media Group Australia. The ABC contacted the registered name with the site and spoke to Dapeng Zhang, who said he was CEO.According to Mr Zhang's LinkedIn profile, Media Group Australia was established in 2010 and is promoted as Australia's number one Chinese social media site."Great efforts have been made to provide Australia Chinese with the most comprehensive and authentic news from Australia, enabling Australian Chinese and new immigrations to better understand and integrate into the country," information provided on the site reads.Further attempts to contact people affiliated with Media Group Australia have so far been fruitless.There are still a range of unknowns about the media event that is central to the Government's case against Senator Dastyari.The senator's office kept no recording of a media event that was held during the election campaign.A number of other Labor candidates were present, but no recording or transcript of the event has materialised.We don't know which media outlets attended the event. A number of further questions have been put to the senator's office.
