Prime Minister Tony Abbott says Labor should listen to former prime minister Bob Hawke's views on the Chinese free trade deal.Late yesterday, Labor backbencher Kelvin Thomson flagged opposing the deal unless changes were made.Mr Thomson is the deputy chairman of Parliament's Treaties Committee.He is concerned about the lack of safeguards in the deal for workers and Australian jobs."I don't believe it should be supported as it stands," Mr Thomson said.But Mr Hawke, who has close ties to China, is quoted in The Australian newspaper as saying opposing the deal would be "against Australia's best interests".Mr Abbott seized on Mr Hawke's comments."I say to Bill Shorten, listen to decent Labor people like Bob Hawke and Bob Carr, stop dancing to the tune of the CFMEU," Mr Abbott said.Later Opposition Leader Bill Shorten defended Labor's bid to negotiate and make changes to the agreement."It takes two to negotiate and if Mr Abbott and Mr Robb simply say well the Parliament just has to agree with everything they say well the Parliament wouldn't be doing its job," he said."If they could climb off their high horse and not [bring] their standard arrogant as usual approach to negotiations with the Opposition, we can get a win-win deal for Australians, but at the moment I can't in good conscience agree that there aren't problems with this agreement."Earlier the parliamentary secretary for trade, Steve Ciobo, accused Mr Thomson of being "anti-economic growth" and working against the national interest."If his view takes hold, if the Labor Party continues with its opposition to the free trade agreement with China, it just underscores this is a Labor Opposition more focused on politics than it is in the national interest," Mr Ciobo told AM. Mr Thomson is taking a harder line on the free trade deal to Labor's trade spokeswoman, Penny Wong, who said yesterday: "We are up for a trade agreement with China.""We are willing to find a way through to address the safeguards issues — the issues we have concerns about and the community has concerns about," Senator Wong told Sky News.Labor frontbencher Doug Cameron said he shared Mr Thomson's scepticism about the benefits of past trade deals but that he backed Senator Wong's focus on sitting down with the Government."It's a bad agreement as it stands and it should be changed," Senator Cameron said.However, he did not rule out Labor opposing it."Labor has to consider all the options. If the Government is determined that it will turn us into nothing more than a quarry, a farm and a tourist destination that's a debate that has to take place in the caucus."The two parties have been locked in an ideological brawl over the agreement with Trade Minister Andrew Robb warning any move to obstruct or oppose it would amount to "economic sabotage". "I think there are enough people within the Opposition who will prevail, and that's my hope. Certainly the Government will push with all my strength to ensure that the message gets through," Mr Robb told the ABC's 7.30 program.Mr Robb wants the relevant legislation passed by December to allow the deal to take effect from January.Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) chief executive Kate Carnell said it would be "catastrophic" if Labor blocked the agreement.The ACCI is joining with the Minerals Council and National Farmers Federation to launch an advertising campaign next week to counter the construction union's ads which claim the China deal will disadvantage Australian jobs."Unfortunately we think the [Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union] ads are biting. They're concerning Australians that somehow this agreement is going to mean ... cheap Chinese labour will come to take Australian jobs. That's simply not the case," Ms Carnell said."The Chinese free trade agreement is going to create significant jobs for Australia — in the farming sector, in the manufacturing sector, in the services sector."
