Around half of the potential bidders showing an interest in buying Australia's biggest private land holder, S Kidman & Co, are from overseas, the historic pastoral company's managing director says.An information memorandum will be released to prospective buyers who have signed a confidentiality agreement in the coming days after the 116-year-old company announced it was up for sale in April."There's a list of several dozen [so far] who are keen to get hold of that information," managing director Greg Campbell said."At least half of those people are Australian based ... a spread of funds, syndicates of investors, wealthy individuals, established agricultural entities."There's around half that's offshore."There's a significant proportion from China, but surprisingly there's also strong interest out of America and Switzerland." S Kidman & Co was founded by Australia's so-called cattle king Sir Sidney Kidman, who was the largest pastoral land holder in the world when he died in 1935.His descendants still own the majority of the Adelaide-based company.But Mr Campbell said many have other business interests and want to use cash from the sale for those investments. He conceded not everyone wants to sell."I think it's fair to say if you put 50 or 60 members of any family together and asked for their opinion on some major decision that's in front of a family they're not all going to agree," he said."But the board of directors received signed notices from 98 per cent of the shareholders saying we want to sell the company."Now people can beat up feuds in the family and other sorts of things if they want to, but straight mathematics says 98 per cent wanting to sell is not necessarily a feud in the family."S Kidman & Co owns 17 pastoral leases and two freehold grazing operations mainly in central Australia.The company's land holdings cover more than 120,120 square kilometres across South Australia, Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory.As well as the total land area, which is 1.6 per cent of the Australian continent and bigger than many European nations, the company has around 160,000 head of cattle.Company records show the net assets were valued at just on $300 million at the end of March, but Mr Campbell said with soaring cattle prices that was a conservative sales figure."I think you'd find in the current market that the net asset value of the company is the very minimum price," he said.Don't be fooled by desert. Desert can be an attractive place to do business. "We could almost revalue the Kidman herd weekly and come up with a higher number."Some in the industry have questioned the timing of the sale with land values still depressed.But Mr Campbell said international factors, including a falling Australian dollar, free trade agreements and rising demand for Australian beef in Asia and the US, favour a sale.However he acknowledged some of the company's prized properties in the channel country were not at their best, after a run of poor seasons."By and large northern South Australia ... is good and the channel country is where the seasonal problems lie and we're on much reduced herds there," he said."The outlook's not good for the next summer, a lot of warnings about El Nino."We're in a safe situation through until the hot weather arrives and we'll just review and respond at that point." One of the company's properties that is in better shape is Anna Creek in northern South Australia — the biggest cattle station in the world at 23,000 square kilometres.While it may attract a lot of attention because of its size, in grazing circles the arid property is not considered one of the company's jewels.But Mr Campbell said its rates of return were some of the highest in the Kidman portfolio."A lot of people think the Kidmans — they've been around for a hundred years poor buggers and they still own all that desert ... surely they ought to have been able to buy a bit of better country by now," he said."But smart managers can make better rates of returns out of cheap country if they run it well than people who put money into high value country and don't run it well."Don't be fooled by desert. Desert can be an attractive place to do business."While Mr Campbell said a public listing on the stock exchange has not been ruled out, company directors are aiming to sell the business in its entirety as a trade sale.A short-list of potential buyers will be selected in the coming months with final offers to be lodged by late August and the company expected to sell before the end of the year.
