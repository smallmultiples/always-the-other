Wrapping 8,000 oranges is no quick task, but for those at Mingyue Lay Buddhist Temple in Bonnyrigg in western Sydney, it is an important one to welcome in the new lunar year.Volunteers are busy preparing to greet worshippers over the weekend as they say goodbye to the Year of the Sheep, and welcome in the Year of the Monkey on Monday."We're packing all the oranges and lucky money for the people who will attend our temple at new year's time," volunteer Nancy Wong said."Everyone will get one pack of fook doi, which means 'lucky bag', for them to bring home and bring them wishes for the whole family to be healthy and wealthy." Offering oranges or other fruits is a common practice in Buddhism as a way to connect with the spiritual world and "feed" the ancestors.According to James Chan, chairman of the Australian-Chinese Buddhist Association, at least 5,000 worshippers will visit the Bonnyrigg temple on Sunday and Monday to place incense, pay their respects to the gods and pray for a year of good luck and safety."They want to make wishes for good business, to have children, they want a partner or girlfriend or something so they make a wish to the god â€” that's why they all want to come in the new year, to make their first wish," Mr Chan said."The monkey is very active and very intelligent, so I think it will be a good year."We hope everyone will have a healthy and active life like the monkey, and they're very slim and fit." In the lead-up to Chinese New Year's Day, families traditionally buy new clothes, hang lanterns and lucky symbols and clean their houses to rid the home of any bad spirits.They will also gather together on new year's eve for a big meal, which for 18-year-old Carmen Tsen, is the most enjoyable part of the celebrations."At Chinese New Year, your whole family comes together to have dinner and some family, which you haven't seen for years, come back and have a dinner together," Ms Tsen said."We have fun, watch the lion dancers and it's very happy and cheerful and a very happy environment."Ms Tsen will also perform as one of the lions in Sunday evening's festivities and the temple's master, Ming Shang Shi, will also give a blessing to all attendees.Translating for the Buddhist monk, Mr Chan said Master Shi "tries to look after everyone, and makes sure they have a happy and healthy family and good business."
