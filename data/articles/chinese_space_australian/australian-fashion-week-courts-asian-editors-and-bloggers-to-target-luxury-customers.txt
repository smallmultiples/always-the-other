The Chinese community is the new target market for the fashion industry, with organisers of Australian Fashion Week focused this year on tapping into the local Asian market.Several fashion bloggers and "digital influencers" have been invited from China, Singapore and the Philippines to attend dozens of runway shows throughout the week.Grazia Australia has also flown in two editors from its partner agency in China and hired Sydney-based Chinese writers and presenters to report on fashion, travel and lifestyle news in Mandarin via Weibo and WeChat social media channels.Grazia's China markets director Adam Huang said his team was focused on reporting fashion and lifestyle news in a "Chinese way to explain what is happening in Sydney". "Most Chinese people here love [fashion] especially here in Sydney," he said. "But the problem is they're kind of a bit isolated from the market, from the mainstream media because there's not that many Chinese media here in Australia doing fashion or lifestyle properly. "Usually they talk about good restaurants to go to or simple fashion news directly translated from English articles."Mr Huang, who lives in Shanghai, said luxury brands were missing the opportunity to attract Chinese consumers locally because "they don't have the staff" who speak the language to communicate news and events."What we want to do is build a bridge between fashion brands in Australia and the local market in Australia by using bilingual staff who have the expertise of editors in fashion and lifestyle," he said.Despite Chinese tourists being some of the biggest spenders on Australian products and services, Mr Huang said Australian fashion in China was still a "niche market" and building its reputation had "a long way to go".He said Chinese people were more interested in the travel and lifestyle aspects of Australia.In South-East Asia though, Australian fashion is booming according to Singaporean blogger Nicole Wong."Back in Singapore, Australia fashion is widely well received because of the weather and climate, the type of materials used and the designer cut," she said."It's very work appropriate as well but still sexy at the same time — still very classy."Ms Wong is one of several digital influencers from Asia invited to attend Australian Fashion Week this year. Her website has a circulation of 1.3 million people while her Instagram account @ncwong, boasts more than 52,000 followers.It is an incredible achievement for the stylist who never studied fashion and started a blog in her teens to simply document her life.The increasing interest in Australian brands from her followers prompted her visit to Sydney."Everything is so fresh — I personally like clean designs and I think for most Asians we don't like the big fuss; we like clean cuts, minimal designs that are timeless and classic," she said."I can relate more to Australian designers because it's much more wearable."
