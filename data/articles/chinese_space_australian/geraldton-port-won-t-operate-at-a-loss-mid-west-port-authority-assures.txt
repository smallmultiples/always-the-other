The doubtful financial situation of its biggest customer will not place the Geraldton Port at risk, the chief executive of the Mid West Port Authority says.In documents lodged with the Australian Securities and Investment Commission this week, Karara Mining Limited (KML) reported an after-tax loss of more than $1.6 billion last year.While the lion's share of the write off was an impairment expense of $1.2 billion, Karara's operating costs exceeded $300 million.The documents also revealed the project has up to $830 million of short-term loans due over the course of 2017.The junior miner, a joint venture between Chinese majority shareholder Ansteel and Australian-listed Gindalbie Metals, had undertaken a cost reduction strategy to slash up to $200 million from its operating costs.While relatively successful, in notes to the financial statements Karara's directors anticipated ongoing operating losses for at least the next two years."If the funding needed is not raised or the repayment or delivery dates not extended, there exists a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on KML's ability to continue," the report said.Mid West Port Authority chief executive Peter Klein said he was confident Karara would continue in the medium term, but acknowledged any closure would represent a significant challenge to the state-owned port.In the 2014-15 financial year, more than 13 million tonnes of iron ore was exported from the Geraldton Port.According to the financial statement, Karara exported 8.8 million tonnes of ore last year — 6.2 million tonnes of magnetite and 2.6 million tonnes of hematite.Mr Klein said iron ore accounted for up to 75 per cent of the port's total trade, with Karara alone representing 50 per cent of its total trade.In May, the State Government granted Karara a port concession of $0.72 per tonne in 2016–17 and $0.66 per tonne in 2017–18.At the current export price, a tonnage of 8.8 million tonnes would represent a revenue stream of almost $6.5 million."Our forecast profit is only about that amount," Mr Klein said."So going forward, if we were to lose it, it would create some very substantial challenges for us."The port collected $19.5 million last year, but according to its Statement of Corporate Intent it anticipates a profit of just $3.6 million this year.Mr Klein said the statement had been issued almost 12 months ago, and the port had since readjusted its projected profit.He remained adamant that the Port would never operate at a loss."We've certainly looked at what the implications are to the business of losing Karara," he said."We've certainly got plans to reduce our overall cost of operation to ensure that we are always in a position where we are meeting our financial expectations."We won't operate at a loss, that's the bottom line.""Like any business, it's just not sustainable."So we'll trim our cloth to the extent necessary to ensure we're not in that position."
