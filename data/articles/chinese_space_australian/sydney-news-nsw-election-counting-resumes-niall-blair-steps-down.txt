Despite a return to power, Primary Industries and Regional Water Minister Niall Blair said he needs to resign from Cabinet due to the personal costs of politics."I cannot deny that the level of aggression directed towards me around water policy has had a profound impact," he said.In the face of ongoing drought, regional communities need a representative who can fight with them "every waking minute", he said.Mr Blair said he will remain a member of the Legislative Council until a replacement is found.Speaking to ABC Radio Sydney this morning, Mr Blair defended the timing of his announcement, saying he did not want to be a distraction. "If I pulled out two months ago and said I wasn't going to stand, the media would be saying instability, running from the post, running away from water issues."The president of the Chinese Community Council of Australia said Labor leader Michael Daley's remarks about 'Asians with PhDs' were hurtful to the community.In a video released a week before the election, Mr Daley was seen telling a Labor function last year that young people were leaving Sydney because Asian migrants were taking their jobs.Tony Pun said he has spoken to a lot of community members and the Chinese-Australians in two Sydney seats "reacted badly" to those remarks."The voting patterns in Kogarah and Oatley — they have similar demographics with large numbers of Chinese Australians and there are swings of about 3.9 per cent to 4 per cent consistently in both these electorates," he said."Mass social media was used in the Chinese Australian community ... do not underestimate the apps the community uses — news spreads like wildfires." A coroner will start hearing evidence today about the disappearance of toddler William Tyrrell who was last seen wearing a Spider-Man costume on the NSW mid-north coast.This week the inquest is expected to focus on William's family background, when exactly he disappeared and what action was taken immediately afterwards.Deputy State Coroner Harriet Grahame, who observed a large-scale police search for the three-year-old, will preside over the inquest.William went missing from his foster grandmother's front yard in Kendall in 2014. Police have made the unusual discovery of a crocodile while searching a Sydney property connected to a former Finks outlaw motorcycle gang member.The residents of the Colebee home did not hold a wildlife exhibitors licence, forcing police to seize the freshwater crocodile.The former Finks member has been charged over the alleged possession of the croc, as well as possession of stolen property including a Mercedes Benz sedan and a jet ski.He has been granted strict conditional bail. Opponents of a controversial $800 million mine on the NSW Central Coast say they are not giving up the fight, despite losing an appeal over its approval.The Land and Environment Court dismissed a challenge by the Australian Coal Alliance, which argued the Wallarah mine near Wyong could potentially impact the region's drinking water catchment.The Alliance's Alan Hayes said the latest court decision will be appealed."As they say, it's not over until the fat lady sings and she hasn't even started to warm up tonsils up yet".
