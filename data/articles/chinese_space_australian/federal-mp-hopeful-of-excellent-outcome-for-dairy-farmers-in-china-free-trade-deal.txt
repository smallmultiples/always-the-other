A Federal Government backbencher has given one of the strongest indications yet Australian dairy will be a winner when a free trade deal is signed with China.The Federal Government expects the agreement to be signed in Australia next week, when the Chinese president Xi Jinping is in the country.The dairy industry hopes the deal is better than New Zealand's 2008 agreement with China, which has seen Kiwi exports soar.Dan Tehan is the Liberal Member for Wannon in the key dairy region of south-west Victoria and he expects the deal will deliver for dairy farmers."I'm very hopeful if there is a deal, which is announced on Monday, that it'll be an excellent outcome for our dairy farmers," Mr Tehan said."I'm confident we're going to get a very good outcome for our dairy farmers."[A deal is] obviously very close, the Trade Minister Andrew Robb has been in China recently, as has the Prime Minister [Tony Abbott]," he said.A delegation of dairy industry representatives worked with trade negotiators in China last week.The ABC understands the group returned "quite positive", despite a few sticking points remaining before the deal is completed."The dairy industry on behalf of dairy farmers have done a terrific job advocating on behalf of the industry. They've made it very clear what they're looking for in this deal," Mr Tehan said."I think the Chinese understand they want the clean, green product that our dairy producers produce so regularly and I think they're looking for our milk."Chinese tariffs on Australian dairy are about 10 to 15 per cent.New analysis from the United Dairyfarmers of Victoria (UDV) found the industry could save more than $630 million in tariff duties over a decade, depending on details of the agreement."Based on a number of assumptions and analysis the expectation is it could be worth something in the order of $630 million over the next decade," UDV president Tyran Jones said."In the context of industry investment it's a meaningful figure."Mr Jones said he was quietly confident of a good deal for the sector.
