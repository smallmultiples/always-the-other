The Australian share market has recovered from early falls, as China's main share markets bounced back from steep opening losses during the session.Major share markets across Europe and the US fell overnight after the Shanghai composite index fell dramatically in its last hour of trade yesterday to close 8.6 per cent lower, with most of the losses posted after the Australian share market had closed.Within 20 minutes of its 10:00am (AEST) open, the Australian share market's major indices were off 0.6 per cent, with most companies and sectors in the red, and falls eventually peaking around the 1 per cent level.Even falls of as much as 5 per cent for China's premier Shanghai share market during the morning failed to drag Australia's benchmark indices much lower.By its mid-session break, the Shanghai market was just 1 per cent down, having even broken into positive territory briefly.With Chinese shares on their lunch break, the Australian share market stabilised to be all but flat, with the ASX 200 up 0.1 per cent at 5,594 and the All Ordinaries up 1 point at 5,581 around 2:30pm (AEST).Unsurprisingly, the major miners for whom China is their biggest customer for iron ore, coal and copper were hit the hardest in the morning before bouncing back.BHP Billiton dipped more than 2 per cent, below the $25 mark, at various points in early trade before bouncing back to be up 0.1 per cent at $25.54; Rio Tinto was 0.7 per cent higher.Iron ore specialist Fortescue was 2.2 per cent higher at $1.75, after having been 2.2 per cent lower at $1.67 earlier in the session, while BHP spin-off South32 was 0.6 per cent down at $1.75.Oil and gas producer Woodside also recovered to be up 1.2 per cent.Westpac was down 0.5 per cent after the Financial Review revealed that it is potentially losing millions of dollars in revenue due to an IT system that has not allowed it to raise investor home loan interest rates without also lifting owner-occupier rates.However, the other major banks recovered from early losses to be up between 0.2 and 0.5 per cent.NAB also announced the sale of the rest of its stake in Great Western Bancorp in the US, which it said could fetch as much as $US385 million ($528 million).Retailers were mixed: Woolworths was off 0.3 per cent and Wesfarmers up 0.4 per cent; Harvey Norman was down 1.1 per cent and JB Hi-Fi 2.7 per cent, while Myer was up 3 per cent to $1.22.Qantas was down 0.4 per cent, despite another fall in oil prices overnight.China's turbulence weighed on the Australian dollar in the morning, but it has since bounced back to 73.05 US cents.
