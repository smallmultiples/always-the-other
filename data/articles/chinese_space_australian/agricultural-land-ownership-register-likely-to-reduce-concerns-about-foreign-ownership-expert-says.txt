A senior economics lecturer in Perth says it is likely Australia's first register of foreign-owned agricultural land will allay concerns about an imagined takeover by overseas companies.Foreign individuals, companies, and trustees of Australian agricultural land have less than a week to register their holdings with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).The Agricultural Land Register would collect information from those who have an existing or new interest in agricultural land.It would also gather information from parties who no longer had interest in agricultural land.The register was designed to paint a clearer picture of international investment levels across the sector.Murdoch University senior lecturer in economics Dr Anne Garnett said most of Australia's land was locally owned, and the register should calm concerns about a foreign buy-up of local farms."Transparency's always good," she said."I think it will reduce concerns about foreign ownership because once people actually have full information I think they'll have a better understanding about foreign ownership."They won't get quite so concerned about things that they might hear just in passing about some sort of imagined takeover of all our land."Federal Treasurer Scott Morrison said the ATO was collecting the information as part of the "Government's commitment to increasing scrutiny and transparency around foreign investment in Australian agriculture".Dr Garnett said many people may be surprised to learn how little of Australia's agricultural land was owned by overseas companies."Australia-wide you've got 88 per cent of the agricultural land is wholly Australian owned and then another 5 per cent is partially owned by Australians," she said."In WA, 93 per cent of agricultural land is wholly Australian owned."The figures are based on data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which conducted two surveys on foreign ownership; one in 2010 and another in 2013.Dr Garnett said it was likely the register would provide a more comprehensive picture of foreign ownership than survey data.It is understood the register would be a publicly available resource.Dr Garnett said the United States and United Kingdom were traditionally the biggest investors in Australian agricultural land, despite many believing China was the main holder."China is perhaps the newest interest in WA land," she said."So I guess being the new kids on the block they're receiving a bit more coverage."There are penalties for not declaring foreign land holdings.All existing foreign-owned agricultural land holdings, regardless of their value, need to be registered with the ATO by February 29.
