A number of Western Sydney battleground seats have some of the highest rates of informal voting in the country, with some booths registering one in five votes as invalid. The phenomenon is most pronounced in those communities with rich, culturally diverse backgrounds, including the Labor seat of Parramatta (with a margin of 1.3 per cent) and the Liberal seat of Banks (2.8 per cent).Labor-held Watson, in Sydney's south-west, recorded an informal vote of 14 per cent in 2013, and is home to the migrant-strong suburbs of Lakemba, Ashfield and Campsie.By contrast, the lowest rate of informal voting at the 2013 election was 3.3 per cent in the safe Liberal seat of Goldstein, in Melbourne's south-east.Chair of the Federation of Ethnic Communities Council of Australia Joseph Caputo said the high rate of informal voting in some seats was eroding Australia's democracy."It means that we do not get a real expression of the voting intentions," he said. "When you get double digit informal votes, it means the results do not reflect the community's wishes."ALP officials estimated some individual booths had recorded up to 20 per cent informal votes in some seats.Aris Anwaryar from the Afghan Support Association of NSW said the voting process could be very confusing, especially for those people familiar with other systems."There are a lot of names, a lot of parties. Now we're getting 15, 20, 30 candidates and people are getting confused," he said."This is a problem, a lot of people don't know how to vote and their ballot paper is useless."They want to nominate somebody and do the right thing but they don't fill the paperwork out the right way and they are not getting anything out of it."Lina Cabaero, coordinator of the peak group Asian Women at Work, has been holding a series of workshops to help educate voters on how to properly fill out their ballot papers.She said most of her members were Australian Vietnamese, Chinese and Filipina workers, who as migrant workers in low-paid jobs were among some of the most disadvantaged people in the electorate."They are the ones impacted by many issues that they face in their everyday lives," she said.Source: House of Representatives AEC websiteProfessor Rodney Smith from the school of Government and International Relations at Sydney University said high informal voting rates could have a big impact on the outcome of an election, especially in a marginal seat."Well it could have quite a considerable impact if you think some seats are won by 1 or 2 per cent, particularly if those electors would have voted overwhelmingly for one candidate," he said.Assistant Minister for Multicultural Affairs and Member for Reid in Sydney's west, Craig Laundy, said one of the big reasons for the high rate of informal voting in NSW was the difference between state and federal systems."To further complicate matters, there are the recent changes to the Senate. These changes and the differences between the NSW and federal systems make it confusing to everyone, not just the multicultural communities," he said.The Australian Electoral Commission said it had placed how to vote advertisements in a range of community language newspapers and radio programs, along with recruiting bilingual workers to staff polling stations on election day.Mr Laundy said the long-term answer could be technology."Informal voting will always be an issue if voting is not understood. Technology could be the long-term answer, with touch screens and so forth available in the booths," he said.For Ms Cabaero, voter education was the key."We know there are resources out there from the AEC, but a lot of them are web-based. For a lot of women I represent, they can't access the internet," she said."Part of their being integrated in the Australian society is to have the possibility of knowing the system, of casting their vote in Australia. "It has to be part of their education when they first come here."
