A planned national memorial to honour the 239 passengers and crew on board missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 has been put on hold in the wake of opposition.In 2014, state and federal governments committed to install a memorial at Perth's Elizabeth Quay, but many families of the victims — two thirds of whom were Chinese nationals — united to appeal to the Prime Minister and WA Government to shelve the idea.They claim the proposal for the memorial site came too soon, was in the wrong location, and more importantly did not involve their consultation.Earlier this year, Jiang Hui, who lost his mother aboard MH370 and acted as a spokesman for the families of Chinese victims, said monuments carried huge symbolic meaning in China."The establishment of such monuments usually takes place only after the matter has come to an end. But so far we don't know where our relatives are and where the plane is," he said. Australian woman Danica Weeks's husband Paul was onboard MH370, and she is pleased the memorial has been mothballed."I feel it's too soon because we haven't found the plane, so for me a memorial is something we do after at least we know where they are," she said."What if we find out they are somewhere else? It's a complex situation but we just feel like now isn't the right time."We are glad they want to do a memorial but I thought they would consult with the families, and it would be at a poignant time when they found the plane."Ms Weeks said she was in close contact with other affected families through chat groups, and believes an international memorial would be appropriate."We are from every background, French, Australian, Indian, Chinese, Malaysian," she said.We are one group, but we are from many different backgrounds. It's horrible but we are all in this together."For me it's a really big thing … it's a place where the boys can go an reflect and think 'Dad's out there'."I still think they have to search for this plane and they have to find it. Not only for us but for the aviation industry as a whole … without knowing what happened to it, it can happen again."  She said the worst part was not knowing where her husband was."It's just so hard. You have one simple question: 'Where is my husband?' It seems so simple, but four-and-half years on, the people responsible cannot tell you," she said."You go through emotions of anger, frustration and sadness at the reality of it all."He just walked out the front door and we never saw him again."The WA Government said the decision to put the memorial on hold was made after Premier Mark McGowan and Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack agreed it was inappropriate to go ahead with it at this time."This is a complex and highly sensitive matter, and the wellbeing of the relatives of those missing has always been our number one priority," Mr McGowan said."While some relatives support the memorial, others had concerns."It was decided in the best interests of all concerned not to proceed with the memorial at this point in time."Mr McGowan said he was very confident after consulting with the Australian relatives that the right decision had been made."I cannot imagine the grief experienced by the relatives of the 239 people on board, including the seven people who called Australia home, and I hold out hope that the plane will, one day, be found," he said.Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the Federal Government would continue to work with the families to ensure any work on the memorial was undertaken sensitively."I understand it has been deferred and that further consultations are to take place with the families, and to me that seems appropriate," Ms Bishop said. While the tender process for the artwork would not proceed, the state and federal governments said they acknowledged the artists who made submissions.
