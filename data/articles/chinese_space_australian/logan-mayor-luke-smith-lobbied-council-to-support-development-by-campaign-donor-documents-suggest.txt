The mayor of one of Australia's biggest local governments lobbied his own council to support a massive development by one of his key campaign donors, documents obtained by the ABC suggest. The internal council documents — including emails and file notes — appear to contradict sworn evidence by Logan City Mayor Luke Smith, given to Queensland's Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC) earlier this year.The Right to Information documents also raise questions about why the developer, Chinese-Australian Liansheng Yue, has so far avoided financial penalties, despite council officers issuing notices for serious environmental breaches by his company at his site in the suburb of Carbrook.These notices detailed alleged offences including the felling of trees, the unlawful dumping of soil, and the exposure of acid sulphate in the soil.Council documents state the work was done without any development approvals.As one council officer pointed out in a file note, "the maximum penalty per offence was $300,000"."I've been involved with the council where they have been chasing small lot holders for doing similar things and waving the big stick and fining them," said David Keogh from the Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland."So, I think it seems it is not even a level playing field."The ABC understands the State Government also issued fines for the removal of mangroves.Mr Yue's company's $750 million Carbrook resort development, known as "The Lakes", is one of the biggest in Logan.It was originally approved for 418 units, but an expanded development application for 1,500 units was lodged in 2016, and approved earlier this year.A council spokesperson told the ABC the enforcement notices were not sent to Mr Yue because the new development would provide an opportunity to "regularise" the alleged offences."Following the issuing of show-cause notices, the respondent [Mr Yue] took steps to engage a planning consultant and then regularise the offences by obtaining development approvals to regularise the work," the spokesperson said."Should the development not eventuate then council's practice would be to again seek remedy of the offence." But the development is yet to be constructed. The ABC understands the developer has donated more than $80,000 to Councillor Smith's campaign fund "Logan Futures", the bulk of it for his successful mayoral campaign, which was launched in 2015. Mr Yue's son, Terry, also attended a meeting of Cr Smith's Mayoral Campaign Executive in May 2015.According to a CCC exhibit of meeting minutes, the Yue family boat was offered to the campaign for "smaller high class [fundraising] events".In June this year, Terry Yue was called to give evidence at hearings for the CCC's Operation Belcarra investigation into four south-east Queensland local governments, including Logan council.He told the hearing he handed cash donations to Cr Smith at least once, and "there may have [been] more", but under questioning said he could not remember the exact amounts. At the same hearing, Cr Smith denied having any involvement with the development within council after receiving the donations.But he did acknowledge that he knew Liansheng Yue's company was preparing to lodge an application for an expanded development at The Lakes.Cr Smith said Terry Yue had told him before the March 2016 council election that his family's company was "looking at doing something larger"."They let me know because I was very clear to all donors that as soon as they helped me, I could not do anything to help them in council, and I drew a line very clearly on any conflicts of interest I had with donors, particularly Mr Yue," Cr Smith told the CCC's counsel during this year's Belcarra hearings.  Cr Smith said as soon as he was made aware of their intention, he reported it to the council's chief executive officer and two other senior officers."I did that because I asked them to keep me well away from the development because they were donors," the Mayor told the hearing.But the documents obtained by the ABC appear to contradict this testimony."Luke is pushing for the letter of support to go out to the Yue's — ostensibly for the purpose of raising finance," Logan's acting economic development manager, Darren Harrison, emailed to a colleague in December 2015.Mr Harrison appeared hesitant about council issuing the letter of support for the developer."I am keenly aware that previous letters of support have not gone down well from [council's economic development unit] where they have been contentious and this to me has the potential to be another," he wrote in the email.Another council officer also raised concerns in an email, pointing out that "we have had an ongoing enforcement action as well as previous action in 2014 [against the Yue's company].""We have issued a Show Cause Notice and soon will be issuing Enforcement Notices," he wrote, referring to environmental breaches at the development site in 2014 and 2015. But despite this, the letter of support for the Yue's development was issued by council on the same day. Addressed to Liansheng Yue, the letter confirmed that "we would once again wish to affirm our support for the development subject to meeting the standard planning and development requirements".It then reiterated that "council officers support the proposal"."I can confirm that a Resort Complex with combined total of 1,500 units short term accommodation units is an appropriate tourism use for this site," the letter stated. Council sources say that issuing a letter of support for a development is highly unusual, particularly for a project without final council approval. Local divisional councillor Darren Power said he was unaware of the letter until he was told by the ABC."I'm quite disturbed by the fact that it's to help for them to get finance," Councillor Power said."Could you imagine if all developers in the city wanted to get a supporting letter from council because they are doing a development to gather finance? I find this really, highly irregular."The ABC understands the Carbrook property was sold last month but the new owner and sale price is yet to be disclosed. By the time Liansheng Yue received the letter of support, Cr Smith had received more than $60,000 in donations from his companies.On July 8, 2015, Cr Smith's campaign fund banked a $20,000 donation from one of these companies.Two days later, a Logan council officer emailed Cr Smith an update on the allegations of unlawful earthworks and vegetation clearing at the Yue's site at The Lakes in 2014 and 2015.The officer provided it to Cr Smith "further to our telephone conversation".On July 20, Cr Smith met for a morning "coffee catch-up" with Terry Yue and the Yue's planner. That same morning, a manager requested urgent information from a compliance officer about the council's response to alleged environmental breaches because "Cr Luke Smith has requested I meet with him" about the issue.However, Cr Smith told the CCC's Belcarra hearings that he had "just friendly contact" with Terry Yue.In a statement to the ABC, Cr Smith said: "No conflict of interest existed for me in relation to the 2013 preliminary approval decision."An independent audit through the LGAQ (Local Government Association of Queensland) examined my involvement in the process and confirmed that I had no involvement whatsoever in the 2017 decision."Your questions in relation to meetings, updates etc all relate to 2015 — one year before the new DA was lodged and two years before the new DA was considered by council (of which I was not present)." The LGAQ investigation was finalised before Cr Smith gave evidence to the CCC hearings in June this year.In those same hearings, Mr Yue acknowledged he met with Cr Smith for coffees and dinner, and he had handed the then-mayoral candidate cash donations at least once.Asked on how many occasions he had given Cr Smith cash, Mr Yue said he could not recall.Terry Yue told the hearing he had known Cr Smith for at least five or six years."Because he was the chairman of [council's] economic development board, correct me if I say it wrong, and we met him through functions or meetings in council that would help us benefit — help us on the project, yes," Mr Yue said.The CCC has declined to comment.
