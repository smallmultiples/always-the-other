The Tasmanian Government's attempt to resurrect its failed anti-protest laws are a "face-saving exercise", former Greens leader Bob Brown says. The former senator challenged the laws in the High Court after being arrested in 2016 at a Forestry Tasmania logging site in Lapoinya, in north-west Tasmania.Ultimately, the High Court found the laws — a key 2014 Liberal election promise — were unconstitutional because they breached the right to freedom of political communication.But the Tasmanian Government has released a draft bill to fix that legislation, which would strip all mention of protesters and protesting from the laws to ensure they were consistent with the constitution.The proposed changes would repeal or amend almost every section of the original legislation, and would reframe the purpose of the laws as protection for businesses, rather than targeting protesters.Building Minister Sarah Courtney said the changes would fix the issues identified with the initial bill."We have sought advice, and we believe we have addressed the concerns raised by the High Court," Ms Courtney said. "We promised the people of Tasmania that we would take this to the Parliament, and indeed we started drafting legislation within the first 100 days as promised to the Tasmanian people." Ms Courtney said Tasmanians should be able to go about their work without the threat of being intentionally shut down, or their business being harmed. The 2014 laws — called the Workplaces (Protection from Protesters) Act 2014 — allowed police to stop protests on business premises and access areas before they started, and put in place $10,000 on-the-spot fines for individual protesters, and jail time for second offences.Mr Brown said the attempt to fix the laws was a waste of taxpayers' money, and the legislation should have been rescinded."These laws are redundant. This is not an exercise in doing anything special for business, it's an exercise in face-saving by the Premier at great expense to the Tasmanian taxpayer," Mr Brown said. Mr Brown also criticised the Government for releasing the information on a public holiday, with bushfires raging across the state.Ms Courtney said the decision to release it on the Australia Day public holiday was made to allow for as much time for consultation as possible.  University of Tasmania senior law lecturer Brendan Gogarty said the Government's move to criminalise "threatening" to interfere with a business was a potential breach of civil liberties, and could be a source of constitutional challenge."Someone on Facebook hot-headedly threatening to picket a Tasmanian business that treated them badly might find themselves up on criminal charges, which seems like more of a communist Chinese approach than a liberal Australian one," Mr Gogarty said.Mr Gogarty said the new bill would allow prosecutors to seek a jail term of up to 18 months to anyone interfering with Tasmanian businesses, and it was unclear whether the laws would survive another High Court challenge because although the illegitimate provisions had been removed, the spirit of the laws remained. He said the Government's proposed changes to almost every section of the act would add confusion to the legislation, and some protections in the original legislation would be removed."Its like a screenwriter being told their script is too hard to read and understand, but instead of re-writing it they cut half of the pages out and then issue a new script which you read alongside the first one to try to make sense of it," he said. "They're just piling confusion atop confusion and its going to make a considered debate challenging".Law Society president Evan Hughes said the draft changes appeared to be in better shape than the original act."Whether it's still inconsistent with some of those fundamental tenets or rights in the constitution, it's a very detailed amendment, we're going to need to go through that carefully," Mr Hughes said. "It's a very significant set of amendments. It's going to take a bit of time for us to be confident about whether there's further amendment we think is needed."Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Michael Bailey said the new bill would help strengthen protections for Tasmanian workplaces, including for the forestry industry, primary producers and the tourism industry.A spokesman for Labor said they would look closely at the new bill before determining their position. Earlier this month the ABC revealed that the Government spent $355,709 defending the laws in the High Court challenge brought by Mr Brown.The draft legislation is open for consultation until March 3.
