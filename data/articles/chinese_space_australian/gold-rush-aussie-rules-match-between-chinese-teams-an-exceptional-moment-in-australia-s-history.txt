Lu Tuwang is not your average 20-year-old Australian Rules footballer. He grew up in the southern Chinese city of Dongguan, in Guangdong Province and only has basic English language skills — but his passion and commitment to playing and growing the game at home are unwavering."Since first engaging with Australian football in 2014 I fell in love with it and I've been playing it since," Mr Lu said."I was a curious boy and I loved sports, so that's how I got involved."The star player of the Dongguan Blues is in Australia to learn more about the sport and to develop his skills.Mr Lu arrived in Melbourne earlier this month, and will spend three months in Australia playing with the Monash Blues Football Club. His first game with the club is this weekend."The first week of training was pretty hard," he said. "But I still really enjoyed it because it's a very skilful and interesting sport and I learnt a lot."The young man said many university students in China loved sport, but there was a lack of understanding of Australian Rules football.Mr Lu said he sees his future in football, and he hopes to represent his country and get involved in coaching young people to help grow the sport's popularity.It may seem the young man is forging new ground, but China's connection to Australian Rules football has deep roots in Victoria's gold rush towns in the 1890s.More than 120 years after Chinese teams played football in front of a crowd of thousands in regional Ballarat, there is a push to harness that history to help navigate a cultural exchange between the two countries. A decade after Victoria was transformed by word getting out about significant gold discoveries, the gold rush had brought close to 25,000 Chinese men and a handful of women to Victoria by the early 1860s. As the end of the 19th century neared, large Chinese populations remained in towns such as Ballarat and Bendigo.On August 25, 1892, a lively parade through the streets of Ballarat preceded the pivotal moment two Chinese football teams — the miners and the gardeners — stepped out onto the Eastern Oval in football stockings and red sashes to play in a charity match. The day after the match, the Evening Star newspaper described the game as a "brilliant success" with about 5,000 spectators."After a splendidly contested game, in which the spectators were treated to much fun, the gardeners won by two goals, the scores at the close being — gardeners, four goals, one behind; miners, two goals, five behinds," an article read.Other newspapers reported that in the lead up to the game local young men learnt Chinese phrases so they could barrack for the teams. Fireworks were let off as the game was underway, and a band of Chinese musical performers led the parade before the game and continued to play throughout the event.The game on that August afternoon, well-documented in historical records, was the first in a series of matches played between 1892 and 1896 that would become known as the Chinese Football Premiership.Victoria University associate professor in sport history Dr Rob Hess wants more people to know about this exceptional moment in Australia's history, particularly given the recent emergence of a push by the AFL to grow its presence in Asia."It's an inconspicuous, hidden part of Australia rules history," he said."Given this remarkable, 100-year-old connection with the Chinese, (I'm surprised) more is not made of that when they play their annual Shanghai matches and in terms of promoting the code to China."Mr Lu has had his heart set on playing at the game at the highest level in his home country since he first started playing Australian Rules football with the Dongguan Blues Football Club in 2014.He said he fell in love with the sport, but not many people in China know about Australian Rules football, and more are familiar with soccer.Mr Lu, an all-rounder, visited Ballarat earlier this month and stood on the same ground where those first games involving Australia's early Chinese communities were played. Dongguan Blues' Australian liaison manager Darrell Egan, originally from Victoria, said highlighting the history of football in Ballarat's Chinese community could be a crucial step for sparking more interest in the game in China.Chinese Australian Cultural Society Ballarat vice president Charles Zhang said setting up a game of football in Ballarat with Chinese players to celebrate the history could provide a great tourism boost for the regional city."With a good understanding of the history and culture we can achieve a lot more," Mr Zhang said."Sport is an international language, and you don't have to understand each other to play sport together — history has already proved that."Sport can breach everything and [it] can iron out all the differences."Dr Hess said it was significant that the Anglo-Saxon community in Ballarat was so accepting of the Chinese Football Premiership."Adopting the quintessential Australian sport, Aussie rules, was a road to acceptance," Dr Hess said."This appealed to the Anglo-Saxon community as well. "Of course it was a novelty, the annual Chinese Premiership Game. "It was 'let's go down, hear the firecrackers go off, let's hear the Chinese music'.""It helped normalise them [the Chinese community] in a way. They were playing the Australian game just a few years before the White Australia policy came in."The first piece of legislation passed by the government in 1901 was the White Australia Policy, and yet here they are in 1896 putting on a charity fundraiser of two teams made up of Chinese players, and the crowd was applauding them and barracking for them in Chinese.""How does that work?"Dr Hess said despite newspaper articles and book chapters being published telling the story of the games, most Australians do not know it."There's still an endless fascination, and an endless forgetting, of this story," he said.
