For two years Perth's sick children have waited to get access to the new state-of-the-art $1.2 billion Perth Children's Hospital. So how did we get here?The Barnett Government announces a new children's hospital is to be built on the QEII site at Nedlands, to be opened by the end of 2015.John Holland is announced as the managing contractor for the construction of the $1.2 billion hospital.Treasurer Christian Porter says the company won the tender because of its "proven track record in successfully delivering major local and international capital works projects."Construction begins on the hospital at Nedlands, with then premier Colin Barnett turning a sod at the site.The 274-bed hospital is to include a paediatric trauma centre, a research and education facility and adolescent mental health beds. The name of the new facility is announced as Perth Children's Hospital and its capacity is increased to 298 beds.But the government resists pressure to build an extra floor to create a bigger a hospital.The opening of the new hospital is pushed back to April 2016.It was initially supposed to open in 2015.Kim Hames blames the delay on issues with the construction company and the decision to reconfigure the hospital's layout to install an extra 24 rooms.However, he says construction is on track to be completed by the end of November.A number of contractors say there have been long delays in payment for their work on the hospital's construction.Some say they are owed as much as $9 million.The government is unable to say when the hospital will open after revealing that construction will not be completed by November 30 as expected.It says the reasons include delays in receiving interior panels from the Philippines and a change in ownership of John Holland.The opening of the new hospital is delayed again, with the government announcing it will open towards the end of 2016.Almost half a kilometre of water piping in the ceiling of the new hospital is found to be faulty.The piping will need to be replaced, but the government insists the issue will not further delay the project.It is revealed that 900 fire door frames on the hospital will have to be replaced because they do not comply with Australian standardsTina Chinery, the head of the new hospital, resigns to take a position in Queensland.But new health minister John Day says the hospital will still be open by the end of the year.Lead is identified in the drinking water supply at dangerous levels, but is not publicly reported.At least half of the distinctive green panels that make up the facade of the problem-plagued hospital will have to be ripped down and replaced after revelations they were damaged in transit to the site.A burst water pipe floods the basement of the hospital.Fragments of asbestos are found in roof panels of the hospital.John Holland says the roof will have to be replaced, while the Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) warns hundreds of workers may have been exposed to the deadly material.The builder says the remedial work required could delay the hospital's opening. It is later revealed the panels, supplied by Australian-Chinese firm Yuanda, were not adequately audited in China, where they were manufactured.John Holland fails to meet the scheduled building handover date of August 4.The government now says it doesn't know when the hospital will open.Meanwhile, doctors say the ongoing delays are compromising patient care at the ageing Princess Margaret Hospital.It is revealed that the government is paying $500,000 a month to a parking contractor to manage hundreds of unused parking bays at the delayed Perth Children's Hospital.It is revealed high levels of lead have been detected in the water at the site of the hospital.The health minister is unable to guarantee the hospital will open by the end of the year.The source of to asbestos at the hospital is found to be non-compliant panels manufactured in China, while builder John Holland is found to have had inadequate dust control measures.Debate continues about the source of the lead contamination, however, with Mr Barnett announcing the source of the contamination has been identified as coming from outside the hospital.But Building Commissioner Peter Gow says authorities do not "have a clear idea of where the lead has come from" The premier later "guarantees" the hospital will be open by the end of the year.It emerges that the hospital will not open until well into 2017.Labor says the situation has become "farcical".Flushing the hospital's pipes with millions of litres of water fails to either solve the problem or identify the source of the lead contamination.Mr Barnett admits the government still does not know what is causing the contamination.The pipes are flushed with iced water in a further bid to solve the problem.The AMA lashes out over what it says is inaction over low staff morale at Princess Margaret Hospital, which is now being kept open far longer than was expected.The government formally confirms practical completion of the hospital but says it will bill John Holland for the cost of trying to fix the lead contamination issue.A phosphate solution will be pumped through the pipes to neutralise the lead.A Building Commission audit finds lead contamination in the new Perth Children's Hospital's water supply most likely came from state-managed pipes which circle the whole medical precinct, as well as the brass fittings in the worksite itself.The commissioner, Mr Gow, says as far back as last September, the commission had "fairly clear proof" the ring main at the medical precinct contained lead.The government releases its own report by the Health and Treasury departments blaming leaching from brass fittings, "potentially exacerbated by dezincification" as the source of elevated lead levels still encountered at the facility. It also found the lead contamination continued after a section of pipe identified by the building commission had been removed, making it unlikely it was the explanation of the persistent lead problem. There were elevated levels of lead, copper and zinc found in the pipe — a dead leg attached to the ring main, but not in the hospital — further eliminating it as the source of lead contamination.The head of the WA Child and Adolescent Health Service (CAHS) Professor Frank Daly resigns as a review of staff morale at Princess Margaret Hospital finds there has been a fundamental failure of leadership within the hospital. The terms of a wide-ranging inquiry into the management of the problem-plagued Perth Children's Hospital Project are announced by the powerful parliamentary committee overseeing the inquiry.It also emerges that stainless steel pipes in the facility are being eroded at an unusually fast rate, and some already need to be replaced. A report by the state's chief health officer Tarun Weeramanthri finds brass fittings had corroded, leaching lead into the water system.Professor Weeramanthri recommended the fittings, contained in 1,200 mixing valve assembly boxes, be removed and replaced.A new problem strikes the hospital with the potentially deadly legionella bacteria detected during routine water testing.Health authorities confirm 14 instances of legionella were found in warm water outlets, a shower head and a drinking water fountain, saying the "results detected were at the low end of the accepted scale".
