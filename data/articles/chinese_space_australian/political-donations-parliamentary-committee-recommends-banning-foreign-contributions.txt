Political donations from foreign companies and individuals should be banned, a parliamentary committee has recommended.The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters recommended foreign citizens and entities be banned from donating to Australian registered political parties, associated entities and third parties.In a report issued on Friday, the Committee further proposed the ban be extended to other political actors who may channel the money into political activities.It also recommended harsher penalties for those who break the rules. The call for reform comes amid ongoing concern over foreign actors trying to influence Australian politics after Russia was found to have influenced the recent US election.There is bipartisan support for the move to ban donations to political parties, but Labor and the Greens have opposed the extension of the ban to other groups.In a dissenting report, Labor said the move could restrict the ability of not-for-profits to engage in the national debate about issues such as overseas aid.It said that proposal should be subject to a further inquiry.Opposition Leader Bill Shorten addressed media on the report on Friday, saying "there's no doubt in my mind that Australians want to see greater transparency and greater accountability"."We can keep working through the issues together," he said."We've got to make sure Australians have confidence in our political process."Left wing lobby group Get Up has also accused the Coalition of trying to silence its critics.But committee chair and Liberal Senator Linda Reynolds told the ABC that it "in no way" targeted charities, universities or other groups who played an important role in democracy."The report very clearly indicates that this is only targeted at those who get involved in political campaigning," she said."So Get Up already comes under regulation of the Australian Electoral Commission because they politically campaign and they put in third party returns." The Greens also raised concerns the ban would not include groups such as the Minerals Council of Australia because it was funded by large membership fees, which were not technically donations.But Senator Reynolds said the ban would create an even playing field."Everybody will be subject to the same rules," she said."So anybody who participates in the Australian electoral process and wants to influence Australian elections will be subject to these requirements."The foreign donation ban, if enforced, would not apply to dual Australian citizens either in Australia or overseas, or to non-Australian permanent residents in Australia.Senator Reynolds said she was confident there would be change."Everybody on the committee agreed that the Electoral Act must be changed to prohibit foreign donations," she said."How it plays out in the Parliament we'll have to wait and see, but we all want what's in the national interest and I believe a blanket ban on all organisations is the fairest and most transparent way to go."Earlier this year, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull emphasised the need for donation reform.Addressing the National Press Club in January, Mr Turnbull foreshadowed changes to foreign donations."Overseas events, as well as those here in Australia, have shown us that the Australian people must be confident that our electoral process is free from foreign intervention or interference," he said."I believe Australians expect us to ensure that only Australians, and Australian businesses, can seek to influence Australian elections."Chinese donors have contributed millions to both major political parties since 2013, prompting a warning from former treasurer Wayne Swan that foreign donations could be "skewing" political decision-making.
