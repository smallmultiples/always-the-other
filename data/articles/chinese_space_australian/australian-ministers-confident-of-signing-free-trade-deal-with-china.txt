Australian Government ministers are confident a free trade deal with China will be ready in time for president Xi Jinping's visit to Australia.Mr Xi will visit Australia next week for the G20 summit and both Canberra and Beijing would like to use the occasion to sign the free trade agreement.In order to achieve this, negotiators would have to virtually finalise an agreement today, Friday. Securing a deal with Australia's largest trading partner is seen as a major potential boost to the economy of both countries.After nearly a decade of talks, the Australian and Chinese delegations are down to just two sticking points.  Australian Trade Minister Andrew Robb would not be pushed on what those points may be."There are only two actually but I'm not going to get into those because I think it's quite unproductive to have a negotiation in public," he told reporters in Beijing."So we will deal with that in confidence I think."Mr Robb said both sides were working hard.He said while freer movement of labour could be a component of the deal, it would not undermine wages in Australia. He also ruled out Chinese workers coming to Australia on wage rates below those currently stipulated in Australian law.The Labor Party has raised concerns Australian sugar producers may be cut out of the deal, which is likely, and the dairy industry could also be unfairly disadvantaged.Australian dairy farmers have been lobbying for a "New Zealand Plus" package which would give them the same conditions their Kiwi counterparts have had since 2008.The country's 6,500 farmers are eagerly watching developments after losing out on FTAs with Japan and Korea.Australia's Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce today announced a possible live cattle deal with China, which he said "has the potential market size of a million head a year" and worth up to $1 billion annually.Queensland Premier Campbell Newman said the prospect of the live cattle deal gives producers something to hope for when the drought ends."I'll be quite unequivocal about it: it's fantastic news for Queensland and it's fantastic news for cattle producers in this state," he said."We made a commitment to double agricultural production in Queensland, access to export markets in this sort of way is just critically important."But the president of the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association said cattle producers would struggle to supply animals to China at the expense of other markets, including Indonesia."If the million head do go to China they've got to be at the discount of other markets. It will certainly have to be taking market share away from other avenues," David Warriner said.
