Federal Hunter MP Joel Fitzgibbon does not believe Labor's refusal to guarantee support for the China Australia Free Trade Agreement (FTA) has harmed the image of Australian agriculture in China.Labor says it will not guarantee its support for the agreement until there is a commitment that jobs are filled by Australians, ahead of Chinese workers.There are concerns that news has not been well received in China, with potential trade partners now looking to South America to fill supply contracts.But Mr Fitzgibbon said those rumours are not true."I've spoken to a number of people who know the Chinese culture well ,and the Chinese attitude on these things," he said."They say the Chinese absolutely understand Australia's concern - our determination to ensure that in every possible case jobs are filled by Australians."So, no, I don't believe the Chinese would be very concerned."Mr Fitzgibbon said concerns about Chinese workers taking local jobs could be addressed if the government enforced labour market testing."It just ensures here, domestically, that any 457 visas, or proposals, have to be labour market tested in Australia to ensure that there aren't Australians available to do that work, that's very easy to do here in Australia," he said."It doesn't need any agreement with the Chinese, and it certainly doesn't offend the FTA agreement with the Chinese."
