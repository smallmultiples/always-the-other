The head of the Defence Department has rejected concerns about the lease of the Port of Darwin as "alarmist" and "absurd", while insisting his department considered all security risks before giving its blessing. But Defence Secretary Dennis Richardson conceded it was an "oversight" that Australia did not advise the United States that Chinese-owned company Landbridge had been successful in its bid to run the port before it was publicly announced. Today Mr Richardson appeared before a parliamentary inquiry to give a detailed explanation of how Defence considered the implications of the lease, in the run-up to his decision to advise Treasury that Defence had no objection to the move.He said Defence assessed the risks of a shutdown or sabotage, cyber attacks, the port being used for intelligence gathering or stealing intellectual property. "We did our due diligence very carefully over an extended period of time in respect of the Port of Darwin," Mr Richardson said. "Nothing that has been said since the announcement has given us pause for thought."He revealed he ordered a special review of the Landbridge deal after security experts in Australia raised espionage concerns following the announcement. "After a couple of weeks of it I personally thought, 'gee, have we missed something?'."But he said intelligence agencies backed his initial assessment."The written advice I received on that was that there were no significant implications and it was fine." Mr Richardson rubbished concerns from security analysts that the deal could give the Chinese navy access to the port as "alarmist nonsense" and "simply absurd". "The visit of foreign naval vessels anywhere around the world requires diplomatic clearance and that power resides within the Federal Government," he said.Mr Richardson said consultations were carried out at the highest levels of government including the National Security Committee of Cabinet, which was when a review was ordered into laws that allow states to sell strategic assets without scrutiny from the Foreign Investment Review Board.Meanwhile, Landbridge has also argued its owner is not a Chinese Communist party member, nor does he have links to the Chinese army.The company's Australian managing director, Michael Hughes, refuted the allegations against Landbridge's owner, billionaire Ye Cheng.There is no armed militia in Landbridge. "Mr Ye is not a member of the [People's Liberation Army], has never been a member of the PLA," Mr Hughes said."It's a private company, he's not a member of the Communist party, he is a member of the CPPCC."It's an advisory body to the Parliament, I believe it's got something over 2,000 delegates, they're drawn from a whole range of walks of life."He's one of a small number of representatives from private business."Mr Hughes likened the committee to those which operate in Australia, drawing on the knowledge and expertise of business leaders to help advise government policy â€” not a committee that drives his business. "This is a private company driven by commercial drivers," he said.Concerns have also been raised about whether Landbridge has its own militia operating at one of its Chinese ports."There is no armed militia in Landbridge," Mr Hughes said."It runs a large port, currently six or seven times the size of the Darwin Port, it has a refinery adjacent to the port."It has security, it has an emergency response team, but there is no armed militia, there is no armed personnel anywhere in Landbridge's employ on its facilities."Landbridge also met with the Foreign Investment Review Board, before it became apparent the sale did not meet the threshold for their intervention.US President Barack Obama raised the Port of Darwin lease with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on the sidelines of the APEC summit in Manila last month, and reportedly said the US should have been given a "heads up".At the time Mr Turnbull told the media he suggested to the President the deal was no secret and he could have benefited from a subscription to the Northern Territory News. Mr Richardson said he briefed the deputy secretary of the US department of defence, Bob Work, in a pre-arranged meeting within 36 hours of the announcement. "Any criticism that we should have, just as a matter of common sense, advised the US in advance I think is fair criticism and I take accountability of that," he said."I believe it would have been the sensible thing to give them prior advice of that." But he took a swipe at US ambassador John Berry, pointing out there had been coverage in the Australian media. "If the shoe was on the other foot and I was the Australian ambassador to Washington I don't think you would be accepting that it was the responsibility of the US, you'd be pointing the finger at me as the ambassador, and why wasn't I up with what was happening publicly in the country."
