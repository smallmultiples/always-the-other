The Australian share market has slumped more than 2 per cent, dropping back below the 5,000-point level, on very weak Chinese manufacturing data.By the close the benchmark ASX 200 was down 105 points, or 2.1 per cent, to 4,998, while the broader All Ordinaries index was off 98 points to 5,033.The fall in the All Ordinaries means that around $30 billion was wiped off the value of Australian listed companies today.The market extended morning falls of just over 1 per cent after a leading private sector gauge of Chinese manufacturing showed the sector shrinking for the seventh straight month.More worryingly for analysts and investors, the pace of Chinese manufacturing decline was the fastest since the country was struggling to emerge from the global financial crisis in March 2009.That Chinese industrial weakness saw most sectors of the Australian share market hit hard, but none harder than resources stocks.The big Australian, BHP Billiton, became quite a bit smaller with a 4.4 per cent slump to $22.80, its lowest share price since November 2008 and rapidly approaching its financial crisis closing low of $21.10.Major rival Rio Tinto was hit with a 2.4 per cent slide, while Fortescue was down 5.5 per cent.BHP Billiton spin-off South32 was slammed, plummeting 5.7 per cent to $1.415, only just off its record low of $1.395 and around 40 per cent off its high of $2.45 soon after being spun-off from its parent earlier this year.Banks are some of the best bellwethers for investor perception on the Australian economy, and the drubbing they took today does not bode well for the outlook. Oil and gas prices are came under further downward pressure from weaker Chinese demand, causing steep falls in the energy sector.Woodside was off 2.9 per cent to $28.80, while previously harder hit smaller rivals Santos (2.8 per cent), Origin (2.8 per cent) and Oil Search ( 1 per cent) all had slightly more modest declines today.Commodities were not the only sector in the firing line, however, with the big four banks suffering a steep sell-off.Westpac, heavily exposed to Australian home loans, slumped 3.7 per cent to $29.97.Asia-exposed ANZ dropped 3 per cent, as did home loan heavy CBA which closed at $71.58, while NAB dropped 2.3 per cent.IG market analyst Angus Nicholson said the big four were hit by concerns about the impact of China's slowdown on Australia's economic growth."Banks are some of the best bellwethers for investor perception on the Australian economy, and the drubbing they took today does not bode well for the outlook," he wrote in a note.Retailers were also hit by similar concerns around Australia's economic growth, employment and consumer spending outlook.Wesfarmers dropped 2.2 per cent to $38.18, Woolworths 1.7 per cent to a fresh three-year low of $24.38, Harvey Norman 4.3 per cent and Myer another 2.3 per cent to just 85 cents.Telstra was down 0.9 per cent to $5.62, despite being considered a 'defensive' stock.However, a couple of companies were bucking the trend: Qantas was up 0.3 per cent to $3.69 on the positive impact of lower oil, and therefore jet fuel, prices.Medibank Private was also 0.9 per cent higher at $2.36.Australia's market was far from alone in being sold down: Hong Kong's Hang Seng was off an even steeper 2.8 per cent late in its trading session, with Shanghai's main index down 1.5 per cent. Tokyo was closed for a holiday.The Australian dollar was hit by the Chinese data as well, falling to 70.4 US cents by 4:50pm (AEST).
