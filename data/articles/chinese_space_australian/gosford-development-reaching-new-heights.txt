A $180 million development that includes three towers, one soaring 34 storeys high (110 metres), is being considered by Gosford Council.The proposal combines residential units, hotel rooms, retail, restaurants and a walk through area connecting the CBD to the waterfront.Local architect Caine King is excited at the prospect of changing the face of Gosford."The first thing we really see is a derelict city, that's our welcome to Gosford City. I really hope for Gosford's sake that we have the benefit of having this development," he said.The first thing we really see is a derelict city, that's our welcome to Gosford City. I really hope for Gosford's sake that we have the benefit of having this development. The man behind the development is Australian-based Chinese businessman Jian Wang. He came to Australia after his son started studying in Sydney five years ago and was impressed by what Gosford had to offer. He thinks the city's proximity to Sydney, its waterside location and potential revenue makes it a winning combination.The three towers would range in height from 26 to 34 storeys, the tallest tower in Mann Street, twice the height currently permitted in Gosford, and the biggest stumbling block for the proposed development.Demolition at the vacant Frogys site in Mann Street is due to begin next month.Local Peter Carstairs is concerned about pressure on the local area with several other developments in the pipeline, including the redevelopment of site of Gosford Public School. "Green space is really going to be under pressure, and so is the traffic and roads," said the spokesman for the Gosford Waterfront Action Group.The site has been the subject of several failed development attempts, dating back over a decade.The Mayor of Gosford, Lawrie McKinna says the multi-million dollar development is a significant step forward for the city."Potentially we're going to have three major developments happening in the main street of Gosford and you can just imagine how many local tradesmen are going to be working there" he said. Last month, plans were lodged with council for the redevelopment of Dutton's Tavern and Bistro, Mann Street to include apartments.Meanwhile, the Central Coast Regional Development Corporation has received an undisclosed number of expressions of interest for the re-development of the former Gosford public school site.Councillor McKinna says the owner of the CBD's main shopping complex, the Imperial centre, has also indicated he is keen to further invest in the city."He's looking at other opportunities now because he feels time's right for Gosford and the coast - that things are moving ahead.   The centre is currently being refurbished, with stage one expected to be complete by mid this year.For more local stories go to the ABC Central Coast news page
