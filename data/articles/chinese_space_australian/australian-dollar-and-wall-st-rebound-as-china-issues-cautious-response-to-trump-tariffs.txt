Australian shares are set to rise in early trade after a rebound in foreign markets, as optimism about earnings season trumped fears of a US-China trade war.However, China warned that foreign firms operating in its borders would suffer in a trade war, and said no talks to end the impasse were currently underway. "We hope US firms can do more to lobby the US Government, and work hard to defend their own interests," Chinese commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng told a media briefing."The precondition for negotiations is trust."From what I've learnt, both sides [the US and China] have not been in touch about restarting talks."On Wednesday, Beijing said it would hit back after the Trump administration threatened to impose 10 per cent tariffs on $US200 billion worth of Chinese goods.It has yet to announce how it will respond after the latest round of US tariffs.China only imported about $US130 billion worth of goods from America last year.In order to retaliate, China might increase the size of the tariffs it imposes or resort to what it calls "qualitative" measures, which US businesses fear could mean reprisals against their China operations.The Australian dollar bounced back from yesterday's sharp sell-off, lifting 0.5 per cent to 74.07 US cents.Yesterday, it reached a one-week low of 73.6 US cents."The China-US trade dynamics are proving very difficult for markets to read," ANZ foreign exchange strategist Giulia Specchia said."Defensive positioning in the Australian dollar should remain in focus until clear policies emerge from both countries."The local currency has also risen to 56 British pence, about 63.5 Euro cents and 83.3 Japanese yen."The intra‑day strength in the Australian dollar was driven by higher equity markets, higher base metal prices, and modest narrowing of global credit spreads," Commonwealth Bank's chief currency strategist Richard Grace said.Wall Street's Nasdaq index hit a fresh record, gaining 1.4 per cent to 7,823, following a rally in big-name technology stocks.This was driven largely by Facebook (+2.2pc) and Amazon (+2.4pc), which also hit record highs — as well as Microsoft (+2.2pc) and Google (+2.5pc).The Dow Jones index rose by a hefty 224 points, or 0.9 cent, to 24,925, and the S&P 500 also lifted nearly 0.9 per cent.Earnings will take centre stage on Friday (local time), when some big Wall Street banks, including JPMorgan Chase, report their results.S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post second-quarter profit growth of around 21 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters data.In a sign that labour market conditions remained robust in early July, weekly jobless claims hit a two-month low last week.Jobless claims by 18,000 to 214,000, according to the latest US Labor Department figures.The headline consumer price index barely rose in June (+0.1pc) — but the underlying trend continued to point to a steady build-up of inflation pressure that could keep the Federal Reserve on a path of gradual US interest rate hikes.
