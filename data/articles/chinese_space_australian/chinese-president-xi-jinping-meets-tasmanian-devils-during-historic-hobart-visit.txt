Chinese president Xi Jinping met Hobart school children, patted Tasmanian devils, planted a tree and visited Mount Wellington during his landmark trip to Tasmania.The president and his wife, Madame Peng Liyuan, spent the day in Hobart for a round of engagements.The visit by the man considered the third most-powerful leader in the world was tipped to open up economic opportunities and cultural ties. He is the highest-profile head of state to visit Tasmania and despite being only a few hours long, it required a massive security and logistical operation.Even Mount Wellington, which forms the backdrop to the southern most capital, had to be shutdown to bushwalkers ahead of Mr Xi's private visit to the summit late in the day.    After stepping off the plane just after 11am (AEDT), Madame Peng warmly embraced school students waiting to greet them and present the pair with a Tasmanian-made lavender bear, which is popular with Chinese tourists.The president spent several minutes speaking to students and other guests before heading to Government House.There he met Year 5 students from Launceston's Scotch Oakburn College Junior School, who sent him letters as part of their Mandarin class.Among them was Chloe Edwards."He said that he wanted to welcome us to China to play and to study and to look at Beijing and all of the sights," she said.He also planted a Yulan Magnolia tree, the official city flower of Shanghai. But the highlight for Chinese media at Government House was seeing the president come face to face with six-month-old Tasmanian devils Bella, Possum and Lulu.Wildlife advocate Greg Irons hoped the visit would boost the profile of efforts to save the species from a deadly facial tumour."It's great to have devils beaming across lounge rooms in China," he said.The historic visit to the island state had its beginnings 30 years ago when a sister-state relationship was signed with Mr Xi's Fujian province. At Government House the presidential couple signed a visitor's book and met the family of late Tasmanian premier Jim Bacon, who first met Mr Xi in China more than 20 years ago.China is a major export market for Tasmanian seafood which was on the lunch menu along with other local fare representing all corners of the state.In his lunch address, Mr Xi referred to the rapid growth in the cooperation between Tasmania and China, which is the state's largest trading partner.China is also the state's biggest source of international students and a growing tourism market.He said cooperation in the Antarctic was "a bright spot" in the relationship. He was joined at Government House by Prime Minister Tony Abbott.The two leaders discussed Chinese investment with delegates at an investment conference which was staged to coincide with the visit.Mr Xi later toured the Chinese icebreaker, XueLong, and signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) designed to cement Hobart as a gateway to the Antarctic for the Chinese ship and promote collaboration on scientific research in the region.The two leaders crossed via video link to the Chinese and Australian Antarctic stations to talk to expeditioners based there.The Chinese researchers based at Zhongshan told their leader it was stormy and cold where they were but they felt the warmth of his touch.Australia's Environment Minister Greg Hunt described the new agreement with China as a breakthrough. "This Antarctic cooperation MOU is a coup for Tasmania, it's a coup for Hobart," he said."This is about a partnership with the world's most populous country, this is about Hobart being a gateway to Antarctica and the world knowing it."Conservationists dressed as penguins took the River Derwent to coincide with the visit.Spokeswoman Amanda Sully said the protest was aimed at China's vote against a recent attempt to expand an Antarctic marine reserve. "We are here on a very big boat, with banners to welcome the president and ask him to please support marine reserves in the Antarctic Ocean," she said.A small group of Tibetans living in Tasmania also held a peacefully protest near Hobart's cenotaph where the presidential cavalcade will drive past.Among them was Greens MP Nick Mckim who wanted to draw attention to the fight for freedom from Chinese rule.But also on the cavalcade route were about 400 members of the Tasmanian Chinese community who had been vetted by Chinese authorities.Gar Foong moved to Hobart from China more than 50 years ago and said the visit would put Tasmania on the map."Up to now, if I talked to a lot of overseas friends they say, 'Where's Tasmania?', he said."But now with so many people in China watching on TV, because of the president's visit, they all know where Tasmania is."Road closures connected to the security detail for Mr Xi's motorcade caused traffic congestion around the city.
