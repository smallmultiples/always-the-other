Shoppers and parents have shared their concerns about access to infant formula following an ABC investigation into a network of Chinese buyers targeting premium baby formula products.  More than a dozen people contacted the ABC from cities throughout Australia noting their experiences of Chinese personal shoppers — known as daigou — buying large amounts of formula.One customer — who did not want to be named — sent an image of a Coles staff member with a rack of a2 baby formula near the checkout."I saw him [the worker] giving two baby formula cans from the rack to the cashier," they said."The cashier was scanning two at a time, the lady was paying with a credit card for those two tins and her partner was carrying those two tins, putting them in a bag so it conceals [it] while he [was] going out of the shopping centre to the carpark."The employee gave two more formulas from the rack he had…  this was going on and on until the rack was finally empty."The man said he challenged the male staffer, who replied that he wasn't breaking any laws.The customer made a complaint to Coles.The ABC does not suggest that Coles, the shoppers or their distributors are operating illegally."Whatever policies they have put in place of limit of two transactions for baby formula — just follow that policy," the customer told the ABC.The ABC understands an exporter that sends formula overseas is based nearby.A Coles spokeswoman said the company was "committed to ensuring our customers have access to infant formula and as a result we are limiting sales quantities to two units per customer"."We are working with our suppliers on solutions to improve availability for customers," the spokesperson said. "Where formula is unavailable, we encourage customers to speak with their local store manager." Some supermarkets have put formula behind the counter and purchase limits were introduced earlier this month.Many parents told the ABC they had seen Chinese personal shoppers buying tins in bulk or returning several times to a store, or working as a team to buy stocks until the shelves were bare.Adelaide mum Rachel Ebert said she had felt panicked when the formula brand for her one-year-old daughter Grace was not easily available from supermarkets and chemists.She said when she initially chose the a2 brand, which comes from New Zealand, she "didn't think it was going to be this hard to get". "[I'm] just noticing that there is no baby formula, especially the a2 brand," she said."It seems to be always empty."Ms Ebert and her husband Andy said they had been forced to ring around stores to check formula supplies to secure enough to feed their baby."At first I knew I had a full tin so I was just looking around and thought 'okay, I've got time' but then it got down and there was further panic like we're very short now," she said.The pair did a "massive search" before finding tins. Ms Ebert said she felt companies had a responsibility to continue to supply parents at a local level."You feel like in a bit of a panic because your child is having that formula," she said."I don't think people understand that like you can't just swap and change and you feel a bit let down."I guess the point is look after Australian mums before you start [exporting] and I know everything is about money but we have babies too and we need to look after our babies."Other parents said it was not just premium-priced dairy-based formula that was hard to source.Adelaide mum Allira Power said before her son Charles turned one she always made sure she had extra tins of his formula, Novolac Allergy, at home in case supplies were low in stores. "Charles has an allergy to dairy — the dairy protein, not just lactose," she said."As far as I know there are only two on the market and this one had the best reviews."Now that Charles is over one, it's not an issue because he can have soy or almond milk, but prior to that we always made sure we had extra tins, bought it weeks in advance of running low and if we did get stuck, we would just have to track down the formula by calling chemists."Ms Power said when it was hard to source she felt "extremely anxious"."It's my responsibility to nourish my baby and when I forget to stock up and then can't get him what he needs, it can be really distressing." Consumer group Choice spokeswoman Erin Turner said it appeared supply issues for Australian parents were more localised than the widespread problems experienced in 2015."It stems from safety issues and [Chinese] parents wanting to do the right thing by their children," Ms Turner said.China has had several food contamination scares, including the deaths of six babies in 2008 from melamine-tainted milk.She said there had been a "shift in the market" when some companies began selling directly to China but noted the localised shortages in Australia would "frustrate" parents.Organic and brands promoting healthy benefits were impacted the most."Some supermarkets have put caps on purchasing and it does help," she said.She said while it was clear that stores that did not monitor limits had shortages, Choice was not calling for regulation changes on formula sales.The a2 Milk Company Asia Pacific chief executive Peter Nathan said parents in China saw formula sold in Australia as safe given the country's high food standards.Mr Nathan noted that not all formulas were targeted by formula shoppers and he believed buyers' "aspirations" coupled with higher incidences of lactose intolerance led to Chinese consumers wanting the formula with only the a2 protein for their children.He said the company sold formula online to Chinese customers and had a Chinese-branded formula, which was different from that on Australian shelves, in about 10,000 stores in the country. The company is continuing to increase its formula production.Mr Nathan said stock was kept for Australian parents who could not buy it in stores and was available through the company's online store.Bayer Australia spokesman William Malpass said it was not experiencing any shortage of Novalac Allergy supply in Australia.Mr Malpass said the company was supplying the formula to all Australian pharmacy wholesalers.He recommended parents ask pharmacies to order the product in and if they had questions to contact the company directly.The a2 Milk Company did not respond to other requests for comment following the ABC's investigation into personal shoppers.
