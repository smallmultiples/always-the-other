Tania and Stuart Ablitt were Woolnorth kids, growing up on one of Tasmania's most iconic and unique properties, where they felt they were in a world all their own.They played on horseback, around the old jail and cook house, they fished and drove cars over the paddocks, to where islands and shipwrecks dotted the north-west tip of Tasmania.Both moved away individually for a few years, only to return as a young married couple to work as stockman and stockwoman.Today the Abletts still work on horseback at the huge beef property, Westmore near Arthur River, but like everyone in the region, they maintain an interest in what is happening next at Woolnorth.The Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) is currently reviewing the sale of the Van Diemens Land Company (VDL) — of which Woolnorth is the centrepiece — to Chinese billionaire Lu Xianfeng.Australian-owned Tasfoods and Tasmanian-based philanthropist Jan Cameron have also made formal offers. Current owners, New Zealand-based New Plymouth District Council, have accepted an offer of $280 million from Mr Xianfeng's Moon Lake Investments.The pending decision of the FIRB is the talk of the Circular Head area, but there has always been a lot of talk about Woolnorth.It is a stunning property that includes 34 kilometres of west coast shoreline and 18 kilometres on the north coast.Woolnorth is literally the north-west corner of Tasmania and in parts, sheep and cattle graze with spectacular, elevated views over water to numerous Bass Strait islands.VDL was formed in London in 1824 and operates under a Royal Charter and is believed to be the only charter company still operating on part of its original land grant.Across its 185-year history, if you did not work at Woolnorth, you were not likely to get much of a look at it.Locked gates reinforced the message and helped to protect the assets and stock of the vast property.Tania (nee Sharman) and Stuart Ablitt were both small children when they moved to Woolnorth with their parents, in the late 1960s and early 1970s respectively.Tania's father Hilton was a truck driver and machinery operator who also did a bit of stock work. "For me it was all about open spaces. If I wasn't at school or asleep, I was on my horse, out in the paddock; it was all worked with horses," Ms Ablitt recalled."As a kid, we all got on the bus and off we went to school. If we had floods or the road got too sandy we didn't make it to school."There was a little store there, so the groceries came in so you didn't need to leave, and we didn't leave that often."Ms Ablitt's family lived in the original cook's cottage at the Woolnorth homestead settlement, which was home to about eight families.Stockmen would work the sheep and beef cattle that were the property's staple, and Ms Ablitt remembers up to half a dozen kids on horseback tagging along.Mr Ablitt was not so smitten with horses as his wife when a young man.Among his most treasured memories of being a Woolnorth kid were driving old cars across the property to go fishing, aged about 12 or 14."We used to go fishing at the wreck of the Colliboi, off Woolnorth Point. Used to be a trading boat around the islands here but about '32, think it was, it hit a rock," Mr Ablitt said. "When I left in 1990, it was just the boiler left and half the frame buried in the sand [but] the fishing was always good. "Dad was a jack of all trades and mum used to do all the cooking for the fellas out there. The freedom was the thing! Magical is what it was."As she saddled her horse to move some heifers at Westmore, Ms Ablitt said the only regret of her Woolnorth childhood was not being allowed to play in the old jail, once used to house convicts.The couple each have memories of the dances that took place in the big shearing sheds, usually accompanied by a rodeo.For the wider Circular Head community, these were a great chance to get a look at the iconic property that was usually off limits.I wasn't going to wear no bloody gum boots and white apron for anyone. "They weren't really wild affairs like those outback dances they have," Mr Ablitt recalled."It was more just a laid-back country way, where people would catch up with old friends."Mr Ablitt became a shearer as a young man and moved away from Woolnorth's self-contained world.Then the girl who had hated the boy — who hated her back in school days — met him again as an adult, married him and they moved back to Woolnorth."That was in the 1980s and nearly everything was still done on horseback," Ms Ablitt said."At that time we were up around 52,000 sheep and 4,000 or 5,000 head of cattle."There wasn't much of Woolnorth we didn't get to see because once we got married we didn't go, like normal people, to town."You just stayed out there and went fishing and shooting and camping."  The Ablitts left Woolnorth before the VDL Company became part of the publicly listed New Zealand company, Tasman Agriculture, in 1993.The property has primarily had a dairy focus in the years since and although the controlling share has changed, it has remained a New Zealand-run company."I wasn't going to wear no bloody gum boots and white apron for anyone," Mr Ablitt said with a laugh, adding that working with beef cattle was a lifestyle choice.After so much of their lives at Woolnorth, the couple went to work on another large cattle property, Temma Farm, south of Arthur River.They recently moved to Westmore, between Arthur River and Marrawah.The Ablitts have not ridden their horses across Woolnorth for many years but are following the impending sale with interest.Like a lot of locals, they have mixed feelings about what should happen."Obviously we'd love to see Woolnorth owned by Tasmanians, or at least Australians," Ms Ablitt said."We can't make more land, so what we've got, we should keep."Having said that, if you have a property for sale and no-one wants to buy it except for maybe the Chinese, Americans or whatever, who are we to say that you can't sell that property?"
