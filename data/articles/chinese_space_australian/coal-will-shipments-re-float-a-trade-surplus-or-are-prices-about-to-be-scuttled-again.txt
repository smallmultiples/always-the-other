One of the more interesting observations out of the August trade figures is that the sudden rise in coal prices could soon wipe out Australia's chronic monthly deficits. "The massive spike in coal prices recently means export values will likely surge across September and October, which will narrow the trade deficit sharply further," UBS economist George Tharenou said.It is a theory complicated by the unclear relationship between spot, contract, and 'received' export prices, but it is thereabouts.A swing into a trade surplus would be quite a remarkable achievement given deficits have been racked up every month since the start of 2012, apart from a brief four-month export driven spurt two years ago."With coal exports around $2.8 billion per month — equivalent to a 10 per cent share of total exports — the price spike, if sustained over coming months, could potentially be large enough to wipe out the overall trade deficit by itself," Mr Tharenou wrote in a research note.That of course depends on things staying the way are.But things are almost certain not remain the way they are as Asian steel mills are decidedly unhappy about the doubling of spot hard coking — or metallurgical — coal prices in the past couple of months.So far supply has not responded to the price signal and met coal inventories at steel mills and ports are still at historically low levels. Poor weather in both Chinese and Australian coalfields has played its part in the recent spike and is unlikely to remain a factor for long.So while the price has taken off, producers have missed the boat so to speak, struggling with rail and mine interruptions as shipments fell by 1 per cent in August.In fact, export growth for met coal has been anaemic at best this year, up less than 1 per cent in the half year to July, a surprising result given the recent hype in the market.It also does not exactly support the idea the miners have been making a killing in the current supply shortage."So far the impact of these price increases has been muted — with only around one-third of global metallurgical trade occurring in spot markets," NAB's head of Australian commodities research Riki Polygenis noted.The bulk of met coal is sold at much lower prices on quarterly contracts.Current negotiations between Japan's Nippon Steel and the big miner Anglo American are struggling to find common ground on a new quarterly contract with the sellers looking for something north of $210 a tonne and the buyers arguing $160 a tonne is closer to fair value.But more significant moves are happening further north in China with the central planners at the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) deciding they have had enough of pricey coal.Earlier this month the NDRC loosened the production shackles on around 800 mines to give the economically more important steelmakers some relief.Extending mining operations as planned would see Chinese coal production increase more than 30 per cent, meaning an extra 60 million tonnes a year of metallurgical coal could hit the market."This was the first signal from the Chinese government that it wanted to cool the met coal market," Macquarie Wealth Management's commodity team wrote in a research note this week."The announcement came as a surprise considering that just one week prior a plea by steel mills for such action had been rejected, on the basis that the steel industry should be focused on reform and capacity closures."Up until the NDRC changed tack, Chinese coal policy had two aims; to cut pollution and to improve profitability of coal production through higher prices. China's move to fire up its coal production will have serious consequences for the ability of Australian miners to cash in on what may be a narrow window of opportunity."Increasing Chinese coal production and weaker steel output should put downward pressure on coal prices," Ms Polygenis said.It also gives regional steelmakers a stronger hand at the negotiating table, making it more difficult for a quick and lucrative settlement of fourth quarter pricing contracts for the miners."Negotiations have been tough going given the sharp price moves," the Macquarie team wrote."Japanese mills are wary of losing face if they commit to a quarterly price anywhere near spot and the market reverses, while there is also some uncertainty to the extent that such a large increase in raw materials costs could be passed through to steel customers.""There are also question marks around whether any settlement will be possible in these conditions, with some now calling the end of the quarterly contract system and a move to index pricing."BHP Billiton already sells the majority of its met coal outside of the quarterly contract system on shorter terms, so is less fussed than others about the outcome of the bi-annual Australia-Japan coal conference which is currently underway.Macquarie's commodities team argues renewed Chinese production won't fill the entire supply gap but it is clearly a meaningful addition, which will impact prices."From a Japanese mill perspective, continuing to wait it out in the negotiations or going to index might now be the preferred route," Macquarie said.Nonetheless the miners should enjoy some better times after the struggle for profitability in recent years.The question is how long will it last?The NAB commodities team has increased its forecast a fourth quarter price by 35 per cent to $US130 ($170) a tonne.But that may be about as good as gets as the NAB is expecting prices to come back below $US100 a tonne through next year.The Department of Industry, Innovation and Science has come up with a similar conclusion in its just published Resources and Energy Quarterly.The department's economists raised their forecast for met coal by 16 per cent to $99 a tonne through 2016-2017 on fairly flat volumes, which would boost export earnings by 35 per cent to $26 billion.
