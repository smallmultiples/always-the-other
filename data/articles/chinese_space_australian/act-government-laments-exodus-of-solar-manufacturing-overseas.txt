The ACT Government says it is "frustrating" Australian companies continue to miss out on opportunities in solar manufacturing, as the Territory takes another step towards meeting its 100 per cent renewable energy target.The comments came as the Territory Government marked the opening of a Chinese-funded solar farm on the outskirts of the ACT that will provide energy for 3,000 homes.The Mugga Lane Solar Park is owned by the self-described "Australian-Chinese company" Maoneng. Maoneng's major financiers are the Bank of China and the Chinese-state owned defence and aerospace company, AVIC.The ACT's Energy Minister and Greens MLA Shane Rattenbury defended the Government's decision to sell the land to Maoneng."Maoneng has made a significant contribution to the local economy, they bought the land from the ACT Government and they're continuing to feed development back into the Territory," he said."[But] it is frustrating that Australia has not been at the forefront of manufacture."We've done so much of the research...and we've seen the production go offshore, that is a frustrating thing."Australia has missed the boat, (the) big picture, when it comes to manufacturing solar."The head of Canberra-based solar installation company Solar Hub, Ben Masters, said most solar farms in Australia are either foreign-owned or partly foreign-owned."The companies that are actually capable of installing solar farms are the ones that are diversified internationally and are installing these in multiple countries," he said."For an Australian company to take the risk and get in that space - it's been too great a risk."Mr Masters said that was the "sad part" to an otherwise growing success story of solar technology in Australia."In some of our research institutions we're world leaders in the space of photovoltaics and even battery chemistry, but a lot of the commercialisation of these things...ends up happening overseas," he said."People haven't been willing in Australia to invest in these types of companies because the regulatory environment has been so inconsistent."While the majority of large-scale solar tech manufacturing occurs overseas, Ben Masters said there are still Australian companies willing to compete. "It's not over yet. There are companies in Australia, for example, who are looking at making zinc-bromide batteries, flow batteries," he said."Those sort of technologies have some legs and should be supported by the Government."He also pointed out Australia's success in the software aspect of solar technology."Maybe our place is to actually provide the innovation in that software space, where we're controlling the sort of market interaction of renewables," he said."Maybe that is a place where we can actually create some amazing companies that are based in Australia, employing Australian people and pouring that money back into the Australian economy."The ACT Government also marked the installation of the 100th solar battery storage system under its scheme to help discount the costs of solar electricity for consumers.The 'Next Generation' renewables energy storage grant aims to subsidise 5,000 homes and businesses connecting to solar by 2020 and save more than $60 million in network costs.Homeowners David and Lainie Shorthouse were two of the first customers to get involved."We're a bit peculiar. We're what they call 'early adopters'," Mr Shorthouse said.In December the Shorthouses installed twenty panels and a storage battery â€” which meant during last month's heatwave, they actually made money contributing energy back into the grid."We might have to downsize in five or seven years' time, but the point is we've made the house more sustainable, and hopefully there will be people who are interested in that," Mr Shorthouse said.
