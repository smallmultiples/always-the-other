A large field of Liberal hopefuls have put their hand up to replace outspoken federal backbencher Julia Banks in the suburban Melbourne seat of Chisholm. At a time when the Liberal Party is grappling with how to boost female representation from its ranks, only two of the nine nominees are women.Ms Banks sensationally announced she would not contest the next election because of the behaviour of her colleagues in the wake of the Liberal leadership spill that ended Malcolm Turnbull's prime ministership.Her comments about bullying reignited debate about women in the Liberal Party, with a renewed push from some quarters for the party to introduce a quota system to boost female representation. Gladys Liu, already preselected for an Upper House spot at November's Victorian election, is one of two female candidates for Chisholm and is understood to having the backing of Victorian Liberal Party state president Michael Kroger.Other contenders include Theo Zographos, Blair Barker and Andrew Davenport, who are local councillors with the Monash and Whitehorse councils.One senior source said the party was aware of the pressure to recruit more women into public office but also warned that "anything" could happen in local preselections.Former Victorian Liberal Senator Judith Troeth has been an advocate for more women in the party and has backed the idea of a woman replacing Ms Banks."We don't need to lose any women," she said.She said there were still no signs of constitutional or organisational changes to the Liberal Party being made in order to encourage more women into parliament."Until that happens it is all talk and no walk,'' Ms Troeth said.Liberal sources said that the preselection battle will be between Ms Liu, Cr Davenport and Cr Zographos.Labor candidate Jennifer Yang has already begun campaigning in the seat.The seat was the only electorate that the Liberals won from Labor at the 2016 election and a redistribution of boundaries means that the Coalition holds the seat by 3.4 per cent.Chisholm has a large Chinese-Australian population and some Liberal strategists see the extra value of Ms Liu's heritage.One candidate, Peter Bain, stood as a candidate in previous federal elections for the Family First Party.
