Prime Minister Tony Abbott praised Chinese president Xi Jinping on his commitment to greater democracy, as both leaders celebrated the finalisation of talks on a free trade agreement.Mr Xi was honoured with a dinner in the great hall of Parliament House on Monday night, attended by politicians, business, cultural, and industry leaders.In his earlier parliamentary address, Mr Xi sent a clear message to the world that China is "the big guy in the crowd" of Asia, but a peaceful one who has no desire to plunge into conflicts or war."We have set two goals for Chinaâ€™s future development," he said."The first is to double the 2010 GDP and per-capita income of urban and rural residents and build a society of initial prosperity in all respects by 2020."The second is to turn China into a modern socialist country that is prosperous, democratic, culturally advanced and harmonious by the middle of the century."As Mr Abbott proposed a toast to the Chinese leader, he emphasised Mr Xi's second point."I have never heard a Chinese leader declare that his country will be fully democratic by 2050," Mr Abbott said. "I have never heard a Chinese leader commit so explicitly to a rule-based international order founded on the principle that we should all treat others as we would be treated ourselves."When the moment comes, China meets it and masters it. When leadership is there, China is there... this is the story of modern China. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten was also impressed by China's emergence as a regional and world leader."Because we know that when China sets a goal, you achieve it. When opportunity knocks, China opens the door," Mr Shorten said."When the moment comes, China meets it and masters it. When leadership is there, China is there - the best qualified to offer it."This is the story of modern China."But Greens leader Christine Milne was not as quick to celebrate the Chinese president's leadership.In a letter Ms Milne handed to Mr Xi after his parliamentary speech, she raised concerns about human rights, the protest movement in Hong Kong, and political prisoners."I request that you release from prison, Dr Liu Xiaobo, the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who was sentenced for his role in drafting and co-signing a peaceful statement appealing for political reform, which was signed by tens of thousands of people. I also request that you release his wife, Liu Xia, from house arrest," Ms Milne wrote.However, Ms Milne also commended Mr Xi for his action on climate change.President Xi told the dinner guests he would keep working to deepen the "political trust" between Australia and China."I have a full confidence in the future of our comprehensive strategic partnership," he said through a translator."At the new starting point, our two sides need to work together to translate the outcomes of the visit to reality, and I'm sure we can achieve that objective."The free trade agreement (FTA) is not expected to come into effect until well into next year and many of the finer details are still unknown.We've got to actually make [Chinese visitors] feel welcome by having a visa situation that is easy for them to navigate, at a reasonable price. The implications for labour markets will be heavily scrutinised, but it is a different type of people movement that has the tourism industry concerned.The FTA includes greater investment opportunities for both Australian and Chinese tourism companies, but Tourism and Transport Forum (TTF) chief executive officer Margy Osmond said that would not matter if the Government did not make it easier for Chinese visitors to get a visa."If we're going to meet the visitor numbers, we've got to actually make them feel welcome by having a visa situation that is easy for them to navigate, at a reasonable price," Ms Osmond said.She said Australia was losing out on the Chinese market to the US and Canada."Your average Chinese visitor has to fill in a 15-page form, in English, submit it manually and then wait at least 15 days for a visa, and pay $130 for the privilege," she said.Ms Osmond said while the FTA was a good breakthrough, it could have been much better.
