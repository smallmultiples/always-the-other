Tighter economic integration with China should not be a reason to delude oneself about the nature of a regime that is profoundly adverse to democracy, writes Nicholas Bequelin.Is the Australian Government trying to manufacture a false sense of security among the public about what increasing reliance on China really means for the country's future?It's hard to see what else could have led Prime Minister Tony Abbott to publicly declare his elation at the prospect at China becoming "fully democratic by 2050" during an effusive state dinner last month.The reality is that the Chinese Communist Party - which has shed communist ideals but not its Leninist organisational principles and insistence on one-party rule - has no intention to embrace democracy, now or later. In fact, what the Party states unequivocally is that one-party dictatorship is both "more suited" to the Chinese people and superior to democracy.This is not to say that Chinese people - as opposed to their autocratic leaders - don't want a democratic and accountable government under the rule of law. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, for instance, was a long-standing advocate of the democratisation of China. The appeal of his ideas among many is precisely why he is serving an 11-year sentence in a remote prison. Even more modest reformers, such as legal advocate Xu Zhiyong, who put forward the idea that citizens should lead China's transition towards genuine rule of law, inevitably end up behind bars.Hundreds of other political prisoners can attest to the Party's deep antipathy to the idea of external checks and balances, not to mention sharing power in any way or form.In fact, if Tony Abbott hadn't been so giddy about the Free Trade Agreement with China, he might have noticed that President Xi had said in his speech to the Parliament that China remains committed to the socialist path: code for continued one-party dictatorship.But being delusional about China seems to be a bipartisan condition. At President Xi's address to Australian Parliament, Australia's Labor Opposition Leader, Bill Shorten, said: We all take heart from the fact that decades of economic growth and trade liberalisation have encouraged the real and important advancement of human rights, political freedoms and the rule of law and long may that continue.The truth is that China is in the midst of one of the harshest crackdowns on critics and rights activists witnessed in years, not to mention active and overt political censorship of media and internet content, persecution of religious believers who refuse to join state-controlled churches, large-scale forced-evictions to make way for infrastructure projects, and repression of ethnic Tibetans in Tibet and Uighurs in Xinjiang.Chinese leaders have also taken a hard line on democratic aspirations in Hong Kong, reneging on China's formal promise to introduce universal suffrage for the election of the chief executive.And while there are many unknowns about the Chinese economy, the extent of corruption, hidden protectionism, absence of real financial markets, lack of independent courts, systemic corruption, and rampant theft of intellectual property are not among them.So how can we account for comments that are so far off the mark, about a country to which Australia's economic future is so closely linked?One may wish it was another case of commercial interests speaking, but in reality the problem goes much deeper: after years of finding justifications for not taking up human rights issues publicly with China, the Australian Government has ended up believing its own - and China's - propaganda about "the human rights situation improving overall", "encouraging signs", and, above all, that "human rights matters are best raised in private meetings".The bilateral "human rights dialogue" between Australia and China is how these issues are disposed of; a sporadic, behind closed doors meeting in which nothing of substance is discussed, and whose main function is to quarantine human rights issues from regular and high-level diplomatic relations. Abbott has acknowledged this himself, stating that "these human rights matters are matters for the human rights dialogue. They are not normally matters for discussion between Prime Ministers and Premiers or between Prime Ministers and Presidents."So far the main result of the dialogue seems to have been that Australia is now parroting China's position on a wide-range of human rights issues, while China doesn't seem have ever conceded anything, and actually keeps detaining Australian citizens of Chinese origin embroiled in business disputes on the mainland.Yet in what must have felt like an unprecedented act of courage, Canberra expressed publicly earlier this year "concerns" about the arrest of Pu Zhiqiang, a prominent Beijing lawyer with a record of handling politically sensitive cases who is facing imminent trial. A few months later, China agreed to the Free Trade Agreement, proof that when Australian leaders can find their voices, the sky doesn't fall.Tighter economic integration with China should not be a reason to delude oneself - and the country - about the nature of a regime that is profoundly adverse to democracy, at home and abroad. Instead, it should be an opportunity for the Australian government to speak clearly and consistently on human rights.Nicholas Bequelin is senior researcher in the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch, based in Hong Kong.

Alert moderator
02 Dec 2014 12:35:30amWe have so many people telling us how wonderful democracy is that we have started believing that it is actually true. Democracy is so heavily promoted by the vested interests only because it can be easily manipulated by the same vested interests to get a government which will support their vested interest. One day in three years we all have equal say - one vote. However, for the remaining one thousand one hundred and ninety five days our elected governments do as told by the active and organised groups such as academia, media, unions and business. That is what we call democracy.In actual fact democracy brings everything and everyone to the lowest common denominator. How else can you explain people of the 'calibre' of Jackie Lambie, Ricky Muir or Clive Palmer deciding the future of the country. It is important to point out that whenever a positive result needs to be achieved democracy is not even considered. There is no democracy in the army. No business can contemplate achieving results by entertaining democracy. It requires a structure and hierarchy to streamline resources for positive outcome. That is why the structured and focused Chinese government will always be far more 'efficient' than any democracy.  Democracy is a form of political system where the mediocre people get elected to form a government to entertain mediocre public and do as they are told by the vested interests.

Alert moderator
02 Dec 2014 8:19:37amTina, I offer this food for thought: when the ability to decide is straightforward and unimpeded by "democratic niceties", the decisions are certainly quick.... but they are also more likely to be wrong. Why? Because a unilateral decision that does not contemplate constructive feedback is unable to improve itself before it is applied. Improvement may only come upon implementing it and then realising the disaster that it is. But wait, there is more, when the regime is authoritarian (not democratic) you may even find yourself in the situation where the arbitrary decision of the dictator is wrong, as clearly shown by the actual results, but he (it's usually "he") will insist to carry on no matter what, being protected by those supporting his power (usually the military).No, Democracy may be imperfect but it remains the best system we have.

01 Dec 2014 6:03:19pmAgree with Christian, Australia and much of the West and the writer of this article are selective in attacking human rights and so-called democratic freedom. Reality is when our own skin are threatened we threw democratic and human rights out the window. We don't even want to let too many people from desperate war torn countries in and yet we criticise how government manage problems of  gigantic populace. We & US supported , and still do many Middle east despots because they were"friends" and then deserted them in sinking ship when it's no longer profitable for us. Such hypocrisy defies human decency let alone  human rights.

02 Dec 2014 1:23:55pmCan not agree more. Both of  democracy and human rights are just tool to achieve our goals. I will not say China and US which one is better. It is true that Chinese people has less right to decide the future of their own country. If they have, China will be better? Hard to say. Too many countries with named democracy government did nothing to improve people's life. More and more Chinese believe they will have better future, even far from what we have. That's why PRC still there, more and more confident and powerful.

The CCP is a ruthless organisation whose only aim is to remain in power and the small cadre of men that run it will ultimately take any action they decree necessary to ensure that remains the case. The whole point of their entry into the World Trade Organisation was for it to lead to greater economic growth alongside increasing democracy and political freedom. We've exported the jobs of tens of thousands of people, from Australia, North America and Europe, in return for stuff all political advance. When their growth stops - and the property market, with thousands of apartment blocks empty across Eastern cities, is poised for a massive correction - they  will not hesitate to distract the Chinese people by engineering a military conflict with Japan, Taiwan or Vietnam (again). The Chinese government only responds to strength and the western allies, desperate for a politically manipulated export market, are divided and weak.

Like me, all he can do is guess.History is on the side of Chinese democracy, but it will be a slow and painful process. The progress of Taiwan, another predominantly Chinese country, is a bell weather indication of what may ensue in China. Taiwan had it's first fully democratic election in 1996 and I have watched the evolution of the democratic porocess since then. Saturday's local government elections were a clear indicator of just how far Taiwan has come and the future is looking better all the time. To be sure, Taiwan has a long way to go yet, the rule of law is still embrionic but the conduct of the latest elections is a far cry from anything that has proceded it.Now let's see where China is going on this.

01 Dec 2014 4:30:28pmWhile there is no doubt that there is room for improvement with the Chinese government , on the whole they have done a reasonable job ,far better than the succession of clowns who have run this country sinceWW2 . People in China are better protected against violent criminals than Australians because the Chinese government stands up for its people and executes criminals where as in Australia violent criminals often receive very light sentences , also it is not true that Australia can be called a democracy when the high court can often act as an unaccountable law unto its self and often makes rulings that are not beneficial to the Australian people

01 Dec 2014 5:20:46pmOK. Just to sum up your arguments.Totalitarianism is a reasonable way to get things done. Because:-Democracy is just rule by 'clowns'.-Executing people is a better outcome for justice.-Totalitarian governments are better at protecting their citizens.-Democracy does not mean better justice outcomes.-Appealate Courts obstruct justice.The same government machine-gunned its citizens and crushed them under tanks in 1989. Can you demonstrate how that was a better, safer outcome for anyone?

02 Dec 2014 1:56:52pmAustralia send troops to Vietnam to support the US ground forces in Nam. This was not an 'invasion'*, as both armies were there at the behest of the South Vietnamese government. We went not due to a direct threat of an attack on Australian soil, but due to the treaty we have with the USA.Australia did not have conscription at the outset of the war, but ended up sending about a quarter of those troops as conscripts. Some of them died or were wounded. It was the fourth time that Australia had conscription and used those troops in foreign wars. That has no relevence to the points you were articulating earlier. At that time the PRC was not officially recognised as the legitimate government of China, that was considered to be the former ROC government (now Taiwan) until 1971. So, effectively in the 1960's, 'China' was on the side of the West's war on Vietnam.*The PRC did invade Vietnam in 1979 in the short-lived Third Indochina War

02 Dec 2014 12:17:56pmThe great thing about executing criminals is that your can sell their organs and make a great deal of money.The great thing about being a nation run by corrupt dictators is that they can deem folks to be criminals for the most dubious of reasons and without any real due process or protections for the population (particularly if they like your organs and/or blood type).The systematic execution of Falun Gong members (as one example) and the extraction of their organs (on demand) is however not something that has been concealed from the world (much to the disappointment of the dictatorship of china).ps. the high court (Judiciary) is there to interpret the law, the legislative assembly is there to write the law, the executive (ie. the police) is there to enforce the law. By separating the powers of government you protect the population from the abuse of power. The Chinese should try it some day. I can recommend it.

01 Dec 2014 4:48:06pmThere is a major delusion that most people in Australia have. Two really. The first delusion is that all other countries should want to embrace our "democracy". Seriously? Think about it for 2 milliseconds. Why should any other country want to have a system of government that gives us the Abbott government, the Rudd governments, the last NSW labour government, etc. etc. etc. Why would they want a "democracy" that shows disdain for global problems like climate change? China quite rightly won't have a bar of our nonsense. They can't, they have 1.3 billion mouths to feed.The second delusion and its not nearly so obvious is that we don't really have an effective democracy anyway. Our party system leads to pre-selection of electoral candidates by very small, non-representative groups aligned to vested interests. For years now in my electorate I haven't been able to vote for anyone I think is worth voting for. I can't even obtain objective information about the candidates without a moderate amount of my own research.

01 Dec 2014 5:13:05pmSo Nicholas Bequelin is senior researcher in the "Asia Division of Human Rights Watch, based in Hong Kong". Any chance of setting up an office based in Syria? Or Libya? Or Iraq? Or Afghanistan?Take Syria for example, the Human Rights Watch hombres told us that Syria is in need of democracy big time. As if we don't already knew, that human rights is lacking there as well. So there came the "Arab Spring" brigades with the blessing of Human Rights Watch groups. What happened to Syria now?No, I don't support dictatorship, nor do I condone tortures. However, I am a realist. I know the world is never going to be perfect because God, if there is one, never did take the time to properly design one. So we have a situation where you have a functioning society where people can still go about their daily business, with a roof over their heads, and decent meals for themselves and their children, but no democracy.But no, that wasn't good enough. They needed human rights and democracy. Yes, such things do exist  for those who agitators in the Western world. Unfortunately, the poor folks in those war-torn countries now are living in abject poverty, on some one else' land, as refugees. When and if they are able to return will never be known.So please think about the consequences before you go about trying to "democratize" everybody !

So China is allowed to rule Tibet by all of us. If you disagree, protest to Julie Bishop as soon as possible to save your integrity.As for persecution, it is that Chinese government has been bribing the Tibetans with free cars and vehicles, houses, infrastructures,medicare, etc. but failed to win their loyalty so far due to strong resistance from religious elite.

02 Dec 2014 10:15:12amExcept it wasn't de jure independent. Only Mongolia recognised it as independent. Major powers at the time including the United States recognised it was part of China. In the US case they even put it in their WWII propaganda videos describing China and the need to commit US troops to help fight Japan in China. It was only when the Chinese lead Guomindang/Kuomintang (depending on which Romanisation you use) lost to the Chinese Communist Party in the civil war, then this recognition was downplayed and Tibet was then described as an independent country. As opposed to a region which was not under the control of the central government (like numerous provinces at the time) because they were fighting a civil war, and fighting Japan at the same time.

Is China a country where the law rules? Partly. It's improving. Is there corruption in China? Yes. Is there corruption in Australia? Yes. Is the level of corruption comparable?

01 Dec 2014 11:18:06pmConcept of a democracy is an interesting one and comes in many forms. Here in Australia we practise Westminster System of Government, the United States practises a Republic System with 2 tiers of Governance consisting of their President with Executive Powers and the 2 Houses of Congress who can override the President if they have the voting numbers; neither Government system can be deemed ancient Greek style of Democracy.No Government system is perfect as every Country has its own unique blend of culture, history, traditions, population density, language mix, social racial religious tensions, internal external pressures facing the Country; there is no "one size fits all" form of Government.  What does matter is that the people are allowed to feel that they have some measure of control over their lives despite what prevailing Society rules (Laws) are in place, and that their "Government" is actively taking steps to improve their living educational and "happiness"  standards.Given recent events, two points to consider: 1 - Had the Euromaidian protesters been magically transported from Kyiv Ukraine to downtown New York City, and the Hong Kong protestors been magically transported to downtown Los Angeles, then the question to ask is how long would the protests have been allowed to continue before the American Authorities forcibly ended the protests occurring on their own turf?2 - The social "netizen" phenomena where the people have influenced events and have caused the Central Government to respond appears unique to China.  The speed of communication interaction and ability to share information commentary opinion, and willingness of the Chinese people to use smart phone internet technology is an example of democracy "Chinese style" at work.  Can any other Country lay claim to having its own "netizens"?   The surprising thing is that the Chinese Government allows it.Sadly, these days you have to be sceptical when reading articles in the media - what is the purpose of the article? Is it to be informative factual? Is it to be sensationalistic?   Is it to be deceptive by seemingly being informative but fails to reveal "inconvenient truth"?

Compared to us, with an idiot in charge of a sinking ship, I envy China. The sad thing is to look around the world and see just how many corrupt, oppressive and self serving short sighted democracies in the world ... and you will understand that waving the flag saying "democracy" as though that answers all the questions is contrary to reality.As for human rights - there is a large difference between words and deeds.

01 Dec 2014 10:31:34pmI too am a proud Australian living and working in China. I'm also the son of a WWII veteran of who's father's battalion, China were allies of during WWII. It is easy to see the posters on this forum that don't have first hand knowledge of China, or a good understanding of our history of war, with their comments that they would rather be friends of America who were our allies during WWII. Lest we forget the Japanese who were a common enemy of the US, Australia and China but are now on the favoured list. My work is based in Xinjiang which is where I live and I have had good first hand experience with the local minority ethnic groups as well as the Han and Hui. I haven't seen anything in the way of suppression here but I have seen some sensible controls in place. I feel safer walking the streets here at night than I do in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne. There is very little street crime, and for my years here I haven't come across any juvenile problems, as the children are all too busy being schooled and taken care of by responsible parents. There will be those that say I see things differently as I am a foreigner here but I also have a Chinese family and many friends from various ethnic groups including Uighur and Hazak, so I get a view from a broad perspective. It is a shame that the ABC chooses to engage authors who have an obvious 'anti China' agenda to push, as is the case with this article. This article is selective and biased with the authors own opinion, who obviously has no regard for writing a balanced analysis piece or who's first hand experience in China is either limited, or tainted by a predetermined opinion. I have to wonder why the ABC leans towards 'Anti China' articles, it seems to be the norm for them. I really don't think I've seen a positive article about China on the ABC other than in the business section. In saying that, there are problems here, as there are with every other country in the world, but China is moving forward and tackling those problems, and with a country as large as China is in population, physical size and history they have made huge ground and are continuing to advance daily. As for human rights issues I don't think the Australian government is in any position to be critical of other countries given their own miserable management of the current refugee problems, not to mention their own very poor attempts at sorting the problems with the Australian Indigenous people. There appears to be a fear of China rising, being driven by the US. I believe that fear is driven by the US losing their position of dominance. In 1980 there were 600 million people living in poverty in China. The CPC has pledged that by 2017 that number will be zero. I think Zero will be unachievable but if they can get the number down to the same as Australia, they will have done a fantastic job.

02 Dec 2014 12:37:40pmWhile it is true to say that the level of poverty in china has fallen dramatically over the last few decades due to the fact that it has experienced enormous economic growth one still has to wonder whether the level of poverty would be much less if the nation was actually free and not subject to the massive corruption, waste and nepotism that is inherent with any authoritarian regime (as found in China).Perhaps it should be said the Chinese people have improved wealth despite the activities of the Chinese Communist Party, not because of it.ps. how much do blinkers cost in China? are they supplied for free in Xinjiang? can you go to a Falun Gong meeting openly, and without fearing for the safety of your organs?

02 Dec 2014 2:07:25pmJoe Bloggs,I have always enjoyed your many delightful posts because they made sense. However, I beg to differ on this one.About poverty...You reckon that China would reduce its poverty levels in leaps and bounce if "... if the nation was actually free and not subject to the massive corruption..."Well, the flag carrier of democracy and human right, namely the USA, despite the fact that it is the largest economy, there are more folks sleep in their cars, under the bridges, and even in caves. Just because you are employed does not meant you are doing well. The WalMart employees is a case in point, when they need to rely on food-stamps. Corruptions? Well, I bet you are aware of the GFC? That was the mother of all corruptions on a grand scale. Yes, bankers and insurance brokers were the front-men, but I have a deep suspicion that some of the law makers/rulers could have done rather well out of the scam, before the crash !No one, no mater how industrious or clever and tricky, can make any advance in living standards without a secure, stable environment. It so happen that it is a Communist party. So what? Look at Africa, many people are still living in conditions we used to endure 100 years ago. Why? Bad governance. To dismiss a particular type of governing system just because it is different to the one you preferred, and is familiar with, is a "blinkered" opinion.

02 Dec 2014 2:40:50pmFred.It has been proposed that a levy/duty be applied to any product coming out of a nation that has a poor human rights record to reduce demand for the product (by making it more expensive comparably), thus by improving their human rights record they would reduce (or get rid of) the levy thus allowing them to make more money. A financial incentive of sorts.Similar proposals exist to help ensure environmental protections exist in other countries to help benefit the population (ie. suffering from the effects of pollutants and industrial waste).The secondary upside to this is that it will level the global playing field as first world nations already must meet minimum standards for human rights, workers rights and environmental protections.

02 Dec 2014 5:02:57amWell said Dean! The vast preponderance of "informed" commentators pontificating on current affairs with little or no knowledge of the historical background of those affairs leaves one in a state of smouldering despair. Their information can be traced as originating from the first newspaper they bought or from TV documentaries. Prior to that they are a blank slate.Tibet was not a "free" country prior to 1949. Actually, China moved armed forces and civil administration into that country in 1953. Tibet had been a repressive religious oligarchy for centuries with powerful militant Buddhist monasteries exercising authority of life and death over vast tracts of farming land worked by serf-farmers. China had been a suzerain on and off for centuries as had other empires of central Asia that came and went. It has been a "buffer state" between east and west for millennia. As for Chinese history, it would require too much space to provide a cogent argument for a one party state being commensurate with much of that nation's social and philosophical development during approximately 8,000 years of civilisation. The ebb and flow of dynastic and regime changes over that period and their varying levels of sophistication have no close parallels with other national histories.

If anything, I would have thought Sinophiles would be all out not mentioning that episode.The one big positive I can see for the world is that the Chinese invasion dispersed the wisdom of Tibet, in the form of highly attained Buddhist practitioners, to the West. Massive bonus for the materialists of the West, especially in the US. Welcome Dalai Lama, Trungpa Rinpoche, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Dzongsar Khyenstse Rinpoche, Karma Thinley Rinpoche and Sogyal Rinpoche, author of 'The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying' - a must have for all hospitals and nursing homes.

02 Dec 2014 8:07:24amI don't know that many countries measure up against the basic principles of democracy.  Is a two party state really that much better than a one party state? From what I can see China is averse not to democracy but corrupt democracy where a minority manipulates the system to ensure leadership stays in the hands of a small select group of like minded people and in some cases closely related people. The Chinese leadership regularly changes through a process that can be seen as democratic. Sure the process is designed to keep out the influence of private corporations. There may be more good than harm in that. On Human rights, are an issue all over the world. We should take a good hard look in the mirror and fix our issues at home and with our close friends so that when we approach China on the issue we can be confident we are standing on firm ground.

02 Dec 2014 12:09:49pmCome on, by now you surely know that money is the most important thing to politicians? Don't worry about what is happening in Hong Kong or China's expanding Navy manoeuvres in the disputed territories, their support for North Korea or their artificial manipulation of their currency to give them unfair advantage over other countries. As long as we can make money no body cares. We have all been fed LIES about "free trade". There is no such thing. Only Australian politicians selling out our local manufacturers to please the Chinese.

02 Dec 2014 12:17:51pmThe Chinese regime is not only against democracy, it is against anything good and anything spiritual.  It commits the most heinous crimes, while our western politicians pretend not to notice it so much and putting economic pursuits above all else.  It is due to this attitude of our politicians - that we choose - that the evil regime can get away with murder.  We should not be selling our souls for economic benefit Mr Abott.

02 Dec 2014 1:14:54pmThe Chinese Communist Party is indeed a despotic and murderous regime. Just take a look at how they are still persecuting large amounts of their own people for the littlest thing. Behind the grand facade of so called glorious economic progress lies the sweat, tears and blood of the hard working Chinese people. The regime only cares about itself, certainly not the people. And then there's the horrendous and brutal persecution of the peaceful Falun Gong adherents. Behind closed doors tens of thousands of them are being tortured and even having their organs removed and sold while still alive for just doing meditation. And this is not the mafia or triads doing this to them, it is systematically organized by the regime itself. Take a look at what's really going on and you'll clearly see what an ice cold and murderous regime this is. Don't be fooled by the nice and shiny facade. Behind the wall is a communist dictatorship that is thirsty for power and control. The Chinese regime has killed over 80 million of its own people since it came to power in 1949. That's more than both world wars together. Do you think they will stop killing just like that? It's one of their main strategies for keeping the fear strong amongst the people so people keep quite and don't stand up.

02 Dec 2014 1:22:21pmHas the Chinese leadership denied the African reports that ivory was smuggled out for their president in diplomatic bags? If true it is utterly shameful and disgusting. Asian demand for elephant and rhino horn is leading to the extinction of these wonderful animals. Did any of Abbott's cronies speak out for these defenceless animals in their FTA negotiations?

02 Dec 2014 4:02:37pmThe Western World should apologise for the role they played in the slavery of Human beings and in the near extinction of animals in Africa.In the second half of the 19th century, the northern border of Central Africa was suddenly opened up to the impact of an intense new trade in ivory. Rapid prosperity in both Europe and North America had led to an increase in demand for ivory to make piano keys, billiard balls, knife handles, and ornamental carvings.Violence in Leopold II's Congo Free State was incomparable to that of any other states during the time period (1880s). Leopold II of Belgium (1865-1909) played a key role in the European colonization by conquering areas along the Congo River. He also lied to the other leader of Europe by telling them that he would promote "Commerce, Christianity, and Civilization" to his Congo state. However, African labourers not only suffered from long, hard work in the sun, but faced the most brutal violence than any other state. Instead of promoting Christianity and Civilization as he promised to do, European companies in Leopold II's Congo Free State introduced slavery, ruthless savagery, and terror. Leopold II did not allow missionaries to enter the colony in fear that they would report the horrors they saw there to Europe.Europe definitely should not have tried to conquer and colonize Africa. The land already belonged to people that inhabited the area for centuries, but yet the Europeans were blinded by power and opulence. And yes, it does bring economic benefits, but at the cost of human morality.

02 Dec 2014 3:31:34pmI frequently wonder how much effect we have on China (and other countries) by raising human rights issues and issues about democracy. It brings to mind the biblical quotation: "Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?" I'm certain China pays no attention to our rantings. They'd just see us as hypocrites. You could imagine the President asking Abbott about how the aboriginies are. Further still, the west refers to democracy as if it is a holy grail - it isn't. Democracies are just as proned to corruption as autocracies and democracies can be just as unrepresentative as dictatorships. I think the bigger question each and every government around the world should be asking is: Are we here for ourselves or for the people? A self serving democratic government is no better than a dictatorship. On the other hand, a dictatorship where the dictator actively tries to better the lives of his/her people could be argued to be just as good.

02 Dec 2014 3:44:18pmThe chinese regime is a murderous entity . How could we continue trade with them? That is like asking Hitler to come to our country our parliament. Shame Shame Shame on you Tony Abbott and all those who did not have the strength and righteousness to stand up to these murderers. This regime has already murdered 80 million from Mao and now this current regime is murdering Falun Gong for their organs for money that goes to the military. Millions have died for living by truthfulness, compassion , and Forbearance. There is no excuse , you sought power and money  and you thought you were being worldly. But you showed me that the Australian Parliament puts money and trade before the atrocities of the Live forced forced organ harvesting on Falun Gong who have their organs taken out of them while still alive and sold to rich aged westerners.. THis world has gone mad.. and because you did nothing i fear for your future. Are you in parliament  to father our nation or destroy our nation.?

Now her  face is westernised  and she hugs Koalas in our Australian parliament . Do you really know who these people are?  The facade and fakery is sickening. You will the first PM to bring Australia into a war of which you can do nothing about.

02 Dec 2014 4:14:10pmEver since the US and Australia recognised China, it has always been about the 'ECONOMY' and nothing to do with human rights or democracy.  That was established decades ago!  Everyone s fully aware that China is a Communist country just like Vietnam and the West has been trading with a number of Communist countries for their benefit for decades!What does "fully democratic" mean by the way?  There are many democracies that just barely make it through the definition of democracy, of a genuine democratic process, not simply a facade or skeleton of what democracy should be.  anytime any of these articles speak of democracy they are very loose about its definitions and loose on specifics as there are many 'types'.1. A genuine People's Referendum for the electorate to decide the direction of a country2. A 'Recall system' to thrown out the corrupt politicians and those who do not truly'Represent their respective electorate' by vote3. A ''Direct Democracy' is missing from Australia and we have a 'Representative Democracy.     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_democracy4. A Intra-party democracy is what mostly resembles the Chinese Communist Party which is a right to take part of the decision making of the party, usually within a single-party state government. 5. Australia has a 'Parliamentary democracy'The US has a 'Presidential Democracy' but it can hardly be called a democracy as it has morphed into a 'Rogue nation-state' marauding and invading and occupying other countries for its Imperial world-wide hegemony.  It has a Constitution and a Bill of Rights yet it is ignored.  It is a signatory of the UN yet it acts in defiance of the world concerning the rule of law.These article constantly attack and criticise China, yet ignore the actions of the US ever since 9/11.  Australia does not have a good reputation on human rights either, so before you start to throw stones please examine your own country's situation.  Australians are also deluded about its own country and the actions of the Federal Government.
