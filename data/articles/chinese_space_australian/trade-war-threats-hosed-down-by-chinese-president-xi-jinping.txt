US stock futures rallied, Asian shares bounced and the safe haven yen fell as Chinese President Xi Jinping promised to lower import tariffs on products, including cars, helping soothe investor jitters over an escalating US-China trade row.Mr Xi, speaking at the Boao Forum for Asia in Hainan province, said China would take measures to dramatically widen market access for foreign investors, raise the foreign ownership limit in the automobile sector and protect the intellectual property of foreign firms.US President Donald Trump took to Twitter to welcome the "kind words" from China's leader. The Chinese President's comments prompted a rapid and largely positive reaction from investors, who have been rattled over the past week on fears the tit-for-tat US-China tariffs will explode into a full-scale trade war that would deal a blow to global growth."His comments seem to have covered all the major issues the US has raised, including intellectual properties and liberalisation of domestic markets," said Yoshinori Shigemi, the global market strategist for JPMorgan Asset Management in Tokyo."Xi threw the ball into the US court but it appears China is laying the groundwork to achieve an agreement with the US."On stock markets, US S&P 500 E-mini futures rose by as much as 1.5 per cent and were last up 1 per cent. The MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan recovered from early losses and advanced 0.7 per cent.Australia's benchmark ASX 200 index had climbed 0.8 per cent to 5,856 shortly before the close of trade.Japan's Nikkei share average climbed 1.1 per cent, led by a sharp jump in the transportation sector.Toyota and Honda, which have operations in China, rallied 1.9 per cent and 2.1 per cent respectively."By and large it appears that the speech is more conciliatory than it is pugilistic with respect to how their approach to the US is," said Vishnu Varathan, the head of economics and strategy for Mizuho Bank in Singapore."At the end of the day the sense is that the political incentives will be for both parties to get to the negotiation table."As risk sentiment improved, safe haven currencies and assets retreated.US 10-year treasury bonds fell, pushing their yields up 2 basis points to 2.805 per cent. Gold eased about 0.2 per cent.The safe-haven yen fell broadly, leading the Australian dollar to climb 0.8 per cent to a three-week high of 82.94 yen.Against the US dollar, the Australian dollar gained 0.4 per cent to $0.7729."President Xi has ignited a rally in risk assets that might have some legs if the US can keep a lid on the protectionist rhetoric for a while," said Sean Callow, a currency strategist for Westpac in Sydney.Reuters
