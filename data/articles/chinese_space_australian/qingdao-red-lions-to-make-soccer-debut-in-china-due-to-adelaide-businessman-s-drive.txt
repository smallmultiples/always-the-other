Its highest paid player earns about 70 times what a top player in Australia might earn and there are at least five times the number of professional clubs, but one Australian thinks he can conquer Chinese club soccer and challenge for the Super League title.Adelaide-based businessman Bruno Marveggio is part of a three-man ownership group which has started the Qingdao Red Lions club in the fourth tier of Chinese soccer.Astute in his dealings, Marveggio has been planning the Red Lions and an associated academy for about three years, partnering with two Dutchmen to officially form the club two months ago.The club will play its first match when the League Three season kicks off on May 21, but Marveggio has an ambitious plan to have it playing in the top-tier Super League within five years.The father-of-five is under no illusions about the challenge ahead, but he feels being the only foreign-owned and run club in the hugely populated nation will have its advantages."Having seen how the Chinese people run their clubs over there, we believe we can do it a lot more efficiently," he said.Marveggio has already got runs on the board as part of the ownership group which took over Adelaide United in Australia's A-League in November 2010. The club recently won the A-League Premiership and Championship, after also winning the cup competition, the FFA Cup, in its inaugural year, in 2014.The A-League imposes a $2.6 million salary cap â€” vastly different from the free-spending Chinese leagues.The top-tier Super League clubs spent a combined $380 million during the month-long January transfer window, attracting some of the world's best players with the lure of riches greater than those on offer in Europe.But Marveggio intends to use some of the lessons he has learned from Adelaide United's success to get to the top in China."We're going to be having good coaches and targeting good players, not just name players but actually putting together good squads like Leicester City and Adelaide United did.Known by some as the Switzerland of the east, in part due to a European influence in some of its architecture, Qingdao is an area in eastern Shandong Province on the east coast of China with a population of about 9 million people.The region is better known for its Tsingtao beer than its success in soccer.Despite its spending, China itself still has some way to go to be a soccer superpower, having only qualified once for the World Cup Finals (in 2002).Ranked 81st in the world, the national team just scrapped through to the third round of qualifying for the 2018 World Cup after losing to Qatar.But China's President Xi Jinping has identified soccer as a major platform to show his nation's sporting strength as well as tapping into its consumer culture.He has initiated programs to increase participation in the sport with a plan to double the size of China's sporting economy by 2025. And that is where private investors like Marveggio, who has travelled about China for 16 years, and FIFA registered player-agent and club president Piet van der Pol come in."It's difficult enough to do business in China for the Chinese people, let alone a foreigner so establishing a football club in China as a foreigner is an unbelievable task. You just can't underestimate what's been achieved."The club will also open other business doors."For me personally it opens doors to more investors, Chinese business people and it extends Chinese Government networks that we've already got so there's a benefit there as well."Former Netherlands international left back Jan Poortvliet is coaching the side, having previously coached a number of clubs in his home country, as well as Southampton in England.Kwame Quansah, who has two caps for Ghana, and Swede David Lofquist, who was signed by Italian club Parma in 2011, have been brought in to complement the mostly Chinese playing line-up."The Super League standard is very high because they're bringing in quality players and more importantly quality coaches. When you get to league three that we're in we'll be just about the only club with a foreign coach," Marveggio said."The standard isn't comparable to the A-League, even though the players are technically very good," he said.For now, Marveggio suggests his interests in Qingdao and Adelaide United will remain separate, but he is not shutting the door completely on a potential partnership down the track and has flagged interest in taking the venture to Europe.
