Director Quentin Tarantino has revealed he does not mind Chinese bootleggers illegally distributing his films to get around strict censorship laws. The relationship between Hollywood and China is often tenuous, and with no classification board, filmmakers have had to contend with the demands of Chinese censors. Tarantino experienced this when his 2012 film Django Unchained was approved for release, pulled from cinemas and re-released with three minutes of scenes cut.Tarantino said he would not necessarily have a Chinese release of his latest film The Hateful Eight."We didn't make any money on it [Django Unchained] but at the same time people saw it all over the place because they see it on bootleg out there and everything," he told the ABC."I have a lot of Chinese fans who buy my movies on the street and watch them and I'm OK with it."I'm not OK with it in other places, but if the Government's going to censor me then I want the people to see it in any way they can."China is set to overtake the US as the biggest film market in as little as two years, however the country limits to only 34 foreign films being released annually.Dealing with China is all about relationship-building, that's why it's a step-by-step process. The box office in China grew by 48.7 per cent in 2015 to reach a record of $US6.78 billion, according to industry website the Hollywood Reporter. This was six times more than Australia's box office, Screen Australia said.Veteran actor Kurt Russell, who stars in The Hateful Eight, said China would be an important market for Hollywood in the future."There's a lot of people who want to see movies there and that's great, they also have a burgeoning business that's all around the motion picture making aspect of it. I think it's exciting," Russell said.Australian film makers are looking for a share in the Chinese market and ways to comply with quota restrictions and censorship regulation.In November, a cross-section of the Australian film industry met with a major delegation from China for a co-production forum to explore opportunities for foreign and local filmmakers through location, post and visual effect production. Screen Australia enterprise and industry manager Elena Guest said there were already many Australian film production companies working with Chinese-based counterparts."I think what happens is when a film's being made the Chinese film producer and the Australian film producer have to work together in a co-production to come up with a script that's suitable for approval by the Chinese Government, so they start very early in the piece," she said. Under the co-production treaty between Australia and China, films made between the two countries do not count towards China's foreign quota.Ausfilm, a government-industry partnership, said Australia had seen increasing interest both from Chinese film makers filming and producing in Australia, and Australian film makers taking their films to Chinese markets. "Dealing with China is all about relationship-building, that's why it's a step-by-step process," Ausfilm chief executive Debra Richards said.The Federal Government has also been pushing for more films to be made in Australia, and with a depreciating Australian dollar and attractive tax incentives, Hollywood has come knocking, but China is increasingly holding sway in how movies are made because of its increasing market dominance.In October, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop announced two feature films from director Ridley Scott would be filmed in Australia, bringing in more than $300 million, providing 3,000 jobs and service thousands of Australian businesses.Listen to Thuy Ong's report on PM from 6.05pm on ABC Local Radio and 5pm on Radio National.
