The Chinese president will come to Tasmania next month when he visits Australia for the G20 Leaders' Summit in Brisbane.Xi Jinping will be among the world leaders attending the summit on November 15 and 16.After the summit the Chinese president will travel to Hobart, securing international media exposure for Tasmania.Premier Will Hodgman said it was wonderful news for the state."The visit will present unparalleled opportunities to promote our state to the world and to further strengthen the economic and cultural ties between China and Tasmania," he said."China is our state's largest trading partner, with merchandise and exports of $610 million."Mr Hodgman said the visit would coincide with TasInvest, a week-long showcase of Tasmanian industry and investment opportunities.The Chinese leader would only be on the ground for a few hours but the impact of such a visit would be huge for Tasmania.Chinese arrivals to Tasmania have jumped almost 50 per cent in recent months with almost 20,000 Chinese tourists visiting the state in the past year.Luke Martin from the Tourism Industry Council said the benefits of the President Xi's visit should not be underestimated."It's probably be the largest international media gathering that's ever happened in Tasmania," he said.Today's confirmation from the Australian Government comes after almost two years of speculation.Moves to make the visit happen began in December 2012, when then-premier Lara Giddings invited Xi Jinping to Tasmania a month after he became president.Xi Jinping was previously governor of Fujian Province, Tasmania's sister state in China.He then raised the possibility of visiting Tasmania when former prime minister Julia Gillard visited China early last year.Ms Gillard said the president displayed an extensive knowledge of Tasmania.
