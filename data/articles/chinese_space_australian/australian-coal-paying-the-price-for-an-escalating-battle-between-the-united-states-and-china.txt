If it were an isolated event, the trade kerfuffle at a port in north-east China would be nothing to worry about.Taken in the context of global events during the past year, however, the banning of Australian coal by Dalian port authorities is a significant ratcheting up of regional and international tensions with far wider and potentially more damaging ramifications.While the bans cover less than 10 per cent of our coal exports to China, the decision, and the cryptic message from China's foreign ministry — hinting at diplomatic retaliation against Australia — need to be seen in a much broader context.By next Friday, the United States and China must hammer out some kind of truce on trade.If not, America's 10 per cent tariff penalty on Chinese goods suddenly will catapult to 25 per cent.The trade disputes between the world's two biggest economies — part of a philosophical and cultural power play threatening to plunge the globe into a new Cold War era — have already put the brakes on global growth.China's economy is feeling the pinch, precisely the effect United States President Donald Trump had in mind when he embarked upon his economic assault against the Middle Kingdom.What he didn't envisage was the impact at home. Consumer sentiment has dropped to its lowest level this century. US manufacturing contracted in January. Quarterly earnings from American corporates have gone backwards in the latest quarter. Retail sales plunged in December with the worst performance since the global financial meltdown.Across Europe, it's a similar story. Italy is in recession, Germany has barely avoided slipping into one and UK manufacturing has plunged.Financial markets have ignored pretty much all this. Instead, traders and investors have rejoiced in the news that America's central bank, the US Federal Reserve, has backed away from raising interest rates.How else do you explain the huge rally on Wall Street since the New Year, up around 15 per cent?For now, the message from our leaders is that this will all blow over. China needs our resources, the argument goes, as much as we need China.There is a certain logic to this train of thought.Australian coal generally has higher energy content than most other exporters, meaning it is more efficient and produces less pollution.That's an important consideration for Chinese leaders dealing with a restless population.In any case, Dalian, a north-east Chinese port, is not a major destination for our coal. While the bulk of our iron ore is unloaded at Dalian, more than 90 per cent of Australian coal is delivered to ports in southern China. So, a ban would have limited impact.It's a reasonable argument, so long as you ignore the mounting evidence of an increasingly fractious relationship between Canberra and Beijing.For months now, there has been a go-slow on coal imports. Dozens of coal-laden ships have been queued off ports across China as delays have extended beyond 40 days.Since October, when the delays began, it was thought Chinese authorities were trying to protect local coal producers, particularly as the economy cools.But the order to ban imports of Australian coal while accepting coal from Russia and elsewhere, hints at deliberate intent. This was a shot across the bow.It's not the first time Beijing has used trade to send a message to Canberra.Last May, Australian wine exporters suddenly found themselves unable to clear their cargo through customs following the introduction of "new and additional verification requirements".The new requirements applied only to Australian wines. A month earlier, Xi Jinping delivered the ultimate snub to Canberra when, for the first time, not one Australian politician was invited to the Boao Forum on Hainan.The annual schmooze event for the rich and powerful, an Asian version of the Davos annual gathering, has become a powerful diplomatic tool for Beijing as it strives for global dominance.The snub followed strong statements from then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull."Media reports have suggested the Chinese Communist Party has been working to covertly interfere with our media, our universities and even the decisions of elected representatives right here in this building," he told Parliament in December 2017.Earlier this week, Prime Minister Scott Morrison revealed a series of attempted cyber hacks against the Liberal, Labor and National parties.While he wouldn't be drawn on the origin, most media outlets reported that China was behind the attacks.Then there was the decision, ahead of most other Western nations, to ban Huawei from any involvement in rolling out Australia's 5G network.Last week, Beijing abandoned a tourism partnership deal with New Zealand, apparently because it too had banned Huawei from its telecommunications plans.That all depends on how far Mr Trump wants to push things.China would be shooting itself in the foot with a long-term or even limited ban on Australian resources. But there's a great deal of foot shooting about right now.There's doubt as to what exactly the US is demanding in its negotiations with Beijing; a trade rebalancing or a much broader overhaul of their economic system.Either way, it won't be resolved easily or quickly, and certainly not by next Friday.The escalating battle between the two global superpowers will continue to impact growth, which will hurt exporters like us.But the diplomatic fallout could be tougher, particularly if we have to choose sides.
