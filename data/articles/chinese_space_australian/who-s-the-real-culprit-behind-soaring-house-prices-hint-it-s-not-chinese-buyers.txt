As easy as it is to point the finger at Chinese buyers amid rising tensions over housing affordability, the real culprit is right here at home, writes Ian Verrender.For all the hullaballoo about the flood of Chinese cash into domestic real estate, there's one Aussie house that is seriously on the nose with our northern neighbours.Actually, make that three.For the past year or so, James Packer has been snubbed by Chinese punters, who for years were so enamoured with his Macau gambling dens that he eventually built three of them.After plummeting 40 per cent last year, revenues for the year so far are down a further 37 per cent.It's not just our James and his good mate Lawrence Ho suffering either. All the Macau casino operators have seen their earnings decimated, with the industry notching up 11 straight months of heavy declines, and now dropping to a mere $US3 billion a month.The reason? The Chinese government has cracked down on corruption. Money laundering has come under the watchful gaze of Beijing. Perhaps it's a huge coincidence. But the casino crackdown seems to have coincided with the latest deluge of Chinese cash washing through property markets around the Pacific. If you can't launder your money through Macau, best to get it out of the country altogether.Australia - and particularly Sydney and Melbourne - are favoured destinations. But Auckland is high on the list. So too is Vancouver. And in California, Chinese purchasers are swamping the San Francisco market.Headlines around the Pacific are eerily similar. Take this one from The Diplomat from a few weeks back: "Chinese Buyers Fuel California Property Bubble."In Vancouver, the average price for detached houses sits just under $2 million, after rising 173 per cent in the past decade.The Globe and Mail tells the story of a couple who, having paid $C488,000 for a house in 2000, put it up for sale in March. Within two hours, they had an offer for $2.29 million and accepted $2.48 million to a mainland China buyer.Australia recently signed a Free Trade Agreement with China and the final draft of that deal is due to be delivered within weeks.While we've been regaled with promises of vast trading opportunities and fabulous profits, it will be interesting to see whether anyone among the vast army of advisors to the deal has bothered to ask this simple question: if it is illegal to take more than $US50,000 out of China, why are so many Chinese nationals capable of splurging millions of dollars on individual properties?There is a simple answer to that: China doesn't enforce its rules.The most common way to secrete cash out of China has been through "padding" of trading company invoices - a play on transfer pricing. The second most popular method was through Macau gambling dens.When combined with the rorts surrounding Australia's Significant Investor Visa scheme - where a $5 million investment buys foreigners permanent residence - Australia was open for business when it came to real estate.Despite all the evidence, all the media reports and the outcry within the community, the Significant Investor Visa loophole - where foreigners simply borrowed the $5 million back from an investment bank to buy real estate, using their $5 million investment as collateral - has only just been closed.So far, the FIRB and the Treasurer, Joe Hockey, have found just one foreign investor - Xu Jiayin, one of China's richest individuals - who has breached foreign investment guidelines. His $39 million Sydney harbourside mansion, was forcibly sold recently amid a publicity blitz.The buyer, however, was a wealthy Chinese national, Lola Wang Li; a woman who maintains she has no links with Xu.The Chinese incursion into Australian residential real estate - and the unwillingness of Australian regulatory bodies to enforce the law - is part of a broader malaise that has seen regulators from the FIRB and the Department of Immigration through to the banking regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority, and the Australian Tax Office reluctant to act.As easy as it is to point the finger at Chinese buyers amid rising tensions over housing affordability, the real culprit is right here at home.This is the result of a lack of oversight and enforcement from a federal bureaucracy denuded of staff for the best part of a decade and a federal government that appears unable or unwilling to identify a problem.No one, it seems, has had any interest in reining in the runaway housing market, a point hammered home by Prime Minister Tony Abbott last week when he expressed a desire for prices to keep on rising, despite a blunt warning from new Treasury head John Fraser.The following day, as he ramped up the notion into a political fight - Bill Shorten wants your house to decrease in value - Hockey attempted to argue that soaring house prices and affordability were separate issues.What seems to have eluded our political masters is that market adage - the bigger the boom, the more painful the bust.Then of course there is the constant moan from the business lobby; Australia is too costly, wages are too high. There is a reason for that. It's called real estate. For the past 15 years, rents have dictated wages. Not the other way around.No matter how you measure it, Sydney and Melbourne real estate is in dangerous territory, fuelled by a heady mixture of cheap cash from foreign and domestic investors.When it unravels, the pain will reverberate through the banking system, causing enormous damage to the real economy.A major reason for the official inaction is that this is a bubble that has been deliberately contrived.In 2012, when the Reserve Bank began its easing bias, it was determined to create a housing boom - so residential construction could fill the gap created by the decline in resource project construction.But as investors, rather than owner occupiers, plunged in almost from day one, APRA and the RBA should have taken action. Instead, they were happy to watch the bubble inflate and now, rather than admit a mistake, reluctantly are playing catch-up.A large portion of the investor action emanated from self-funded retirees, taking advantage of changes to superannuation rules that allowed them to gear up their super funds.While as a nation we boast about the extent of our national savings pool, little attention has been devoted to the fact that a significant amount of that pool is now exposed.As the Storm Financial collapse graphically illustrated, the capital losses on a property market bust will be magnified by debt. That could wipe out a significant number of super balances and put more pressure on the federal budget.After months of procrastination, APRA finally has begun to enforce its own rules on high risk lending. But it may be too late.In 2010, capital city property prices, particularly in Sydney, declined by 10 per cent in what was a relatively orderly retreat.But the enormous gains of the past two years, which clearly has the new Treasury head concerned, will ensure the next decline will be anything but orderly.Ian Verrender is the ABC's business editor.

Comments for this story are closed.08 Jun 2015 7:42:34amThe cause of the problem is the ridiculously inefficient use or residential land that is Macburbia. People are simply capitalising the future cost of all that travel and loss of life amenity from living so far out in the sticks and paying a premium to live closer to the CBD.Increasing average density is the only rational response. You can do that with apartment towers but IMO they are only attractive as precision bombing targets and utterly unnecessary. Unfortunately they are a very attractive option to large developers and their financiers for various reasons.Allowing townhouse/terrace type density, duplex type options more widely would be a rational response. Start by rezoning close to arterial and sub arterial roads and close to transport/shopping hubs would make most sense leaving the detached housing areas intact and largely unaffected. After that the market can sort itself out.Even macburbia could do with a makeover of the planning rubrics. The setback and height rules are understandable in their vague intent but irrational in their actual effect. The simple fact is that  house designs today do not look like small farmhouses in a paddock and are much more urban in design. Trying to preserve a 50's aesthetic is absurd and as block sizes reduce all it does is drive up the number of two storey places surrounded by narrow ribbons of 'open' space. 'Confined' space more ike it. Dogs at the pound have about the same 'open' space if you ask me.

08 Jun 2015 8:27:17amDear Ursus AugustusFro many years I and many others have been told that the way of the future is apartments, row houses etc and that transport will have to be bike/rail/bus.All no doubt economically the best systems, and many people have adopted them, at least in part.But the reality is that as soon as Australians get some capital behind them, they want a house with a garden, with some distance from neighbours.  (At least more than a few bricks).This may seem astounding to the inner city elites who struggle to imagine living in suburb without at least six coffee shops in walking distance, but some of us have different priorities, particularly when children are involved.  I am a perfect example.In my youth, I was more than happy to inhabit (I hesitate to say "live in") a small apartment.  When married, a duplex close to work was fine.  When children came: a large houses in the suburbs, with a garden and proper neighbours, not just people I nodded to as I went in and out.  A place where my children grew up with room to move, not like rabbits in a hutch.It may be enjoyable to speculate about the most rational way to build our cities, but humans have other desires that can sometimes defy rational analysis.  Until that is accepted and solutions sought to the problems it may cause, there will be little progress.

08 Jun 2015 9:58:58amI would suggest anyone commenting on urban density look up the Productivity Commission report of about fifteen years ago which calculated the sizes of theoretical cities of the same populations but different densities and the result between high and low density was in fact amazingly small because you had large constants such as roads hospitals and parks and recreational areas.

You would need a road so tradesmen ambulences etc could attend builidings. Just think of a few areas where vehicles are banned but the roads are still there, Wengen the Swiss ski resort , roads for the electric carts moving the tourists ski gear, Cien Fuegos in Cuba which bans vehicles in the center but employs laborers with large wheelbarrows to do the same thing.

08 Jun 2015 6:24:59pmtotally agree, not only that, far stretching suburbs like in Australia are completely unsustainable due to our water shortage. At times, I cannot believe what I see, haven't we got many developed nations to look at and use examples? Our houses are built to use up utilities (no eves, no shades), either to cool or to heat, we don't offer a great deal of public transport (it's terrible in comparison with Europe) and our rents and living costs are among the highest in the world. I just don't get it.

The big problem is everyone going to the same place at the same time every weekday.

09 Jun 2015 12:01:40pmI have 2 kids, I live at the beginning of the middle-urban ring of the city (~7-8kms)  close to rail. I am lucky enough to have a good sized block. (~650m) with only a moderate setback which makes a big difference to utilisable space at the back.I fully support urban infill. I am not going to infill my property but there is plenty of land in and around my area suitable. We also have plenty of quality walkable open space and primary schools. I don't see why kids would make one bit of difference to my position. We have dropped a car. Walk and cycle LOADS and utilise public transport frequently. If you want a large city and don't want to blow infrastructure budgets its the only way. In my city the mistake most people make is equating the mythical magical "COAST" to high quality lifestyle. Most of these people don't consider transport as an important option when buying a place to live, they live on a postage stamp block with no outdoor space and then complain mercilessly when it takes the 1 hour to get anywhere in one of their 4 cars. I say again. How are kids influencing this choice?

09 Jun 2015 12:50:13pmIts all very well shoving people into high density areas, full of those awful high rise apartments. Problem is, the more people you shove in there, the more money has to be spent on schools, hospitals, transport etc to meet the burgeoning need. Our State Governments however are reluctant to spend the money to improve infrastructure. They are happy to have all of those extra tax payers, but not happy to improve services. This is already becoming a problem and it will get worse as the population increase continues. High Density isn't the answer.
Alert moderator
08 Jun 2015 10:53:26amTabanus, as long as there is plenty of quality open space in close proximity then most people don't have any issues with relatively high densities. The reality is that many outer suburban areas give the worst of both worlds, they utilise the entire block with indoor living areas and there is minimal provision for outdoor open space (private or communal). Even where there is outdoor space there is no provision to walk to it.  People are too scared to send their kids outside so they drive them everywhere. Everyone spend the bulk of their time either in a traffic jam or inside their 250 sqm home (probably in the theater room) and contemplates their ever increasing girth.  Another serious point to be made is that we have increased our national population by more than a third in about 25 years. It is changing the very fabric and culture of our country.

08 Jun 2015 12:13:34pmI think low density live is only a fad and dream of the last decade.  Looking forward to the future and designing of cities in places like Asia and Europe. High density living is the only way forward. Especially as we add a few more billion people to the earth. We are already running out of usable land for housing and agriculture, without continuing our impact on the environment. It is estimated that we will almost double our population in Australia by 2060. Imagine a Sydney almost twice the size it currently is in 45 years.We need to give up a bit so more people can live in cities and keep the environment protected from sprawl. Let face it, big houses will only be a thing for the future rich. The majority of the world (probably 95%) will have to face high density living as a norm.

08 Jun 2015 12:22:19pmTabanus,I have no problem with the large suburban block or the larger semi rural block but I do have a problem with using a planning rubric that effectively uses a parametric desrcroption of the former as some sort of ideal. In other words dictating that this is some sort of optimum arrangement to which the market must conform.Of course the pressures of reality have manifested long ago on this and the planning response was to shrink block sizes while maintaining the main elements of the rubric ( setsbacks etc). As Scotty A points out what has happened is that as blocks got smaller houses have got bigger and lifestyle has tended towards that which might be associated with apartment living, i.e. much more indoors but without the collateral advantages of nearby shops, restaurants, theatres, jobs, public transport etc. All I am saying is that being the actual reality then it is time that the planning rubric adapts to one which permits an efficient use of these now smaller blocks. For example, outdoor open space is effectively mandated to be sliced up by front, side and rear setbacks ito subsections that are manifestly useless except as somewhere to but the rubbish bins. Zero setback should be permissible subject to the particular site considerations. I could go one for page after page regarding the bizarre and counter productive actual outcomes now permissible.It seems to me that much building design is not driven by the outcomes in utility and amenity but by what it looks like on a 3D graphic which is in turn about marketing 'off the plan' which is driven by the commercial interests of the developers and their financiers. That is not to criticise them, they are acting in rational self interest and have to operate in accord with the same loony toons planning and design rubric which distorts what they can reaspoanably offer to the market. Non conforming DA's, including apartments etc, are high risk to bring on line thanks to the rubric paradigm and tend to be filtered out on a risk basis leaving home brand, macburbia on the shelves.John CoocheyWhich report was that? Aspects of Structural Change in Australia? There is one about telecommunications density which on the face of it suggests the opposite.It may well be that cities can trend towards a similar aggregate size but it is clear that much of our open space, public and private has little amenity and serves only to separate people, not to provide communal access. The numbers may be the same but I doubt if the reality is.

08 Jun 2015 4:40:34pmBut even pointing out people's desire to live in the burbs with their kids is a bit silly.It has nothing to do with increasing average density and the two don't conflict in any way. Increasing the density of transport hubs, employment centres etc. allows young people, students, single people, some families and retirees to CHOOSE whether they want to live a 45 minute (or more like an hour's during the peak) drive from their work/leisure/study/friends etc.Not only would it be good for rents and the economy, but increasing the density in some areas takes the pressure off the fringes. Take a look at Yanchep in Perth or Weribee in Melbourne. These houses don't have room for your kids. They don't have yards by my or probably your definition. The houses have gotten bigger and the lots are smaller than the leafy dreamy suburbia that only exists in central areas like Nedlands, not far from Perth city.Not forcing everyone to conform to Mcburbia would allow those like you who want it to enjoy REAL open, green suburbs. With the current state of things you'll find kids growing up closer to the city with better access to parks, not needing to be driven half an hour to school and with local amenity unlike the lie that is places like Ellenbrook. They have far more space to grow up, they're less antisocial and have better opportunities and are often healthier, and this isn't saying something about the denser living...But even hint at this and you usually get sour old blokes crying 'Greeny communism!' and 'If being cramped against your neighbours is so great why not give Shanghai a go?'Look at Stockholm. Medium density at the hubs, almost rural feel a short drive from them, and NO high density. This is what both suburbians and city dwellers want, but don't realise they're not actually opposed to each other.

08 Jun 2015 7:08:19pmThat is exactly what I was trying to get across Bannicus.It is about allowing the market to provide a range of housing options without unreasonable planning hurdles which basically the problem now. The only viable alternative to mcburbia is inner city high rise where big developers can hunt down a suitable property and do the design and lobbying necessary to increase the number of floors and maximise returns. It is unhealthy to favour one option and only allow the extreme alternatives under pressure from significant vested interest.

08 Jun 2015 8:49:52amTotally brilliant comment and article by Ian. My youngest son decided against panic buying into today's crazy market a long time ago and rents a cheap 50's house privately. The owner is very glad to have a dependable tenant and very happy not to feeding a greedy property manager. However my main point is that he made his decision when quoted a ridiculous sum for a sandpatch when he was in the market. "Mining price" was the answer when he told the selling agent she was dreaming. Readers will not be surprised to note that we live in the collapsing dreamworld of WA !!!I have no idea what is keeping property prices afloat but I don't want to be around when the whole thing goes down as it surely must !!

08 Jun 2015 8:54:15amThe cause of the problem is punters seeking capital gains.Interest rates are too low to give any decent return to investors so they must seek capital gains.The productive means of making money were shut down by the high dollar, both business and investors have been reluctant to expand or develop any manufacturing enterprises.But all this suits property owners. If foreign buyers are offering a profit, it is still a profit. In the short term anyway, and no one in this country looks more than a year or two ahead.

Capital gains have not been isolated to inner city properties. Travelling consistently between Sydney and Far North Qld. has allowed an observation as to how waves of investment are seen after bubbles arise in the cities. Its like a chain reaction. The flush city seller pays more for a property than might a local. Its to the point where properties on the Atherton Tablelands can be more expensive than the Central Coast, but, without the amenities, and experiencing larger fuel expenses. These country towns offer a good lifestyle.If the need for shelter is a driver then small country towns are attractive, and could see a similar flow out of the cities as happened in the 60s and 70s?

08 Jun 2015 2:16:56pmthere is an incredibly easy fix for illegal property purchases.Every bill of sale will have two sets of check boxes.1. Do you have an Australian passport? Yes/No (verified by conveyancer/lawyer)2. If no, do you have proof of residency? (Also needs to be verified)If no, or no proof supplied, the sale does not proceed. If resident only, a copy of the sale goes to the ATO/FIRB.Any breaches result in the agent/conveyancer/lawyer loosing their license and getting large fines.

08 Jun 2015 5:08:36pmPreserving and enhancing the lifestyle of Australians is challenging. Our improved living standards over the past two decades have main come from two factors: cheap imports and both parents in a family working. House prices compared to average weekly earnings have roughly doubled, which can be linked to both parents working. The second challenge is that unskilled and low-skilled jobs are rapidly disappearing. Currently the main cause is cheap labour overseas, but robotics are starting to have more of an impact.Uber are researching driverless cars so that drivers are no longer required. I would expect that within 5 years we will start to see driverless cars replacing taxis and except for premium services, this will be complete with 10 years. This will be another group of jobs gone.

08 Jun 2015 9:08:52amHonestly, did you even read the article. What is happening in Sydney currently has nothing to do with local conditions - this is global. What you are talking about isn't necessarily bad, but what is driving the current boom in house prices is something different. It is a flight of capital out of China. It is not limited to Sydney. It is happening in a dozen "global cities". I am currently in Auckland (partly due to the unaffordability of Sydney), and the same is happening here, only even faster as rules are more relaxed on foreign ownership. I was working with a bloke from Vancouver this morning, and they are seeing exactly the same thing.Spouting of well meaning local solutions to a global problem misses the point. Yes, we can do all of that, but we need to look at the particular factors influencing our property market at this particular point in time.

08 Jun 2015 9:47:17am"Start by rezoning close to arterial and sub arterial roads and close to transport/shopping hubs".In principle this is a good suggestion, Ursus Augustus, but we would have to do something about the nature and quantity of emissions from road transport.  If we assume the switch to electric vehicles will occur - which our government appears presently unlikely to support - the idea has real merit.  If we are to continue building the numbers and maintaining the emission levels of road transport, a growing health problem remains the legacy of inner-city or transport hub proximity living.If transport goes largely electrical, your arguments have serious merit.
Alert moderator
08 Jun 2015 10:42:19amThe proximity to arterial routes and hubs means public transport is favoured which means buses (which might be electric in due course) and light and heavy rail. That is part of the point. Either way, road congestion is reduced as walking / cycling is also more viable. The reason some people favour the inner city is the hassle of having to drive everywhere. Enhancing hubs is about creating more local options from jobs to shops to whatever. It is not about destroying macburbia, it is about allowing the market to supply affordable alternatives and not just in high land value areas.This issue is the result of a series of iterative evolutions in the wrong direction but at a time when no one really saw it coming. It will not be solved with some sweeping magic solution but by putting in place the elements whereby a more sustainable and stable alternative will naturally tend to evolve.As for the the comments that this is all some China driven thing, bulldust. This has been an issue for some time and is just hitting harder and quicker due to the capital inflow from China. The underlying problem was always there. Housing prices is just one symptom of the same problem.If you want to rip the guts out of energy use, emissions, cost of living and at the same time improve living amenity then enabling alternatives to the macburban monoculture is the only viable way of doing it. Otherwise we will end up with a macburban sprawl and an apartment tower dominated centre. If you want to see endemic and ugly cultural division in our community that is a sure fire way to create it.

08 Jun 2015 12:20:07pmThe cause of the housing affordability problem is plainly and simply population growth.  Australia is growing by a million people every three years, 60% of whom are immigrants, 40% are born here.  All those people have to live somewhere, pushing up housing prices.The choice isn't between densification and sprawl, because we will get both.  We can jam people into shoe box apartments in thirty storey towers, ignoring all planning schemes and classifying service roads, driveways and parking spaces as "open space" for recreational purposes, but the results won't be happy or attractive.Why do we have to have to have the population growth in the first place?  The only beneficiaries are the big property companies and the political parties to whom they munificently donate.

Australia is growing by a million people every three years, 60% of whom are immigrants, 40% are born here. All those people have to live somewhere, pushing up housing prices."Sorry, but housing affordability is only an issue in the capitals capitals and its commuting satellites. The real problem is that there is insufficient civil planning to encourage the population to spread more evenly around the habitable zones (not just the coastal fringe). As a result, more and more people are being squeezed into a limited area, allowing for demand driven price rises of every kind. Once you know that your market isn't going anywhere else, it is much easier to jack up prices and achieve them.By way of example of housing away from the capitals, I recently purchased an older 3-bedroom house in good condition on 600 sqm for $80k. That was the full price, not the deposit.The house is located in walking distance to the regional hospital, schools, public swimming pool and shops. The area itself is stable with a modest growth rate.Only in the capitals and their satellites is there evidence that a lack of housing capacity is forcing up housing prices astronomically.Australia has most of its population in its half-dozen capital cities. That is what the real problem is, not a lack of capacity for housing development.NSW - 65% of the population in Sydney, Victoria - 77% in Melbourne, Queensland - 48%,  South Australia - 77% in Adelaide, Western Australia - 78% in Perth.Compare this to Germany - 4.5% in Berlin; England - 16% in London Metro area; France - 25% in Paris Metro area; and Spain - 14% in Madrid.

08 Jun 2015 7:51:41amHigh prices reflect high demand... high demand by mass immigration policies of liberal, labor and Greens. Whilst the Greens try to pretend its all about negative gearing. Even the ABC fact checker dispelled the link between prices and negative gearing.  I hope prices fall - at least our children might be able to afford a place of their own rather than be sold out by the major political parties.

08 Jun 2015 8:52:17amThe high demand is simply the result of very low interest rates, it's not immigration policy. This is why it frustrates me to see lazy journalism like this, a fall in interest rates to the extent witnessed in recent years was always going to drive asset (including property) prices up. If anything, the fact that interest rates have fallen by more than half since the GFC, yet prices have only risen by 40% (in nominal terms, much less in real terms) in Sydney and Melbourne, and much less elsewhere, would be less of a rise than most would have expected.When borrowing rates halve, prices would need to rise by 100% to keep repayments the same, but in fact they have risen by much less than that. So the average repayment per household is much lower than it was before the GFC. So it's simply not true to say: 'No matter how you measure it, Sydney and Melbourne real estate is in dangerous territory'Because on the key measure, repayments as a proportion of household income, it has actually got more affordable! So despite what we might read in every second article, the rise in house prices is simply a completely foreseeable response to lower interest rates, and is not a bubble. Ian, it would be useful if you could spend some time in an article examining why house prices are out of line with fundamentals (demand/supply/interest rates) and therefore why we are in bubble territory.

08 Jun 2015 9:22:27amReally prices have only risen 40% since the GFC, RGR. Not where I live. Could have bought the neighbours house then. Its now worth more than double what was paid. Where I live prices have increase 50% in the last 18 months. 37% last year alone. Guess what a great proportion of those are Chinese, which is not surprising given that a large percentage of my suburb are. Their presence divides the community given what has happened in the local shops. I think they add vitality to what was a dying WASP monoculture.

08 Jun 2015 10:05:00amAlgernon,An interesting observation.In my opinion we are making a mistake trying to pinpoint what is the problem, I suspect there is more than one aspect to this and the blogs here suggest that.Desire to have a decent house and garden to raise kids, Super funds being allowed to borrow, low interest rates causing two things, retires looking for yield and buyers being able to borrow more. Couple that with the Chinese buyers and you have a mix of factors that probably build on each other. And while the authorities have been slow to act, and remember state govt's get a lot of their income from stamp duty, there may not be just one solution.

08 Jun 2015 2:19:13pmYes indeed. Lots of factors combining here, most of them based on greed and indifference, all adding to the flow-on of migrations to regional and rural areas, where the newly arrived will be oblivious to the flora and fauna they displaced while they set about creating there own TV-lifestyle-show garden of exotic plants, all to the detriment of native species.

08 Jun 2015 10:19:56amAlgernon, I have to say that I doubt your suburb has risen by 37% in the last 12 months. Data on median house prices per city are freely available on the ABS website and this is the best source for making policy on (not a suburb by suburb look). My 40% was based on the rise in median prices for Sydney between the peak of the interest rates in the GFC and now, I'm not sure where you got your figure for in the last 12 months, but as I say, let's talk about at least city averages since this is what the RBA will be looking at when setting interest rates. As for a lot of buyers being chinese (or I suspect, looking chinese to you, many are likely to be Australian citizens) I'm not sure that is relevant. Immigration (if in fact this is immigration and not simple Australians who look chinese to you) will only account for a very small part of the demand for housing. By far the biggest driver behind house price rises is low interest rates.
Alert moderator
08 Jun 2015 11:52:17amInterest rates won't remain low forever. Sure, it may be rational right now for people to put money into real estate. But it's rational to enter into any bubble while it's still on the rise. As long as you can get out in time, that is.

08 Jun 2015 12:23:55pmRGR, I'll make it easier for you. I live in Eastwood NSW. The last census shows that 36% of people in the suburb were born overseas. predominantly China. One side of the suburbs shops is Chinese the other is Korean. I've lived he for more than half my life and had an association for all of my life. In my street two years ago nine properties were sold (five a redevelopment). All but one were bought by Chinese. Title records bear that out as did the Chinese born neighbour two doors up who verified this.My childrens primary school (they're adults now had 47 different nationalities at it . I gave the community vitality. Their sporting club (I've been on the committee for most of their time there reflects the census results. Heck even the team one is in now and has been for six years. Is half ethnically Chinese (I know the families).No you should check for yourself and you will find the the average house in Eastwood in 2014 went from $1.01m to $1.39m. Its not that difficult. I suggest you have a good look at surrounding suburbs as well with similar increases. could I also suggest that you have a look at who is building the multi storey developments in the district. Most are Chinese developers.The increase for a number of years has been its proximity to a university, the IT hub at Macquarie Park, its transport links as well as sort after schools.As for the Chinese, well I live amongst them, work, share schools, meals sporting events, friendship. My comments are not a generalisation, unlike yours.

Also the demand side of population growth to expand infrastructure that is indebting our governments. Given governments around the world are so much in debt, I can't see our own reserve bank exiting the currency wars which they belatedly realized was going on ..

08 Jun 2015 9:12:24amSmart people know that there is rarely one factor leading to such a monumental change as this. There is no question that negative gearing is one of the existing factors, and it is no coincidence that the only three nations in the world with negative gearing are all experiencing house price bubbles. However the laundering of illegal Chinese money is another huge influence on our housing bubble, and people like me will be looking in years to come to have politicians of TODAY jailed for the treason they committed in failing to protect the interests of Australians against a clear foreign threat. So they need not rest easy. We will be coming for them in their beds.

08 Jun 2015 4:08:03pmI see four factors1) Negative Gearing2) Migration and Foreign ownership3) Interest rates4) Building regulationsNegative gearing helps multiple property owners but more.  We assist the richest.  Migration and foreign ownership add to the demand.  Every other purchasable item in the economy seems to be impacted by supply and demand.  For people to separate house prices from this is ridiculous.  Interest rates - People will pay roughly as much, what differs is the percentage between banks and previous owner/developer.  Its kind of irrelevant for affordability for first home buyers.  Building regulations - All about the supply.  If you could build anywhere without any regulation then quality would decrease and supply would increase.  All except 3 is easily addressable.  1, is being proposed by the Greens and possibly by the ALP but as per norm the ALP is too cowardly to show their hand or take any serious action on an issue that isnt simply extra spending.  2, is being ignored by all parties.  4, is a state government issue.

08 Jun 2015 9:14:57amThe Fact Checker "dispelled" the link between negative gearing and rising rents, not house prices - but it actually didn't, it confirmed it - take a closer look. The most inaccurate and frankly disingenuous Fact Check so far.Also - just how far do you think prices'll have to fall to make housing affordable? I'll tell you - so far that the economy'll go into free fall. And you'll have a lot of VERY pissed-off home owners baying for blood, despite the facts. Everywhere, including rural areas, is WAY overpriced, not just Sydney and Melbourne, which is obvious really - i.e.. Why should everyone else have to dip out on huge bags of cash? Think any party wants to take THAT one on? I think even the Greens might demure, once they take a closer look. Don't forget, a VAST amount of the Greens' support comes from young (and older, like me) people.Also, if negative gearing is stopped, rents everywhere will also rise, for exactly the same reason. When those who've profited from negative gearing put rents up if it goes, do you really think other rental property owners - historically not the most unselfish of individuals - won't jack their prices up?Thus making it harder for anyone to save for a home - and considering the absolutely pitiful job growth, the fact that wages aren't rising, and the predilection for a lot of small business owners to only hire within their ethnic group (controversial - but it's true and you know it, even if you don't wanna say it), we are caught in a very, very nasty Catch-22.Personally, despite the fact that I'll probably never own any home other than a caravan - and I'm well into middle-age - I sort of can't wait for the bubble to burst and end this orgy of greed that's changed Australians from a fairly easy-going bunch  twenty-five years ago into a nation of mean-spirited, aggressive, highly-stressed paranoid jerks. When I came back from travelling in Asia I was stunned by the pervasive air of anger and aggression and general unfriendliness that fills Melbourne - and I can't imagine many places here have managed to evade the same malaise.Maybe a very hard slap in the face will wake this nation lost in an illusion of privilege and entitlement up to reality.What we need to do is change the way housing works, and start creating communal housing, everywhere, not just in enlightened rural areas. The kibbutz system is a perfect blueprint - not for everyone maybe, but I think you'd have a massive show of hands for it, given the hard-nosed pointlessness of the system as it is.

There's an alarming lack of respect and absence of manners and good will. Unfortunately, we live in an era in which a particular kind of superficially intelligent money grubbing individual is ascendent. I'm just amazed that so many people have signed up to this funless dog eat dog mode of existence in which money is everything and the wonder of life is taken for granted. My current theory is that it will take another catastrophe such as a world war to make people come to their senses. Not sure that a world war might do for housing prices though, given that most Australian cities will be nuked and rendered unliveable for the half life of strontium 90.

08 Jun 2015 10:11:53amHigh demand CAUSES high prices. Reduce the demand and the prices will come down or not go up so fast.Negative gearing is a strong contributor to this. With out negative gearing people would be purchasing houses to live in. Those who purchase for reasons of negative gearing push the price up, the cost is less of a consideration the tenants will be paying off the mortgage. In a climate where the lending rates are low it is an easy way to make money when you have a surplus of money. No effort required just part with the initial amount then watch it come back via tenants and the ATO.That money would be better used to reverse climate change and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and the Middle east. putting your head in the sand will not make it go away.

08 Jun 2015 11:16:30amHigh demand is high occupancy rates... I have previously negative geared and I can't imagine anyone who would buy into a low rental demand. Negative gearing assumes growing rental demand which result in higher rents and the decision between rent or buy will increase house prices.

08 Jun 2015 8:06:47amIan Verrender, are you serious? The prices are driven by the combination of supply and demand. If the Chinese buyers you refer to have moved to Australia to live, then they are Australians. That contributes to higher demand for housing and if the supply can't keep up in the short term, the prices will be bid upwards. But note, the buyers are Australian residents, like the rest of us. Supply can lag demand in Australia because of our town-planning constraints and restrictive labour laws.If the buyers are overseas investors, they have not in any way changed the demand for housing and will have zero impact on the prices.

08 Jun 2015 8:47:23amDavid, our Chinese friends that our children grew up with tell us otherwise. They tell us its about getting their "under the table" money out of China. Try buying off the plan.

08 Jun 2015 11:08:45amAbsolutely, Algernon. I never understood how land can be opened up, developed or released to relieve housing shortages in our big cities and the planned new builds are then flogged off the plan to foreign buyers. Valuable land is lost, the housing shortage is not addressed (only made worse) and prices are rising. Great for developers, frustrating for Australians who want to get into the market, a joke played on us by real estate agents who continue to sell properties (even if they are excisting dwellings) even to foreign students who pave the way for the rest of their families immigrating through the back door. Agents who don't comply with foreign investment guidelines should be stripped of their licence and fined silly. No-one is enforcing anything and we keep on building in prime locations - for others. There are loopholes galore and foreigners are stampeding through them. It doesn't help when agents hold auctions or sale shows in Chinese ignoring the local buyer but it sure doesn't help when regulations about foreign ownership are there but constantly ignored.

08 Jun 2015 10:25:01amTo reiterate, the owner of the house is irrelevant to the price. Whether it is an owner occupier or an grey-nomad investor or overseas investors, the owner is irrelevant because the relationship between supply and demand has not changed. The price of a BHP share is not affected by who buys it. (The extra demand by a keen investor is exactly offset by the extra supply of a happy seller.) For house prices, what does matter is the number of Australians needing a roof over their heads relative to the supply.

08 Jun 2015 8:09:12amThank you Ian for a very informative article. It does seem that the Govt. continue to fiddle while Rome may well start to burn & when it does it will a very hard fire to extinguish.The way we are going it seems inevitable that unemployment will rise & when it does defaults on home loans will start. At present a lot of home buyers are having great difficulty in maintaining their loan repayments & as a result they have very little money left over for other purchases, so this will be reflected in small business finding it difficult to keep open, even after Hockey's small business tax adjustments.Big business has locked itself into paying big dividends lately & as a result they have very little left for updating equipment & expanding the business. That means they are unlikely to increase employment, in fact may well reduce it.All these factors don't look good for the economy & the Govt. just don't seem to be aware of it. In fact one economist was interviewed on TV last week saying he is tipping a recession within 18 months & the housing bubble & huge price rises really accomplish absolutely nothing in the long run, but will be devastating in a recession.

As has been reported, many of these purchases are left empty. How many million Chinese purchasers are still lining up to purchase is a question nobdy knows, but allowing this distortion to affect our national affairs indefinitely is unacceptable. I support Government action as foreshadowed. Suggesting inflated property prices here are due to "Inlexible labour market" is code for "create a sub-class of workers". That road is more potentially destructive to our Australian identity and way of life than the arrival of foreign nationals, about which there seems so much anxiety.Above all else, I reject the Big Australia notion. Bigger city populations have an outflow to regional areas. An unending plague of human activity is all bad news for our unique and wonderful wildlife.

08 Jun 2015 9:02:55amI would put it to our correspondent and to readers that house prices are not the problem because in places like middle suburban Sydney, where I live, most of the houses sold are knocked down and replaced by dual and sometimes multi occupant dwellings.  What is valuable is the land on which our houses sit. The houses are not worth a brass razoo.My suburb, along with many others around here are fast losing their character and purpose.  No longer are there sweeping lawns, carefully maintained gardens and mature trees that make for a pleasant living environment.  Now we have close packed houses where the main view is of the neighbours bedrooms, of concrete driveways, token grass verges and toy gardens.  Our streets are packed out with cars because these new houses really only allow parking for a single car, whereas the reality is that most houses are now 2, 3 or more car homes.The developers are running riot.  They make huge profits from ruining our neighbourhoods and care not a whit about it.  Our state government is hooked on the windfall taxes and charges and are urging the developers on. "Investors" are piling in hoping to make a quick quid before the whole rotten thing collapses in on itself.  Let the bubble burst.  We will all suffer, especially those of us who have lost the living environments that we carefully natured and maintained over generations. But the thing is, after all the pirates have gone we will still be here trying to restore sanity and peace to our wounded suburban environments.

08 Jun 2015 9:29:51amYou missed the white picket fences. You do realise your average house has a lifespan of around 50 years. I have no problems with them being knocked down, more a problem with the architectural disasters that replace them.I'd be more concerned about the build of some of these new houses. Around the corner a small townhouse development. Poured the concrete on the Friday. frames up the following Monday. Brickwork mostly finished on the Friday. Work started 10 days before Christmas.

08 Jun 2015 12:34:57pmI dunno about the 50 year lifespan bit. Our house was built  by experienced tradesmen. It is 1950ish with hardwood bearers, joists, frames and floors.  It is still straight and has not moved in all that time (but we have kept the maintenance up.)  Modern "nails" just bend on contact. It's still good for another 50 years or so.I do agree with you on the new builds.  Down the road two townhouses were slapped up in record time by a bunch of cowboy builders. Green softwood prefab frames, nail guns, on uncured concrete, ply wood stiffeners and veneer brickworks... They were sold on to investors for nigh on $1M each but at the first real rain we had they flooded downstairs because the builders had not bothered to put in proper drainage to divert the surface water.  I understand the owners are still trying to get compensation from the builder who is a long time gone.  I think you are right about the lifetime of these new buildings but I doubt if some of them will last even for the seven or so years you suggest.  Lots of frustrations, hidden costs and tears to come I reckon. I can think of a number of better ways to invest a million bucks.

08 Jun 2015 2:42:04pmThe 50 year lifespan is a bit of a generalisation. Our house is much the same and we keep up the maintenance. solid brick construction with rendered walls. Yet there will be firo constructed houses that are near the end of their lives. The maintenance as well a proper construction is the real issue.

08 Jun 2015 9:04:26amChinese nationals should not be able to spend more than $50,000 on property in Australia without demonstrating where they got the money, for a start. However, the government needs to put a low lid on what any foreigner can spend on property here, whether buying one or more. I'd suggest a cap of about $400,000.Some areas of Australia now have more than 70% of all home sales going to Chinese nationals and many areas have auctions only conducted in Mandarin, which must be illegal if one considers that it immediately locks most local people out of the bidding. Sorry, but I have no interest in living in the new state of China South, which is what this government and the idiotic governments before them have been busy creating.

08 Jun 2015 9:06:51amAustralia's housing costs have been high for a number of decades now as the ratio of housing median price to average yearly earnings will attest, that ratio far higher than what it is in comparable countries, one report a few years back showing it was 6:1 as against 3:1 for the US/Canadian markets.If our ratio was tracked against the rough doubling/trepling of our population in the last half century or so, that could likely reveal something else of the demand side.Then of course there is the McMansion expectations of younger generations as against what was acceptable housing many decades ago and the commitments and sacrifices that went with or does not go with expectations in current times.No doubt the love by migrants and others to live in capital cities and the ever willingness of governments at all levels to  love developments in already far too heavily developed areas just adds to demand and so no surprise that more and more people cram into apartments and onto crowded monstrous motorways that are then near empty for about 50% of time, both creating particular traits within our communities.So life goes on and changes with time, the changes far from being an improvement in quality of life." But the enormous gains of the past two years, which clearly has the new Treasury head concerned, will ensure the next decline will be anything but orderly. "I wonder whether something similar will be written every ten years or so as the capital cities just become more and more populated because our governments and developers seem to be immune from creating anything different.Thankfully, there are still many places in Australia where life can be far different.

There is also a different story, the Chinese are now a part of Australia, they go into commerce, people expect them to do that, they go into government, people expect that too.

08 Jun 2015 4:18:38pmWell most roads, drains and parks are provided by the developers. Libraries, aged care facilities etc are heavily subsidised by state and federal government. Most LGA's would be bankrupt (many already are) of they weren't subsidised.What your talking about cost wise is maintenance. The costs are very cheap for what is provided. Mind you most LGA's are little more than sheltered workshops.Our LGA is jacking up the rates 7% above and beyond CPI. I had no problem with that the presented a case by letter to all ratepayers. Yet we're getting reduced services as a result which is against what they presented to ratepayers. Liberal controlled what would you expect.
Alert moderator
08 Jun 2015 9:27:34pmNo actually I was thinking principally of depreciation not maintenance. New infrastructure is provided by developers (more likely funded by them via Section 94 contributions).Council's have to fund the renewal of depreciating assets. Developers don't do that. And of course the new assets start depreciating immediately and that needs to be funded too. And that is huge. Depreciation (infrastructure backlog) is why councils are allegedly going bankrupt.In most cases operating the asset (sweeping roads or clearing SQIDS) costs more than the maintenance (filling a pothole or relining a small section of drain). As a general rule depreciation > operating > maintenance.About 5% of your councils operating income (i.e. excluding those developer contributions) is from grants.You'll also find most of the grant funding is for State mandated services. For example pensioner rebate subsidy is large but in reality it is only making up for half of the income councils lose in pensioner rates rebates. The RMS will provide a large capital grant but that is to renew council owned secondary roads vital to the Sydney network. Or implement the RMS' cycle way plan. The RMS provides large operating grants like the Traffic Route Lighting Subsidy (again) to operate the road network on its behalf. I can assure you council costs in providing aged service on behalf of the State exceed the grant. A condition of the funding is that councils prove this every year. And if the grant was not forthcoming, councils could/would cease providing the service on the State's behalf. IPART makes this hard to understand with its arcane rituals but your council did not get an increase 7% above CPI. It got a 7% increase above its 14-15 permissible income. That is a 4.6% increase of the rate peg it would have got anyway. The rate peg is set with reference to a Local Government Price Index less an efficiency dividend. For 15-16 this was 2.6% - 0.2% = 2.4%Bad news for you (or good depending on your perspective) is that they get to do it again in the three following years. Your council's application and the IPART determination (each available on-line) specifically mention increased service levels. Your council will have to report on these increased service levels for the next ten years. Provision of infrastructure is a service. Renewing infrastructure in an unacceptable condition is therefore increasing service levels.

09 Jun 2015 8:42:28amMost Councils into the Urban areas of NSW have their heads above water. West of the divide I think its three that aren't close to bankrupt. They have huge road networks to maintain and declining or little population to maintain them. I've just returned from WA where there are LGA's with maybe 1000 or 1500 population, how on earth are they even viable. There are some councils in Rural NSW not much bigger than that the same questions could be asked.I see maintenance and depreciation as the same thing really. All things depreciate in value. Look after them and you'll get more life from them. Eventually they need to be replaced. Our council has taken to removing play equipment from many of the lesser parks, leaving a dull vista with a bubbler. The only people using them now are those with the mower or the slasher. I understand the removal is a value v benefit.Local councils are not efficient, they tend to employ the dregs. I've dealt with most professionally I'd count on one hand those that are run well. To this end I see the forced amalgamation of councils as a good thing. Abolish the states and local government then introduce regional government would be even better.

09 Jun 2015 9:17:17amWell I maintain my Toyota to its service schedule and it still depreciates. You might be right re depreciation and maintenance but that doesn't matter. Because the OLG, the Sampson review and now the Fit for the Future say different and their the criteria councils have to meet. They have separate maintenance and renewal ratios.But here, let me support your concerns. There's no consistency across councils regarding asset valuation and useful life. I believe engineers are overstating backlogs. Usually due to rigid application of formal standards, sometimes as ambit claims for capex budgets. If depreciation is too high councils will therefore perform unnecessary renewals to manage their ratios

People will talk.I am not trying to tell Mr Verrender that he is wrong, (for once on a Monday), but I don't think that there are many landlords around who can see the obvious, because they're not paying rent for the privilege of staying out of institutions or other terrestrial plots.There is also one reasonable blot on our national economic history which indicates that wages have to some degree dictated rents, for about 15 years, just starting to float back down again, and apparently it's all China's fault because they won't pay $180 per tonne for Australian dirt anymore.However which way we try, the Chinese will decide who gets rich in this country, and price they pay to get it.

08 Jun 2015 10:19:23amThere's two really bad pieces of policy here, the 5 million foreign investment, and superannuation.  Ian has also drawn attention to it being illegal to take 50000 out of China and the casino issue.It isn't the Chinese launderers fault they see an opportunity but it is directly effecting our quality of life .Well now that it has been clearly spelt out   both parties need to end this and the best way is to lower the cost of rent . If self funded retiree's wish to invest in property the rental equation needs to be heavily in the tenants  favour. The investor still has the security of real estate with a less volatile[speculative ] environment. All superannuation should go into low yield local development initiatives that are government guaranteed with a great big anchor to lower risk, our gas reserves. The other great hole in our personal outgoings  is the cost of energy. Gas should be seen as a temporary measure with a good percentage of its revenue going into renewable initiatives.This single act can lower wages increase  and production costs and put the brakes on the daily  massive flow of our money heading overseas, wasted money that has to be found in everyone's wage.  Addiction to growth at all costs being both parties vice has fuelled this problem and what a weak solution to mining boom income soaring house prices is.

08 Jun 2015 10:19:27amAn excellent and hard-hitting article, Ian. The problem is not confined to residential property, it extends to industrial/commercial property as well. Adding to the inflated property pricing problem is the expectation of many industrial/commercial property owners that they are still entitled to 10-12% returns on property. 2% is more realistic in todays low-interest world. High i/c property rents and values add a huge burden to small business operators costs. Thus they have major problems competing. We are definitely entering dangerous territory, and I'm personally predicting that within 5 years, we will see a "perfect storm" of low tax receipts from low commodity prices, coupled with struggling manufacturing/small business/tourism sectors failing to make major profitability increases (as the Reserve Bank is regularly predicting) - all combining with a serious property price crash, to bring recession with a capital R, to our fair country.

08 Jun 2015 6:08:09pmI think you're right Trump. The extraordinary level of paper losses held by negative gearers (particularly those idiots who've just got on board in the last few years of an inflated market) are hugely exposed to a 'correction' in house prices. When this correction occurs (as I'm sure it will: our fundamental economic indicators are not good), there will be a lot of people forced to sell quickly, and probably at a loss. The only upside is that it will be good for those first home buyers who just keep missing out at the moment. And any brake on  Chinese money (which seems a likely scenario given the electorate's fury in various pockets of suburbia) will see a huge chunk of demand withdrawn.While perhaps not so large in the aggregate, there are various suburbs in Melbourne where houses are sold almost exclusively to Chinese nationals, and you'd have to be a bit dim to think that the payment for a $2m house sold in these circumstances was entirely legitimate given the $50K cash export rule in China. The Chinese government seem to be shutting down one corrupt pathway after another (the Macau casino scam being the latest), so I guess there's hope, but whichever Australian party gets onto this real-estate scam first is onto a real vote winner. And they don't even have to change policy, they just need to enforce it - although it begs the question: what the hell have the FIB public servants been doing for all these years, not to mention the crime comission who should have been tracking this dodgy funding from the outset? My guess is that they've been (via the politicians) under the direction of the developers and property industry, and were effectivley allowed to skive off on enforcement. Anything that makes a public servant's day easier is an extremely easy de facto policy to implement, and we have as a consequence findings like the one that said there'd been only 1 or 2 foreign investment rejections in the last few years.

08 Jun 2015 11:43:22amA lot of basics seem to be ignored hereThe rents in Sydney and Melbourne are at those levels because there are enough renters willing and able to pay them. Simple supply and demand.The supply (number constructed) of rental properties is in turn driven by the prices developers can get for those properties. If the prices fall, developers will be less willing to supply so availability drops.If availability drops, the lesser number of rentals will be sought after more fiercely - and rents will go up!Negative gearing, by it's very definition, means that rent is charged at a loss. If negative gearing is abolished, prices will fall, but the rent will now be charged at no loss, so at a higher percentage rate of the value.The combination of reduced supply and rent at a higher percentage of the property value may well result in both higher rents with a greater shortage of rentable properties. Be careful of what you wish for - you might actually get it.I do not have, and have not ever managed to have a negatively geared property.

08 Jun 2015 12:11:07pmIn the 1950s there was a severe housing shortage in NSW and some young families were living in tents.The government built lots of "Commission" homes. It didn't ruin the builders because they didn't care who was paying for houses that they built.It didn't stop private home building, because those who had enough cash still invested in building their own.The biggest problem was some public housing tenants went on to be business owners or amassed unusually high wealth and sponged on the state by paying low rent, as they still do today.

08 Jun 2015 12:23:08pmA couple of thoughts on this:As long as state governments fill their coffers with stamp duty on property sales there is little incentive for things to change. Was this not one of the taxes GST was meant to abolish?  It is like the funding from poker machines/gambling - sure it raises revenue but what are the other costs to society?  e.g.,  if affordable housing existed in the market would government housing be in such demand?  What sense does it make to allow foreign investors first dibs on new property? How many first home buyers and downsizers are squeezed out by this idea?  Let the investors be in the construction companies, etc. not the end product.   (And yes concur with a prior comment that these projects and sales are targeted directly to overseas buyers - locals don't even get a look in.)  Let's see what Walsh Bay ends up like.Why are SMSF allowed to borrow to buy real estate?  These changes fueled investor borrowing and raised rents. Many inner city existing dwellings that were owner occupied are now caught in this revolving door of renters as higher and higher rents are needed. And neighbourhoods and communities are the losers.  It would be interesting to see some stats on investor loans, and investment property purchases that are for SMSFs.Perhaps a FIFA style investigation into money laundering globally in property markets is what is really needed.

08 Jun 2015 1:52:39pmVery good points SS. It was indeed a major flaw that stamp-duty survived GST implementation.But I fear that there are too many of our international leaders with feet in the trough for any genuine analysis at that level, and too many of our national leaders with snouts in the generous tax trough applied to property nationally, for any real change to be affected here. Look at the register of financial interests of members of Parliament.......

08 Jun 2015 12:34:21pmThere is huge in investment at the top end of the market using negative gearing because it is the icing on the cake, because it is available.There is a substantial number of middle and lower market investors who don't use negative gearing because they don't have the use for it.For those people who haven't done any homework on the negative gearing issue, I suggest that you don't rely on the rented property statistic to calculate the sum that could be retained by government if Negative Gearing was stopped forthwith.Lastly, I have no rented property.

08 Jun 2015 12:49:59pmIf the people who have been harping on about government red tape causing a shortage were right then we wouldn't see the recent increase in time homes are on the market before being sold. I think demand has fallen because the prices are unaffordable.When property prices started booming around 20 years ago everyone jumped on board as a means of getting rich. The people who got there in time have made a killing but unfortunately the popularity of greed has driven this problem further because of the constant investor driven demand which I think it only now starting to drop off in some areas.I think we need to carefully make changes which will reduce the incentives which will keep the prices going without causing everyone to lose their money. The problem is most of us have a vested interest in the prices going up. Maybe it is starting to correct naturally if people are struggling to sell.

08 Jun 2015 12:53:33pmI am curious. Does the Australian government document purchases and the price Chinese investors pay for housing here and then share it with the Chinese government so they can investigate if money laundering is occurring. Or do all those countries being affected just complain without showing the offending nation's government who is sneaking money out of China.I think a good sharing agreement would reduce illegal purchases and probably result in China being able to bust quite a few criminal organisations. Anyone know if this type of information sharing is happening?
Alert moderator
08 Jun 2015 6:18:00pmI don't know that the information sharing you describe is being done, although it should be. The Chinese government have however been identifying and finding ex-Chinese nationals suspected of corrupt activity in Australia and putting pressure on the Australian government to help them in their activities. In the interests of our relationship with China, and closer ties our government should be co-operating with the Chinese officials, and I would support in any way the extradition requests that arise. It beggars belief that there is not huge amounts of corrupt or stolen money behind the real estate boom in Australian cities. One way to fix things would be to reverse the onus of proof on real estate purchases. Given the $50K threshold for removing money from China, it would be reasonable to expect potential buyers to first prove that their money is legitimate - I would fully expect this to result in a collapse in Chinese real estate investment in Australia. And we should get rid of our cash-for-citizenship deals. They can only but attract large numbers of corrupt individuals. Canada did it after the ruination (for the locals) of the Vancouver property market - this policy change is behind the recent exploding growth in Chinese investment in Australia.

08 Jun 2015 1:15:13pmBut to Erick's point with its helpful punctuative pointers.council rates ,land tax , property insurance ,body corperate fees ,utility chargesThese things have also contributed to the rise in house prices. We should assume that as nobody has not been greedy in this situation, all of those costs rose because they could. But Erick is talking about apartments, not houses. I remember the government telling some tale about how they could not have predicted that people would game the superannuation system. And I suppose nobody could have predicted that the property market would boom either. But it would be interesting to see if council rates, land taxes, property insurance, body corporate fees and utility charges rise in anticipation of land prices rising in an area. And it would be interesting to ask the government why it profits off opportunistic trading. And it would be interesting to ask the government why it forgets to mention when it does make a profit.

08 Jun 2015 1:57:38pmIt seems self interest rules as far as our politicians and other wealthier people are concerned.  There are some ways government could change the game in real estate such as treating the family home as a taxable asset with capital gains tax applying and assessing the home for welfare purposes or not allowing a deduction in excess of income on an investment property but allowing the losses to be carried forward until such a time as the property makes a bigger profit, but this will not happen when there are so many vested interests involved in maintaining the status quo.There no doubt will be a day of reckoning.

The chinese, for the price of a house, get house, visa, education, schoool, healthcare, money laundry. The Ozzies of all ethnicities only get the house. This means it is not a fair policy. It is a very very bad unfair policy. Sydney will be owned by China soon. In China they build cities of 30 million every month. Buying out a tiny city like Sydney, and all the supply chains of food and minerals, is childs play, particularly with government officials who stand to make a short term quick buck from stupid policies like teh Significant Investor. Sydney will soon be owned by China. FACT. The only question is whether there will be any push back. And looking at our stupid government I doubt it. Pack your bags ladies and gents.

08 Jun 2015 2:45:19pmjims,The argument you promote assumes that if negative gearing is abolished house prices will fall.  That may or may not be true.  It will certainly shut out those "investors" who are relying upon the ATO to subsidize their losses in order to service loans.  Negative gearing only works if you lose money - which is a pretty dumb investment strategy unless you are convinced capital gains will outstrip the losses in time and can afford to sustain the losses until you eventually sell.   Assuming capital gains will continue to occur when property prices are at an all time high and Australian property is also at an all time high relative to other countries has to be a high risk strategy.If rents increase it will result in overcrowding.  As I observed in my student days in the UK in the late 1970's / early 1980's, immigrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh would often crowd 2 or 3 families into a "flat" = "unit", in order to share the cost of the rent.  The same will happen in Australia, since wages are not rising fast enough to cover any significant increase in rent costs.And that in turn imposes major additional loads on infrastructure such as sewers, water supplies, stormwater drainage, power supplies, roads etc. for which they were not designed.This is already becoming an issue in some suburbs due to knocking houses down and putting up "six packs" by developers.  The infrastructure is being overloaded and there is not enough room on the roads for the cars.It will only get worse if we create a situation where overcrowding is inevitable due to higher rents.Despite the short term political argy bargy, being realistic if negative gearing is abolished it will create more problems for society as a whole than it will resolve.  We need to look at what the average family / couple can realistically afford and build sustainable housing to meet that budget.  For a whole host of reasons it will not be the McMansion on a quarter acre block they desire, but it will be a roof over their heads.And abolishing negative gearing will result in inequities in tax administration, since why abolish it for this particular asset but allow it for others?

08 Jun 2015 3:05:05pmI wonder if some interest rate volatility would help here?Instead of being flat, why not have a rise, cut, rise, cut in interest rates?This creates bad conditions for short term capital gains chasing, and leaves longer term investment fairly unharmed.

08 Jun 2015 3:06:00pmIan, Another informative and thought provoking dissertation on a potential housing bubble.Try buying property in China! But if you are Chinese for $5m you can not only buy Australian property but Australian citizenship with the uncontested approval of the Chinese government. How many of these people could potentially be involved in spying activities and a danger to national security on a scale far greater than individual Australian citizens fighting in the Middle East and North Africa and where revocation of citizenship is potentially at the mercy  of a doctrinaire Federal Minister and not a Court of Law.When you are approaching an economic, social and environmental iceberg  in the aftermath  of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and you know it, what do you do as a government in power? You should change course instinctively and offer a practical plan of specific measures that revolve around common sense and intuition that broaden and strengthen the economy sustainably into the future. You might even contemplate quantitative easing if necessary according to global circumstances and follow the EU, Japan and US with the distinct likelihood given a lack of global clout your currency would go into free fall and where you would require a broad, diversified, industrial and services based economy capable of maintaining self sufficiency for a period of time...provided it had not been too far compromised by government policy prescriptions based on draconian austerity.

If the PM disagrees, just ask him for pay $200 for a basic meal.  Any questions should be countered with, price and affordability are different issues.  There is not one party that has a plan to make housing affordable.  Probably the ministers have too much invested in the housing market already.

08 Jun 2015 10:37:21pm"There is not one party that has a plan to make housing affordable."There is a good reason for this. No matter what you do, it is impossible for several reasons.Assuming Government were to attempt this by changing tax treatment or some other way (such as first home owner grants), desirable properties would always be more affordable for some than others. You can increase the means of the less well off all you like, but someone will just outbid them. And if the vendor isn't getting what they think they should because Government has forced prices down, they just won't sell. There is no alternative, you buy what you can afford. If you can't afford what you want, well there is always renting.

08 Jun 2015 4:00:49pmWrong again.  Housing is facing a supply problem not a demand problem.  The supply shortage is a result of the restrictions on outer-suburban land development imposed by State governments, usually in an attempt to mollify Green voters living in expensive inner city housing.

Four families can reside on an 860sq metre block, get to work in 15 mins on existing public transport and utilize existing services without huge extra costs to government. Bizarre planning laws that demand articulated fronts and setbacks on upper floors are making apartments smaller but more expensive. Empowered do-gooders with no real insight into the costs their vindictive objections cost developers and future unit owners nor do they care but when it comes to selling their own 1/4 land and weatherboard they never complain when a developer pays $1.5 Million for it do they?

People expect to enter the property market at the same level of creature comforts as the previous generation or two now have, but who have worked say 50 years to get where they are. Also of course, a property in the same metro area now has far more facilities/ access that the same property had 50 years ago. So we need to compare what houses were like say in 1960s, 70s say and then find the equivalent house now as the real point to compare pricing.  GR

09 Jun 2015 9:59:38amTo compare apples to apples you compare what proportion of income must be used to pay a mortgage now as opposed to 50 years ago. That proportion is now a lot higher than it used to be and it applies to double income families which used not to be the case. All of which means in real terms housing is much more expensive than it used to be.

09 Jun 2015 9:31:05amIncreasing density also creates future slums. Visit any typical Asian city and you'll understand my point - decaying high rise buildings with high crime rates and laundry hanging on the balconies.  This is the future of these concrete jungles that Lend Lease and others are creating.For a developer, this market is easy. Option a piece of land that is zoned high density residential, subject to preselling 50% of the units. Get an architect and cut him in for some equity, and have him draw up a set of plans and submit them to the council for preliminary development approval. Then do a website, a rendering, maybe a 'model unit', and appoint a sales agent with offices in China, and you are off to the races. The financing can be lined up with 20% cash equity and 50% of the units being presold. When the units are sold the cash down payment is released to the developer and he applies that to his financing commitment, and when the agent has exchanged contracts for the 50% minimum presales the developer's construction financing kicks in, the building is built, and in two years the buyers will be asked to pay the balance - typically they sell the property prior to completion and pocket the profit. What's fun is that when the market turns south (which it will) and the unit prices decline by the 10% or 20% from where the buyer agreed to pay, he is now underwater on the purchase and has no reason to settle, choosing instead to walk away. That's when the real fun starts, the developers have to auction the units that don't close and the prices are driven down further.Yes, we're in a bubble - a severe one, and when the correction comes it will be fun. Bloody for the speculators from China who never intended to occupy the property, but great for cashed up buyers who might pick up a property at prices 20% below present levels.

09 Jun 2015 9:48:19amReal inflation is a lot higher than the Government claims,   and house prices reflect that.If you want to know what real inflation is,  look at Glenn Steven's and the pollies' pay rises.

09 Jun 2015 9:50:42amWhile all of the above has contributed in one way or antoher since 2010, lets not forget that the "boom" in house prices has been going since the late 90's.....There was a policy called the first home buyers scheme which coincided with all those reality shows about buying a dump, spending $40k on it and turning it over for a $50k profit.The in thing was to go and duy a dump in a decent area, DIY and then live in it for 6 months (to be able to claim the First Home Buyers grant) and then sell it in the hope of big profits.In our area, you could see the houses most popular for this as they would be re-sold 3 to 4 times with in 7-9 years but were always different (fence, no fence, brick, rendered yellow, rendered grey etc.)Don't be destracted by the current "us v them" approach from the government, the bulk of the problem is home grown through policy and peoples desire for a quick buck.I purchased my first home in 97 and sold it for twice the price in 08 and I can tell you that in our area, there are no rich Chinese buying property but there are a lot of "dumps" being turned over at a regular pace.Having watched the show last night about Chinese buying houses, they were all the multi million dollar mansions on the bays of Sydney & Melbourne....are we realy saying this is what's making the domestic 3 bedroom too pricey for the average joe?

09 Jun 2015 9:57:35amWhat this Country needs is the ability for the Reserve Bank and the Government to be able to deem the interest rates and negative gearing policies of individual parts of Australia. So if you want to borrow 3 million dollars to buy in Sydney then you don't get the low interest rates the rest of Country enjoys. Nor are you able to negatively gear certain types and/or locations ie Sydney. Problem solved.

09 Jun 2015 10:13:31amChina will acquire Australia. FACT. Its an unstoppable historical force. The only question is how fast and how cheaply, aided and abetted by our ahistorical short sighted and frankly stupid politicians. We are resource rich, small population. THey are overcrowded. The US will not come to our rescue, they are stretched to thin. We were colonized by the British. Soon to be by the Chinese.  We may wish it were by the US which have a free press, institutions, civil rights, laws, courts.....Get used to it folks. China (all companies affiliated with their CCP ) knows this and is, without force is acquiring, residential property, stocks, supply chains, mines, all the arable land left to buy, and our politicians with trinkets and beads to get them to give them "free trade" secret deals which expedite the sell off faster and at a lower price.

09 Jun 2015 10:44:25amreal estate speculators are a major part of the problem.   They do nothing but increase the costs for 1st home owners.   I consider trading in real estate to make money as a crime against the community as an whole, especially the less fortunate.   Housing is too important to be left to speculators to control/plunder the market.

09 Jun 2015 11:01:42am"the next decline will be anything but orderly."But it appears that investors also now trust that  the government of the day will try to make it orderly by rescuing investors from the consequences of their stupidity, with yet more government handouts, designed by the various self-interested lobby groups, that infest Canberra and our national economy.If punters fear the worst and want a truly sustainable return on their investment, why not try self-education and well managed technological innovation?You will be doing both yourself and future generations a favour.  Without some genuine productivity enhancements leading to some new jobs, you risk having your hard-earned buckaroos tied up in a house in a run-down mining town, where the rent does not cover your rates and the other costs of ownership.Hasn't anyone else noticed that the net recurrent yield on a rental property has been rapidly approaching zero, over the past 20 years of negative gearing and easy credit?Meanwhile, a group of smart, tech-savvy kids are quietly creating the future, with some very nice profits to boot.Strength to their arm!

09 Jun 2015 11:07:26amI don't understand fully what you are saying, Ian, but I think you are blaming the laws, both in Australia and in China for the bubble in  housing and that both governments should "do something"!Do what? Chinese laws are all deliciously designed with a fiddle factor and if we are to integrate with Asia we are going to have to learn to live with things of this nature.You are starting to sound like Kevin Donnelly, the religious doctor, with your "it's not right " sort of moralityOne way to impact on housing prices is to make inroads into wages. As an incipient part of Asia our wages structure needs to be more in line with those of our neighbors and we have an average weekly wage of about $1300 a week. Indonesia has an average wage of about $40 a week and Taiwan about $300 a week. Most Asian countries are somewhere in between.....but of course we can hardly be looking at a wage of $300 a week when our dole is that much.It won't be a magic wand, there will still be wealthy Asians looking at our well ordered business culture and laws, but I can't see a way around it except to be more like the Asians that we are........ geographically at least.Just go figure.

09 Jun 2015 11:19:03amThe whole miserable disaster that is housing affordability is the fault of government and government alone.End of story.They brought in negative gearing and left it there for decades so that the damage it does to home affordability would be horrific.They started the first home owners grant which automatically added that amount to the cost of a new home.They never release enough land causing an artificial shortage of supply. Only a truly deeply disconnected and incompetent set of governments would follow policies that made land a commodity in short supply in a country the size of Australia. They decided to cut back on the amount of public housing. They encouraged foreign investors!!!!!

09 Jun 2015 11:50:41amHaving visited europe a few times i really like the "idea" of high density cities with low density farm land. It makes so much sense. However...We are the legacy of grandparents that had their pwn vegie patch, a couple of chooks and some roses in the garden. I grew up helping my grand dad weed the garden, get the eggs and pick some tomatoes. That was on a small 600m block. I want my kids to have memories of picking vegies, watering the garden, killing snails and knowing where food comes from.How much value do we place on "un-scripted, un-planned non adult controlled kids outdoors time"? This is the problem that cities in australia face. This is the transition from a 1950's garden lifestyle to a 2010's one.

09 Jun 2015 12:25:16pmNo figures to back up your claims Ian?My counter anecdotes.  Third hand I have heard of a major real estate group setting up a separate office to handle Chinese buyers.  They believe those buyers pick up 30% of top end purchases in the Sydney lower north shore area in which they operate.  That proportion would be considerably lower for the mid to low end, particularly in dormitory suburbs, but would not be insignificant just the same taking into account buying by nominees.Super funds can borrow in limited circumstances, yes.  With CGT on long term gains running at 10% for accumulating funds the benefits of negative gearing are less than attractive as far as I am concerned.  For super funds in pension phase, paying no tax, what, are they mad?People buying direct property at these prices in super funds are cruising for a bruising IMO, given the obligations to pay pensions in the medium to short term for so many with large balances in their funds.  Your piece sets off the old BS detector once again I am afraid.

09 Jun 2015 1:28:27pmIt is clear that housing built in Australia is designed for a different climate.We could build houses in Australia suited to the local climate.One concept that I have been pursing can be found Space Design Pty Ltd Dr Sydney Baggs.We can build houses below ground and on top of the ground using earth covered techniques, or various products to simulate the benefits of earth covered housing,of not needing cooling, heating, able to accommodate more people in a smaller area, use of the roof space, healthier buildings and cheaper to build.We need to build these forms of development if we are to work with our environment and enhance native species.Our wild life require growth corridors to survive and our roads completely isolate the majority of plant forms and wild life.So you are going to build a house for Australia. Lets take a Melbourne new outer suburb, though could be done in the inner city area.On your block you install a prefabricated structure special y designed for mass production and dropped on the building site.The structure is then sealed and covered with sand gravel and then soil.The roof is native garden with some exotics,The roof also supports a bubble that contains solar panels, the light goes through a prism to concentrate on the solar panels.The base of the bubble collects water from the garden roof area for redistribution in the garden and toiletry systems.Light wells also open up to inner court yards, assisting in natural air flow through out the building,From the street the house looks like any European house with a faceure and difference becomes noticeable with the garden roof and the continuation of the garden roof to the neighboring house in most applications.The garden roof also extends as a bridge across the roadway and supports pedestrian pathways that at times are also using some of the house roof area.This means that area's such as common pathways now have a new regulation and through design can cross over a property provided privacy is maintained.So earth covered houses a bonded to the ground and the temperature is maintained equal to the temperature of the ground. No heating or cooling required.Air flow is supported through out the building in design so fans are not required,No breeding grounds in walls etc being a problem of the average house built to day, so healthy houses.Large reduction from noise and more secure buildings,Able to accommodate more people in the same suburban block due to all that roof area now garden or play area.Newer thinking in room placement as rooms can be offset in the design and floors can rise in graduations, ideal for wheel chair access as steps are not a requirement to go from a lower level to a higher level.Far cheaper to build and each building can be unique, as they can be landscaped.Ideal for bush fire area's and area's that flood as ea

09 Jun 2015 1:45:34pmIt is funny how the comments start running off from a tangent on what the original article was about, and where it finished.There is a housing bubble.  It has been driven by the things which Ian has identified, and yes, we are heading for a significant correction which may affect the banking industry.Nothing there about children, public transport, green transport options.There is now a lot of Chinese money flowing through, and generallyit is being brought in by Chinese who are Australian citizens, holding Australian passports and paying taxes on their meagre Australian wages, whilst they are being paid significantly more family money from China and then are using that money to buy houses at inflated prices.My turn to go off at a tangent - Has anyone thought that this just may be a deliberate strategy to weaken our economy?  Or is that too far fetched?

09 Jun 2015 2:25:41pmI am concerned that the idea of your house going done in value is a great concern to everyone. We all have to live somewhere and the cost of housing (your mortgage) is only relative to the cost of renting. If all the houses in Australia go down in price you haven't lost anything because comparatively your home remains priced the same as everyone else. It is only if you have two or more properties or expecting a windfall from an inheritance that you may lose some wealth.

09 Jun 2015 3:58:52pmDID YOU KNOW that  people who have recently become permament residents in Australia are eligible for first home buyers grants in many states, provided they meet all the other criteria? if it is their first purchase in australia, they can get this grant regardless of how much property they might already own overseas, or where/how their money came to be in Australia.i know these grants are only a small drop, but its taxpayers money. many thousands per person. i think this needs to be tightened. i personally know of several examples of relatively wealthy recent migrants getting these grants for new houses. this seems very very wrong indeed.
