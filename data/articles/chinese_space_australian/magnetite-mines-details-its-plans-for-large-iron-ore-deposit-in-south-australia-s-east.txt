A mineral exploration company has briefed residents and businesses at Broken Hill in far west New South Wales about plans for what it says is one of the world's largest magnetite iron ore sites.Adelaide-based Magnetite Mines is hoping to tap into a deposit of iron ore at Razorback Ridge, which is part of the Mawson iron ore site that stretches from an area south of Broken Hill to north of Burra in South Australia.Chairman Gordon Toll said the company's next step was to find and secure about $4 billion to mine the deposit, with a feasibility study underway due to be completed in 2017."The starting gun is not dependent on the iron ore market, it's dependent on us getting the finance," Mr Toll said. "We think there's a definite slot right now in the steel world for our product, so it's really all about pre-selling the product and getting the finance."Magnetite Mines said it has been in discussions with the South Australian government and Chinese investors about the project.Mr Toll said the project would be based in Burra and that it could bring employment opportunities Broken Hill residents. "Right at the beginning of any mining project, there's a huge amount of earthwork that needs to be done, and there's earthworks contractors here in Broken Hill," Mr Toll said. "Broken Hill is a mining town, there's lots of skills here, lots of people here that can make a good living out of our project."Broken Hill councillor Darriea Turley said the city needed to push for local involvement."The thing about Broken Hill is we've got the knowledge, we've got the ability, and we've got the staff to do the job, so let's hope there's some opportunities for us," Ms Turley said.Editor's note (16/2/2017) â€“ This story originally reported that Magnetite Mines would begin construction in 2017. However, upon review of the interview with Gordon Toll the story was changed to clarify that the company had plans to complete a feasibility study in 2017.
