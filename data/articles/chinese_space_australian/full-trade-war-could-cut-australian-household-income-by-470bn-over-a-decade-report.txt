An "all-out" trade war could cut Australia's household spending power by almost half a trillion dollars over a decade, global accounting giant KPMG has warned. KPMG modelled the impact of a rapid escalation of hostilities where a substantial number of other countries pile into the conflict and raise tariffs by 15 per cent.In that scenario, KPMG said that over five years Australian GDP would be 2.4 per cent lower than it would have been in the absence of the trade war."The present value of Australia's real [inflation adjusted] losses over the decade is estimated at $364 billion," KPMG said."The present value of the loss in Real Household Disposable Income for Australia is estimated at $474 billion."Real household net disposable income is commonly defined as the sum of household spending on consumption goods as well as household savings, minus the change in net equity of households including superannuation.The measure has been driven higher in recent years by Australia's rising terms of trade, or the amount of goods that can be imported per unit of export goods.The boom in mineral exports has boosted profits, helped support wages in the resources sector and filled up Treasury coffers with taxes and royalties — all of which has broadly increased national and household wealth.The almost half a trillion dollar loss of national income over a decade represents the equivalent of 40 per cent of last year's total household disposable income. KPMG Australia chief economist Brendan Rynne said around 60,000 jobs would be lost, and real wages pushed down by $16 per week for the average worker."The lesson from our modelling is that no country would win from a global trade war and every country would lose," Mr Rynne said.. "Even in the event of a full-blown trade war between the US and China, it is in the best interests of other countries to stay out of it."Policymakers in Australia and other nations would be well-advised to resist the political pressure to impose or increase tariffs on goods imported from the US and China as they seek new markets."In KPMG's modelling, in the advent of an all-out trade war, China would not fall into recession but its economic growth rate would slow to just 4 per cent a year and would stay below 5 per cent for around five years — rates of growth not experienced for more than 3 decades.The US would be harder hit, according to KPMG. Its GDP loss, at 4.6 per cent, would see the US endure a year-long recession and it would take the best part of a decade for growth to recover to pre-trade war rates.Even then, KPMG argued its modelling was conservative."KPMG Australia has assumed that in this scenario financial markets accommodate the trade war in an orderly fashion," it noted. That is unlikely to happen, according to research from the global investment bank UBS last month.UBS found its view of an "all-out" trade war — where the US and China placed mutual 30 per cent tariffs on all imports — would wreak massive dislocations on global equity markets including the ASX, causing them to fall deep in "bear territory", down more than 20 per cent. Even the more modest, bilateral 10 per cent tariffs on $US200 billion worth of goods expected to be enforced in September are expected to carve around 10 per cent off Wall Street's S&P500 on UBS figures.KPMG said the current situation of the existing 25 per cent tariffs on $US50 billion worth of goods, coupled with next month's expected escalation, would still lower Chinese and US GDP by around 0.6 per cent in four years.Australia's GDP loss would be lower, around 0.3 per cent over four years with losses adding up to around $36 billion over the decade.Scenario 1:US & China impose bilateral 15pc tariffs. No action from other nationsScenario 2:Same as scenario 1 but tariffs raised to 25pcScenario 3:Trade war spills over with all counties imposing 15pc tariffsSource: KPMG Australia
