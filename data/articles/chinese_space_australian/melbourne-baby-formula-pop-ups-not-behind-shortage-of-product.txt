The owners of pop-up shops around Melbourne selling and shipping baby formula to China say they are not behind a shortage of the product, as calls continue for Australian manufacturers to produce more of the in-demand product.Parents have complained publicly about a shortage of their preferred brands of infant formula for months.There have been reports of customers stripping supermarket shelves of formula, and selling the tins online to Chinese customers at an inflated cost.Australian baby formula is so popular some predict the shortage could last another 18 months.Clayton, a suburb in Melbourne's south-east, has at least 10 shopfront which sell and arrange to ship baby formula to China. Among them is Australia SFX Global Express, but store manager James Shi said the business was not responsible for any shortage in infant formula."I don't think we have to take any responsibility, we just run our business, that is what we should do," he said.He also denied newspaper reports the shop had been selling baby formula to Chinese customers only."We don't say we prefer to sell to Chinese," Mr Shi said."Our major customer is from China, yes that is a fact. "We just provide the postal services as well as a product which is very popular."Jan Carey from the Infant Nutrition Council said manufacturers in Australia had already increased production to fill demand."All the manufacturers have increased their supply, and increased their production of formula to the best of their abilities," she said. Australia SFX Global Express also has a shop on Victoria Street in Richmond which has only been open a few weeks.The shop owner there refused a formal interview but said the business had deliberately set up near chemists and supermarkets.The owner added that almost half of the packages he sent to China were milk powder for adults and babies.A woman holidaying in Melbourne arrived at the Richmond shop to send a package to China."My relatives asked me to buy six cans of formula for their baby," she said."When I see plenty of Asian faces taking six or ten cans from the supermarket, I feel it's bad. But I couldn't help it."She added that not just Chinese people were buying the formula, but also those from Korea and India.
