With its economic and inflation forecasts little changed, housing market developments dominated the Reserve Bank's decision to cut interest rates on Tuesday.The bank's governor Glenn Stevens had hinted as much in his statement after the RBA announced a 25-basis-point cut in its cash rate target to a record low 1.5 per cent.However, the bank's quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy has confirmed what a large role Australia's housing market played in the board's deliberations."The board had taken careful account of developments in the housing market, noting the effects of supervisory measures to strengthen lending standards, the easing in housing credit growth and the abatement of strong price pressures," the statement noted.All this suggests that the risks associated with high and rising household sector leverage and rapid gains in housing prices have diminished.In order to conclude that the risks of an east coast housing bubble had dissipated, the Reserve Bank has thrown out a long-standing preference for CoreLogic's (formerly RP Data) figures, and adopted Fairfax-owned APM and the Real Estate Institute of Australia instead."While one source of data recorded strong growth in housing prices in April and May, that growth appears to have been overstated and other sources suggest that housing price growth was modest over those and more recent months," the RBA cooed in its dovish statement.While apparently sanguine about Australia's booming Sydney and Melbourne property markets, the Reserve Bank has turned its focus to China's recently booming residential property sector."Recent falls in residential floor space sold and the slowing in residential construction investment raise some doubts about the durability of the pick-up in demand earlier in the year," the RBA cautioned.Why should it care so much about Chinese real estate? "A substantial slowing in demand in the Chinese property market would pose risks for property developers and related industries, including the steel industry," the RBA answered.For Australia, the potential fallout is two-fold.Directly, many of China's largest property developers are now active in the Australian residential and commercial markets, and the collapse of one or more of them could create substantial losses for those who have pre-purchased, local building contractors and any domestic banks funding the projects.Also, given the uncertain - but clearly high - level of Chinese investment in Australian property, there is also a risk that a property collapse in China might force tome of those buyers to pull out, removing a significant slice of buyer demand and potentially causing an increase in the number of properties for sale.Indirectly, and even more significantly, a significant slowdown in Chinese construction will reduce steel consumption, which in turn will reduce demand and prices for Australian iron ore and coking coal, putting further pressure on shrinking national income.Commodities remain a key feature in Australia's economic picture, with something as simple as a relatively lack of Indian Ocean cyclones proving enough to boost first quarter economic growth nationally."Growth in GDP was stronger than expected in the March quarter, in large part because of a substantial rise in resource exports, which were boosted by unusually favourable weather conditions," the RBA observed."More recent data suggest that real GDP growth was more moderate in the June quarter, as expected."The bank has assiduously avoided any hint of future guidance, with its unchanged forecasts meaning that it may take a further deterioration in either inflation or economic growth to trigger another interest rate cut.
