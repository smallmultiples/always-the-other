A Chinese cladding company will pursue the builder of Australia's most expensive hospital for an additional $9 million, claiming money had been unjustly taken from a bank guarantee. Yuanda Australia — whose parent company Yuanda China Holdings is based in China — was contracted by Hansen Yuncken Leighton Contractors (HYLC) in 2012 to deliver the facade of the Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH) for $58.9 million.In a statement, Yuanda said HYLC had varied its programs during the build, and denied it was the cause of any substantial delays to completing the hospital."HYLC has unjustly made claims for liquidated damages against Yuanda and cashed [a] $4.4 million bank guarantee months after promises to settle the final account," a Yuanda spokesman said."Yuanda has suffered losses close to $5 million for the contract and Yuanda will be taking all necessary steps to seek recovery against HYLC for its breach of contract."The company's commitment to pursue HYLC comes after the South Australian Supreme Court last week upheld the decision of an adjudicator, that HYLC owed Yuanda $1.9 million.Another Federal Court case is open between Leighton Contractors — now known as CBP Contractors — against project consortium Celsus and the South Australian Government.Both parties are currently in arbitration.In results filed with the Australian Securities and Investment Commission for the year to June 2017, Hansen Yuncken recorded a net $14.9 million loss, less than the $55.4 million it recorded in the previous year, amid other claims related to the RAH build.The trouble-plagued hospital was opened in September last year, after initially being slated for completion in April 2016. In the wake of the catastrophic Grenfell Tower fire in London, the South Australian Government and local councils undertook an audit of buildings across the state.In August, the government revealed that the Royal Adelaide Hospital was one of four major buildings that had been identified as containing aluminium composite cladding (ACP).Other buildings included Adelaide Oval, the newly-redeveloped Adelaide Convention Centre and the Women's and Children's Hospital.Despite the identification of ACP, South Australian Planning Minister Stephan Knoll claimed the material in the buildings posed only a low-to-moderate risk.The State Government this week declined to release the list of other buildings identified as ones containing flammable cladding.Hansen Yuncken has been contacted for comment.
