Lunar New Year celebrations are in full swing around the world but for some it can be a time of mixed emotions.The Brisbane suburb of Sunnybank is considered something of an unofficial Chinatown with countless Asian restaurants and food stores.In recent days shops in the area have been a hive of activity as local residents, many of Asian heritage, have frantically prepared to celebrate the Lunar New Year.Miao Wong, originally from China, said the celebration was a chance to expose her four-year-old daughter to her heritage."She's a really lucky girl; I'm from China, my husband is from Australia.... she has contact with Australian culture and Chinese culture," she said."I'm really, really happy to show her the traditional Chinese costumes and she can dress up and look at herself and see how beautiful it is." For newsagency owner Patrick Fung, who migrated to Australia from Hong Kong 20 years ago, the Lunar New Year has lost some of its significance.He said he used to miss being in Hong Kong for the event."For the first few years... yes, but after so many years I don't have any feeling now," he said."Especially we don't have a holiday or anything here."I'm always working for Chinese New Year and the kids go to school." Chie Lam is even busier than normal at work due to the Lunar New Year.As an employee at a Sunnybank barbeque meat business, he has been frantically carving up pork and duck for his customers."People are getting a lot of food they don't want to cook; they just want to go home and have the dinner together," he said. Being in Australia for the Lunar New Year is sometimes difficult for Chinese-born Shelley Gao."We feel a little bit sad but sometimes, when we come to the Sunnybank area and see a lot of Chinese, you can still have a little big of a feeling about Chinese New Year," she said."But still, it's quite different from what we get over at home."Most of the relatives will get together, you get to cook nice food and watch the TV shows and all of that gives you the atmosphere."But here you have to work, and life is normal - it just doesn't feel like a holiday." Taiwanese-born Eric Lin said the Lunar New Year was a great opportunity for him to showcase his traditional calligraphy skills."I really love Brisbane and I love Australia and if I can do something for Chinese New Year or some festival I love to do this," he said."I can introduce this to some people who maybe don't know." Ten-year-old Zhang Junjie, who was born in China but moved to Australia three years ago, said Lunar New Year was a really exciting time for him.However he said he misses his grandparents, particularly at this time of year."I miss the fireworks and stuff... I miss all the busy people on the street and a really lot of people around," he said."[I mostly miss] the lots of people and it's really busy and you can stay awake the whole night to celebrate New Year."
