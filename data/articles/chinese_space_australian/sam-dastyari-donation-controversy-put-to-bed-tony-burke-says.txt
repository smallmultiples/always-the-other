Senior Labor frontbencher Tony Burke has brushed off a call for his colleague Sam Dastyari to provide a more detailed explanation about a donation he accepted from a group with links to the Chinese Government. "Sam Dastyari has very quickly reacted, acknowledged the error and I really think that puts that particular matter to bed," Mr Burke told Lateline.Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi attacked Senator Dastyari in Parliament, saying the payment he received "has the stench of corruption" and there were questions that needed answering.Senator Bernardi made the inflammatory remarks in response to confirmation Senator Dastyari used money donated from a company with links to the Chinese Government to pay an office travel bill.The bill, worth more than $1,600, was sent to a company called Top Education Institute. Senator Dastyari has since acknowledged he should have paid the charges himself and he has donated the same amount of money to charity.Mr Burke downplayed the need to accede to a request from Senator Bernardi for further explanation."If the authority that Sam Dastyari should say more is Cory Bernardi, then I'm prepared to treat that with a grain of salt," Mr Burke said.The revelation comes amid increased attention to the issue of donations to Australian political parties by business in China.Last week, the ABC reported Chinese-linked companies donated more than $5.5 million to both Labor and the Coalition between 2013 and 2015.China's Ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye, has given a rare comment to AM.He was asked why there had been an increase in the number of Chinese businesses donating to Australian political parties."I have no idea, I have no idea what you refer to," he said."For the embassy, we stand ready to work with all parties here in this country to have better relations, to have more fruitful relations based on mutual trust and mutual benefit."
