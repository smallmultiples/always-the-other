We were told Australia was open for business, and yet when a Chinese group bid on S Kidman & Co. estate, Scott Morrison stood in the way and gave us little more than a hazy "national interest" explanation, writes Chris Berg.If it wasn't clear that "the national interest" was a pretty hazy criterion on which to deny foreign investment approvals, then Scott Morrison confirmed it last Friday.The first time the Government rejected a Chinese bid for the S Kidman & Co. estate - Australia's largest private landholding - it was because part of the property, Anna Creek, was next to a sensitive defence site.In fact, some of Anna Creek is in the least important green zone of the Woomera Prohibited Area, which is infrequently used by the Woomera Rocket Testing Range. Nevertheless, the Foreign Investment Review Board was skittish about a Chinese company owning property nearby, so the deal was scuttled in November 2015.The Kidman deal was then restructured to exclude Anna Creek. Last week, Morrison announced that this wasn't enough - the property is just too large to be sold to a Chinese firm. Kidman and Dakang Australia Holdings have until Tuesday to come to another arrangement, otherwise Morrison's "preliminary decision" to prevent the sale will become a permanent decision.It's easy to present the Kidman sale as a big deal. It is, indeed, an enormous collection of properties, spread across Western Australia, South Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland. It was put together in the 1890s by Sidney Kidman, to whom the words "baron" and "legendary" are usually affixed. But the land is in fact some of Australia's least productive. We're talking about desert. The Kidman holdings are enormous because they have to be - to run cattle across such stark landscape you need space.As David Uren pointed out in The Australian over the weekend, S. Kidman & Co wouldn't even rank in a list of Australia's largest 2000 companies. It has nowhere near the largest number of head of cattle of Australian companies. Geographic size isn't everything.Still, you might object, size does matter. But how? Why? Morrison's press release announcing his preliminary decision is completely empty on this point. It states simply that the sale of a property of Kidman's size is not in the national interest.How so? Is it because, as Morrison points out, there are some Australian companies that are interested in the property? This assumes what needs to be shown - that large scale foreign investment is against the national interest, but domestic investment would not be.Usually governments feel the need to offer arguments in defence of their position. Morrison's press release offers no justification - just "the national interest", an empty signifier with no qualification or clarification.If Kidman is sold, the land would remain in Australia, obviously. The property's new foreign owners would be able to do no more or less with it than any Australian owners would.Some have claimed that the sale might result in the loss of Australian jobs, if the new owners brought in Chinese workers. But any Australian purchaser could do the same. The thing that is stopping them is our strict immigration system, and the heavy regulatory constraints around the 457 skilled worker visa program.Simply put, land owned by foreign investors continues to be governed by Australian law. It is private land so it can be used for private purposes, within those legal constraints. To be afraid of foreign ownership of land is to be afraid of private ownership of land. And to punish it.Two things are going to happen if Morrison fails to approve the sale of Kidman. First, Kidman's owners are going to get less money for their property than otherwise. Less money is less investment in Australia - with its superior bid, we can assume that Dakang believes it can run a more efficient and profitable enterprise than any other bidder. Australia is still desperate for capital investment, particularly in the vast interior. Investment brings jobs. Investment brings growth. Blocking investment harms both.Second, any failure to approve seriously damages Australia's reputation for stable and reliable investment, and the marketability of other properties that might be sold in the future. Hence the concern from farming groups - WAFarmers and the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association, for instance. All this populist handwringing about foreign investment in agriculture actually harms the real farmers who want to maximise investment and sale prices.We have a clear national interest in attracting investment; a clear national interest in promoting investment certainty; a clear national interest in developing the interior; a clear national interest forging tighter economic links with China; and a clear national interest in allowing Australian property holders to get the best deal for their property.All of these things encourage economic development and growth, with flow-on effects that enhance our living standards. The Coalition understood this, when, after the 2013 election, they declared that Australia was open for business.

02 May 2016 12:08:14pmCorrect, Odie.   It seems that even ScoMo can see that a person on the minimum wage is not going to benefit by being able to afford more rump steaks if the Kidman sale to China goes through, and Chris Berg can't make a case for why anybody except the wealthy will benefit.   In the final breakdown, the LNP still need a majority of people to vote for them if they want to keep their taxpayer funded jobs.

02 May 2016 12:43:42pmKaren Middleton's article in the Saturday Paper.  " New rules for foreign investment".  States A report published on Monday a fortnight ago, by KPMG and Sydney University, titled Demistifying Chinese Investment in Australia, confirmed a sizeable boost in Chinese investment in 2015.  The Report says that in 2013 about 1% of Australian land was Chinese owned.  Last year there were 12 major deals of the best of our land and water, in dairy, beef and cotton.  Food security for the nation is an issue.  The biggest were Beingmate's investment in Darnum/Fonterra in Victoria, Tian a Bearing's Group's acquisition of Wollogorang and Wentworth stations in the Northern Territory, and Dashang's investment in Glenrock Station.  Other large stations among those in New South Wales, Queensland and the Northern Territory sold to Chinese interests include Hollymount Station, Elizabeth Downs and Undabri cotton farm.  In a recent interview with The New York Times, Ye Cheng dismissed security concerns as paranoid.  "You Americans think too much".  The senate inquiry Report into foreign investment in Australia says that a lack of transparency and clarity is undermining confidence, among both potential investors and the Australian public.  The report recommends that the new agriculture land register should be fully public.  The National Farmers Federation says "If it doesn't help inform the debate around what is being bought, by who and where, we'll be very disappointed".  A register of foreign- owned water entitlements is also due to be legislTed.  The Federation Farmers of Znew Zealand stTes"We need foreign investment, but not at any cost".  It has to be of some economic benefit and also a social benefit.

02 May 2016 12:46:27pmTo a telling degree - I think Morrison likes to pick and choose his neighbours.And can we be honest with this topic - it is not about foreign investment in Australian land (there is already lots of it owned by foreigners - mostly from the UK, USA and Europe), it is about Chinese investment.
Alert moderator
03 May 2016 10:14:16amConsidering it's standard practice for privately-owned Chinese property to be acquired by the government (including by leases after 50-100 years), it IS in the national interest, as it boils down to simply giving lucrative Australian land to another country's government in the long term, in exchange for a short-term profit boost for one single private company.Morrison was right on this policy.

02 May 2016 1:19:55pmPerhaps Mr Morrison understands Australia is not just an economy. We are a nation and a community. Which has an economy, the purpose of which is to benefit us as a nation and a community. Conservatism 101.

02 May 2016 6:58:50pmWishful thinking there, hairy.

02 May 2016 7:30:59pm"Perhaps Mr Morrison understands Australia is not just an economy. We are a nation and a community."He understands no such thing. He is just another Coalition xenophobe making excuses to justify his policy contradictions. My thoughts are that we should prohibit the purchase of land and real estate by overseas investors full stop. Let them invest in businesses, but not in the actual ownership of the land itself. There is no benefit to Australia or Australians of having flats in the city or farmland in the bush being owned by the Chinese government via one of its many proxies. We're less than 50-years since China's great Mao-designed famine and such a thing could very easily happen again. We need to retain the right to evict unwanted tenants from our physical territory.

02 May 2016 11:59:42amOne of the biggest lies in Australian politics is that buying out an Australian business constitutes investment in the relevant industry. It does not. Not one red cent goes into the industry; the money is simply paid to the former owners to make them go away. Should they happen to put some of that money into another venture in the same industry that is pure coincidence.In the case of Chinese investment we have the prospect of Chinese workers and equipment being imported to run the show and the end product shipped off to the Chinese owners. Everything except the land which we conveniently provide them, and no further advantage to the Australian economy ever. The protections against this mentioned by Berg simply never happen.Australia should be open for business, not for sale. Selling food to China into the future is good business, quitting now is not.

02 May 2016 12:25:23pmAn article by Karen Middleton "The new rules for foreign investors", in The Saturday Paper, two Saturday's ago was revealing.  The 99 year lease of the Darwin Port was to a company linked to China's People's Liberation Army, by reading the New York Times.  America was annoyed as its Naval Base is in Darwin.  FIRB, Federal Foreign Investment Review Board has had amendments made to it on critical infrastructure sales recently.  It also points out that the set of free trade agreements being signed with other countries are introducing inconsistencies to the rules and laws of Australia.  The FIRB's annual report, also published a few weeks ago, shows it approved $194.6 billion of foreign investment proposals, $46.6 billion of those involved Chinese investors.  China was the largest single source.  In dollar value the US was second.  The FIBR did not reject any proposals last financial year.  It placed conditions on 40%.  The largest slice of Foreign investments was in residential real estate in which approvals had tripled in the previous two years.

02 May 2016 4:13:47pmWhy was there no Australian buyer? I thought the superannuation funds were really flush. Is the yield so low? I haven't really got much against leases to the Chinese because you can set conditions in this case, even have a clause that conditions will be reviewed every two years. Why is there apparently no Australian interest or is the refusal a strategy to reduce the price? Anyway, if they have rules, they need to be  a bit more open about them. otherwise it triggers speculations that American interests are against that lease.
Alert moderator
02 May 2016 7:42:35pm"Anyway, if they have rules..."... I'd be more than surprised. The reason they don't publicise them is because they are non-existent. The decisions are arbitrary and to do with the politics of the moment. It might well be American objections to the new islands in the China Sea, it might well be anything else. Rules inhibit behaviour - the government wants to be able to use negotiations for more than just the obvious transactions.We should insist that the only immovable rule should be that land is not for sale. Invest in farming, invest in plant & labour, invest in technology and in distribution, invest in marketing and sales - but the land is not for sale. Australia is a country, not a business. It's production is for sale, it's means of production should not be.

02 May 2016 12:52:11pmAnd the same is true of most share trades. You will often hear people talk of investing in a business by buying shares, but the reality is that unless you buy in an IPO or other share offer you are paying a third party for those shares and none of the funds get anywhere near the actual company whose share are being bought and sold.It is true that popular shares go up in value and this is obviously useful to the company - but there is no investment in the business itself. It is just a wager that's all.

02 May 2016 5:24:12pmjonmarks, you have a very poor understanding of how shares work.  Once the shares have been purchased, shareholders reap profits by way of dividends or increase in the share price and suffer losses by way of decrease in share price.  As with all other purchases, buyer beware.  It ain't rocket science.
Alert moderator
02 May 2016 5:49:13pmWithout a secondary market there probably couldn't be a primary market Jon.  A lot of those sellers will be selling to take up new IPOs or other issues.  I can't imagine buying off a prospectus if there were no means of realising my investment, whether I was making money or losing it.  People's requirements change over their lives just as a company's profile changes.  Speculative becomes established goes broke.  It sounds as if you would ban share trading as a wager.  All businesses would then require debt funding or carry very inefficient balance sheets.  Companies would be born out of garages.  You are letting your ideology overcome your more rational side.

02 May 2016 2:32:14pmThe first paragraph might not be a meaningless post Los but I am having trouble locating the embedded meaning.  What money should a buyer of any business put into an industry?  How and where should they make this payment or gift?I presume the business is still largely owned by the family (may be wrong).  At some stage family businesses become unmanageable.  A sale and distribution of the proceeds allows family members to do their own thing, alone or in smaller groups.  Does it matter where they find the best value for further investment?  Economies grow and change.  Different industries wax and wane.  Let the capital move to where it can do the most good and provide the best return.I share your concern about Chinese workers being brought over in numbers on spurious reasons.  No concerns about the equipment brought in.  Anyone can import Chinese heavy machinery now surely?  Erosion of the tax base by Chinese businesses not looking to maximise profits is something to be guarded against.  No one should be a slave to a business or land.  The rights of ownership run in the other direction.
Alert moderator
02 May 2016 7:11:31pmNo point in looking for embedded meaning in my posts, OUB. A purchaser of any business does not put any money into an industry but this is not what is fed to us by some commentators. Of course they can if they want to. It's not complicated. No gifts involved.

02 May 2016 3:19:50pmHow right you are. There will be further problems with Chinese wanting to buy our farm land because of these Free Trade Deals that Abbott & Co bought.

02 May 2016 4:31:57pmIt's not our land Nova.  We have a system of private ownership of land in Australia.  I wonder whether you would turn away an overseas buyer for your home in favour of a local buyer offering you $100,000 less?
Alert moderator
02 May 2016 9:20:16pmIf we had a proper regime restricting foreign investment in our land and real estate you would never know that an overseas buyer was willing to pay more. The FIRB has approved numerous such purchases seemingly in contravention of government policy but this will stop.If I were selling a slab of Australia for $270 million I would not object to shaving off the odd $100,000. The principle should stand that Australian real estate remains for Australians.

02 May 2016 7:35:35pm"In the case of Chinese investment we have the prospect of Chinese workers and equipment being imported to run the show and the end product shipped off to the Chinese owners"Agree 100%. It is said that if you buy a man a fish you feed him for one day, buy him a fishing rod and you'll feed him for a lifetime. Selling our land to foreigners is like selling our fishing rods - one day we'll have to make do with buying fish from those who have the rods.We should sell the output of our production, not the means of our production.

03 May 2016 11:08:22amThink Apple is good at profit shifting China will vertically integrate crop to market in ways that leave Australia far worse off An vegetable operation will bring in most of the  equipment and staff On a large scale operation it will build its own airport for direct flights Staff will live in company dorms with no access to the outside world and be paid in China They will be sure to meet the tax rules so the workers are not "employed" in Australia With a free trade agreement there will be no need for customs apart from quarantine inspections  The Australian economy will only see returns on water licences government fees and any very limited outside services China is next day delivery for anything they need You can also expect that contract workers for labour hire will come in too And at rates that make local workers uncompetitive  For an example look at inbound tourism I know of an tour company who brings in 3 charters a week 900+ people on a set menu tour Shopping in company owned shops or contracted commission shops The company arranges a Tour company visa Which is simply rubber stamped No one overstays because they lose a security deposit($20000)

02 May 2016 12:01:09pmI fail to see how, if foreign interests where allowed to continue to buy up Australian farms, these foreign interests could not one day own a very large amount of food production in Australia and export it all to their homeland and we would have a shortage of food. It may not happen this year or next year, however one day we could wake up and discover that we have not enough to feed ourselves.
Alert moderator
02 May 2016 12:10:30pmLet's not confuse you failing to see how something might work with the thing actually not working.  Simple laws of economics / supply and demand mean there will always be demand for food in this country and there will always be people / companies / countries competing for the right to supply it.  There is nothing stopping Australian-owned farms from exporting all food to China.  That they don't suggests there is a very profitable food market in Australia.
Alert moderator
02 May 2016 12:36:57pm@Fail2Cunder normal circumstances I would agree with you but I think it's more complex than that.  You can't apply regular economic principles here because the risk is that there are motivations beyond the normally assumed economic profit maximisation.I think giving away 2% of Australia's food bowl to a country that is aggressively expanding into the territory of other nations, specifically to protect its ocean claims for fishing rights is dangerous.  It would not surprise me at all if eventually all food produced in this area went overseas, regardless of how much more profitable it would be just to provide it locally.I wonder if perhaps a government purchase and a leasing arrangement to a Chinese company would be more appropriate.
Alert moderator
02 May 2016 12:42:03pmI am aware of that and the point that Fish makes below, however at present when farms are Australian owned there can be some control, if the day comes when foreign countries wish to buy ALL produce from us, then it is a lot easier if they own the produce that their farms produce.  At present will sell a lot overseas and consume the rest, if we loose ownership of the farms we lose control. Besides if the farm ( Kidman Empire ), is not sold to the Chinese it will still produce beef, all that changes is that the heirs of Sidney, by choosing their ancestor very carefully,  do not get a windfall. What is in it for Australia? Any more jobs?

02 May 2016 12:54:22pmFail2C, you should look back at the history of sugar growing and harvesting in this country. Simple supply and demand doesn't apply.We used to grow, crush, process, use and sell our own sugar. Then we started selling the crushing plants. Then we sold the refining capacity. Then we sold the plantations.Now we buy products like canned pineapples grown in Australia on Thai-owned Australian plantations and processed in Thailand using sugar grown on Thai-owned plantations in Australia.Pineapples are a comparatively minor crop. But start selling off major portions of productive land like the Kidman property and we can easily foresee a situation where we will be eating Chinese-owned wheat grown in Australia on Chinese-owned farms and Chinese-owned beef raised on Chinese-owned land in Australia.And don't for a moment delude yourself that we will enjoy unrestricted access to these products. Again, the Thai sugar experience is sobering. In one poor production year the Thais simply stopped supplying Australia with sugar and sugar-containing products, claiming that other contracts took precedence. China has an enormous population, and in the event of a shortage it will continue to supply its home markets at the expense of Australian consumers, in the same way as the Thais.I was in China a little while ago, when the adulterated milk scandal was at its highest. Chinese mothers were queuing up at the airport begging to pay $12-15 for a litre of fresh Australian milk. The newspapers and people in the streets were clamouring for China to buy Australian milk producers. It could easily happen if we fall asleep at the wheel.
Alert moderator
02 May 2016 12:55:24pmYes, there is a profitable market. Now imagine how much more profitable it would be if, say, the Chinese took half our agricultural production and doubled, or tripled, the prices. Would that be a matter of 'simple economics?'Besides which, the Chinese Government has a habit of taking over profitable businesses, and I would rather prefer it if I wasn't beholden to them for my daily meal.

02 May 2016 1:08:23pmNot only are you exactly correct, but what the bleating hearts here never understand is that Australian butchers don't even buy the sort of cattle produced on the sort of wasteland being sold by Kidman.

Alert moderator
02 May 2016 12:13:51pmIt's a little more subtle than that, C Ash.   Beef prices are at an all time high and if Asia wants to buy our beef then they have to pay the going price for the commodity and the profit benefits Australia.    Once the producers are under Chinese control they will be able do the Singapore Sling like the big miners have been doing, except their version will be the "Beijing Boogie".   They will simply sell their Australian produce for a few percentage points above the cost of production to their Beijing parent company who will then pocket the difference between the cost of production and the market price.
Alert moderator
02 May 2016 5:49:17pmC AshThis is already happening. In the Lockyer Valley Chinese and Vietnamese companies have been buying land to grow their own food for export. Some of the land is in the best fertile areas. A property across the road from us was bought by the Vietnamese, specifically to grow Asian vegetables for export. All the work is done by FIFO workers, of which a number of them overstay their visas. Plenty of Immigration stings in the Lockyer Valley.Neither the State or Federal Governments care, so long as they get some kind of kickback for the coffers. How much land is sold off for foreign mining companies? The Kidman Run should be protected from full foreign ownership. The area alone is cause for concern for one company/Government body to own. It's enough that our ports are being leased out, time to protect our country for our children's future needs, ie food, water, shelter. Are we so stupid to have such an open door policy, when the same cannot be reciprocated?

03 May 2016 10:08:53amExactly right.  Why does this question not keep our politicians awake at night?  They are our representatives and should stand up for what is good for us, by not selling our country off, piece by piece.Furthermore, a lot of housing is being built over good farming land.  Why is there no mandatory environmental protection for food production?

02 May 2016 12:10:59pmThis whole thing highlights how bad the cattle industry is.To sell 1.3% of Australia for just $370 million gives an idea of the economics of the cattle industry.Indeed Clive Palmer's cattle property of 6,000 hectares was passed in without sale, and the highest bidder was only $1.5 million.Meanwhile the cattle industry consumes about 40% of Australia, and contributes to an enormous amount of environmental destruction, for virtually No Economic Gain.The cattle industry would be second only to the real estate industry for destruction of forests, and only a few of a very  few every make much money out of it.

02 May 2016 12:41:50pmGood points AndsoIn my state it is more like 70+% of land runs the holy cow and yet the industry still beefs about being locked out of small areas of national park.Sustainable production that takes into account native plants and animals, water quality of streams etc seems to have been thrown out the window and more and more marginal  looking country is being cleared.
Alert moderator
02 May 2016 1:02:54pmUnfortunately, in terms of the cattle industry taking up so much of Australia, there is little alternative. You see, that land can only be productive when being used to pasture animals (putting deforestation to one side for now). In terms of the animals one can ostensibly graze on that land, we have sheep, pigs, goats, and cows.Now with wool in low demand thanks to synthetic fabrics, and sheep bred for meat not an overtly profitable investment. With pork, we have issues of religious dietary laws, and a precedent for becoming feral, as well as many of the issues affecting beef. Goats... goats make deserts, if I can put it that way.That leaves the cow as the most viable option of grazing on a range this large, and creating a profitable product as a result.
Alert moderator
02 May 2016 1:57:47pmIt is a fairly "basic"means of production and potentially leaves a huge ecological imprint. However, if it is done in a sustainable manner it can attract a clean green premium price in developed markets.
Alert moderator
03 May 2016 9:48:37amI never said that it could not be done in a sustainable manner.First, we need to have a subset of the Dept. of Agriculture determining the best routes for running cattle, to minimize impact and maximize yield.Second, we need more stable and sustainable water sources, to avoid destroying the supply in aquifers.Third, we need to decrease the amount of methane coming from cows themselves, either through selective breeding or the introduction of new intestinal flora, as is currently being trialed.Fourth, we need to reclaim cow dung and extract its fertilizing elements (phosphates and nitrates), as well as capturing excess methane.Fifth, we can make the farms themselves more sustainable by replacing Diesel generators with solar power.Finally, we need to develop a better grazing species, that has a lower chance of 'jumping fence' but produces more biomass with the current resources.

02 May 2016 3:00:06pmThe so-called record beef prices are the same beef prices as they were 30 years ago when adjusted for inflation.And the beef prices are now going down, which means there is no long term future for the cattle industry in Australia.It reaches a point where any profits made are well short of the profits that could be made by investing the monetary assets elsewhere, and most of the cattle industry is at that point (i.e. a bad investment).We are also destroying so much of the wildlife in Australia to replace them with the dumbest species on the planet, which are beef cattle.Added to that, a cow produces as much greenhouse gas as a car.Probably the most intelligent thing the government could do is buy the land, take off the dumb and stupid cattle and close off the water holes (which would reduce the feral animals in the area).Give the land back to the native wild life, rather than give it to a foreign country that has negligible human rights.
Alert moderator
03 May 2016 9:57:07amThe drop in beef prices is temporary, as any watcher of commodity prices could tell you. Additionally, simply removing cattle production leaves a massive hole in our food supply, as well as our trade.Now as to your wildlife concerns, that can be dealt with surprisingly well with minimal environmental holdings within farmland, and greenhouse gas levels (not as much as a car, but still significant) can be decreased with selective breeding and intestinal flora modification.Finally, the area in question isn't actually of any particular ecological significance, and the idea that simply removing agricultural activities will lead to bush regeneration is fallacious, as is the idea that native wildlife can themselves survive without these waterholes.However, I will agree with you on one point. There is no circumstance under which we should be selling agricultural land to China, and that we are even considering it is setting a dangerous precedent.

02 May 2016 4:52:50pmThey are all pastoral leases.  The land is only good for cattle and apparently it is all exported to various parts of Asia.  Looking at their website it is a well run business and environmentally sound and cooperative.   I don't think it should be sold to anyone who is not Australian.   If the Kidman company wants out they should hand back the leases.

03 May 2016 12:45:34pmWell put. Kilo for Kilo, running Olive-Brown pythons or many other native species would be far better value. Somehow Australia has to kick the old-colonial habit and return to an economy based on greater biodiversity.

02 May 2016 12:22:55pmWhy all the fuss?  We are talking about a sum of only $370 million.  Compared to other foreign investment, this is insignificant.  People only pay above the market if they think they can do better.  Given that the Chinese do not have expertise in the cattle industry, one can only assume other factors, such as lower wages for Chinese workers or providing a food source for the Chinese people, are behind the price offered.
Alert moderator
02 May 2016 2:13:23pmActually the price offered has more to do with the fact Chinese investors like investing in places outside of China because of the higher sovereign risk in China and greater capital controls in that country.People are also willing to pay above market price for assets of substantially lower risk and diversification which is what is driving the majority of Chinese investment around the world.

02 May 2016 12:29:55pmThe blood vessels in the CIA and Pentagon's foreheads would be popping if the sale had gone to the Chinese. How could they continue the Cold War policy of 'containment' if the Australian Government s letting the Communists infiltrate amongst US spy bases in Australia.I don't know what the authors worried about though. Morrison has until after the election to make his final decision (90 days).The early pre-pre-finalization statement was to placate voters, many of whom see that sale of land to Communists as conflicting with their 'US/Western' childhood indoctrination of the necessity to keep the 'evil yellow/red hordes' from getting 'under the bed'.As for heavily regulated 457's 'skilled visa's. All jobs on offer should be to Australian's. 457's are a scam to allow corporation/business to access cheap labour and further withdraw from the vocational training they used to provide 50years ago, saving themselves on costs (then have the gall to blame Universities and school's for not providing 'job ready applicants' to their exact specifications!).

02 May 2016 12:32:42pmChris, there are millions of mouths to feed within China and the rest of the world. Our produce is world class, these are just 2 reasons why other countries are buying our farmlands. Selling our farmlands will benefit the owners, not all Australians. But if the farms are kept in Australian hands then, WE can sell our produce to those that require them. Australians make the money. Now that to me is in OUR interest.

02 May 2016 12:43:18pmObviously it is in our national interest to refuse the sale of 1% of our land to the Chinese. Given that they already own substantial assets including the port facilities in Darwin, the biggest dairy farm in Tasmania and half of the houses everywhere, maybe it will mean that we will be able to avoid an eviction notice being served on our grandchildren once they have bought more than 50% of the joint.

02 May 2016 12:52:28pmBefore one considers what the national interest in preventing the foreign ownership of what are, quite frankly, obscene land holdings, one must consider how allowing the deal would play into the public interest.Would it create jobs? No.Would it inject cash into the coffers? Not much.Would it energize local communities? What communities?The fact is that selling this property to a foreign investor only increases the value of the sale to the one selling it. For the rest of us, it:Places a large amount of land in the ownership of a company in a country where the government and military routinely confiscate corporate concerns.Places wilderness in the care of a country that has shown itself unwilling to accede to environmental programs.Creates a precedent for the large-scale sale of agricultural land and its related services to foreign investors, making it more difficult to argue against, say, the sale of cubby station.Given these issues, especially the final issue, I would argue that denying this sale IS within the public interest, both legally, from a resource standpoint, and in terms of national security.That of course, is all assuming that the land isn't wanted for some other reason (mineral resources below ground, for example).

02 May 2016 12:54:59pmI find it a bit of a contradiction that on the one hand the current government denies foreign ownership or land in a private sale such as this, while on the other hand it is encouraging "asset transfers" (i.e. privatisations) of state government owned entities, knowing full well that overseas interests are the main buyers of these assets.So it's OK to sell publicly owned assets to foreign buyers - indeed the Federal government even encourages it - but not OK to sell privately owned assets to foreign buyers?

02 May 2016 12:54:59pmFor a long time it has been recognised that foreign investment is the life blood of the Australian Economy.  However, we seem to be seeing a major shift in what our economy is doing and I am beginning to wonder whether encouraging foreign investment simply because foreign consortiums can cobble together more funds for purchase than local buyers is in the best interest of our economy and people.If we are to compete with Asian countries in particular we as a people will need to lower our life style expectations and I am not so sure this is what Australians want.  We need to ask ourselves whether we want to go the American way where whole swathes of people are disadvantaged while the rest live lifestyles of comparative wealth and privilege.  If we are willing to sacrifice our more egalitarian way of life for a dog eat dog one, then we need to embrace worshipping at the alter of the mighty dollar above all else.  This entails encouraging foreign investment into our business and housing markets and forcing millions of Australians to fight over the scraps.  At the same time,  wealthier Australians' funds are fleeing overseas to low tax havens.Australia is hurtling towards an imperative to decide which crossroad we are going to travel.  One thing is sure and that is that change is here and it is time for the hard decisions to be made by government and the electorate, now.

02 May 2016 1:15:12pmWhen rule by the Party is the norm rather than rule of law, all Chinese entities are inevitably under the influence or control of the Chinese state.  Until there is genuine political reform in China that country must always be treated as a special case.  Restrictions on Chinese purchases of Australian assets are reasonable and desirable.

02 May 2016 1:18:49pmSo, the national interest is an 'empty qualifier' for Chris Berg! Guess it would be when your politics are the politics of big business, greed, and private financial self-interest.  'Foreign investment' should not mean foreign ownership of Australian land.  Let's ask, and ask again - who benefits? If you don't understand, or don't believe in the common good, the national interest, then I believe it's not too late to take the bus to the airport, Chris.Potential foreign investors, Chris, will see the Australian decision as a wise and sensible one, and see Australia as a smart country, because how many other sovereign nationals just sell off the actual nation, and land, country, soil, particularly to other sovereign nations?  How easy would it be to buy 10% of Chinese land mass?There are more intelligent ways to capitalise on the land, with long-term leases which return just as much over time, but reduce the risk of the land being  run down, environment ruined, and future generations having to buy it back...in the national interest.

02 May 2016 1:24:55pmThis is not foreign investment in Australian enterprise, it is selling Australian land to overseas buyers.  There is no benefit in this for Australians.

Libertarianism is not necessarily liberating for the broader community.

China is just a source of cash and cheap labour, nothing but trading and economic growth  as far as the eye can see.Then theres the actual world no one want to discus, becasue they buy our minerals.Ask Malcolm Turnbul  how in China the waiting period for a new heart is 12 weeks.  (think about that for a minute!)  or how China is actually spending twice the 190 billion they say they are on Military spending.  Or how China recently hacked our BOM as it ports into many strategic IT systems.  How about all the building goods that are supplied with certificates that are just photocopies, so when apartments catch fire the whole facade goes up in flames and spreads.How their industries could poison their own children to get a few more cents per litre of milk and kill a few hundred babies. ( Theres that love of the dollar again Chris!)How about the current leaders mother being worth 2 billion us even though he say's he's cracking down on corruption.How about how China claims almost all of the south china sea even though Internal law say's otherwise.  Although we are no better with bugging east timor and claiming more than our fair shair of gas and oil rights.Well the answer is that china is a THREAT.  you can argue how big and how bad but its in plain sight.   Huawei was banned from installing Cabling in ACT ... and certain buildings because they are a PLA linked state owned company that has currently about 40,000 employees involved in corporate espinonage.So I think I just told you why handing over our land to the chinese is a bad idea.

02 May 2016 2:09:32pmLots of people seem to like wringing their hands with slogans like 'food security' and 'risk to australian jobs'But the fact is if this was sold to China it doesn't stop it being part of Australia and subject to Australian Law.Lets face it, the whole concept of 'land ownership' is a myth. No-one actually owns land. They just own a piece of paper by the government that by agreement administers it under the conditions the government can set and alter.If the Chinese owners decided to ship it all off to China, so what? If we were having food shortages you really think the government wouldn't intervene with a ban on exports? Lets face it, the Chinese owners are out to make money from it and that money could buy a lot more of something else from other low cost producers than what its direct product value might be if shipped off to China.You think they will import workers? Well so what? They need to have visa's, be paid in Australian dollars according to Australian workplace rights and conditions.You think there will be food safety scandals like China has? They still need to produce to Australian quality and are subject to Australian law and penalties if they don't.The knee jerk reaction to foreign ownership is largely another displacement concern based in xenophobia and bad assumptions instead of where the attention and concern really should be, on our domestic immigration, health and safety, food standards and industrial relations laws and policies.

02 May 2016 2:10:49pmI agree with some of that.  No doubt populism is a driver.  The issue had real potential to damage the Government if they ignored this aspect just the same.  The national interest is a handy catch-all rather than a well-defined term, a useful phrase to throw around when a government really doesn't want to do.  It disguises unworthy intent with a profession of worthiness.  When a takeover is knocked back on national interest grounds the sellers do bear the financial burden of the missed opportunity, which is unfair.For all that I am not unhappy with the decision.  The land may be semi-arid but the layout was strategic in allowing Kidman's herd to always have access to feed.  My concern with Chinese companies is that typically they will be funded by their government.  I am very dubious that they would be good taxpayers, being more concerned with cheap beef for China than making a profit in Australia.  The initial large purchase could be further supplemented by numerous smaller purchases.  How much of Australia would be too much for you Chris?  Any limits at all?  Having said that there was some publicity about a Chinese concern buying up big in NZ dairy farms.  Initial concerns seem to have faded, they have been seen as good custodians of the land.  Whether they have eroded the tax base in NZ I do not know.  Dairy prices have collapsed in recent times, whether that is a factor I have no idea.There has been some publicity about DomaCom looking to crowd fund the purchase of S Kidman & Co.  Reports in the AFR had some arrangement with a stockbroker, Shaw and Company, to raise further funds to complete the purchase.  This arrangement seems to have been frustrated by the announcement of the Chinese deal.  May well be revived now.  There is a lot of romance around the Kidman story.  I would be surprised if there wasn't further interest from other parties, particularly with many investors looking for greater exposure to agriculture.  There may yet be some competitive tension in the bidding for this business.

02 May 2016 2:14:10pm"Rejecting a Chinese bid for land is in 'the national interest'? Show me how."Well, that's easy.  The coalition has a voter base which has been conditioned and nurtured to be racist and xenophobic.  So they see foreign investment (and foreigners, and tourists, etc) as scary.  The coalition says no to the Chinese investment, making the coalition heroes to the white Australia loving voter base.And so you see 'national interest' actually refers to coalition interest.  I hope that helps clear this up.

02 May 2016 2:19:21pmIt is so thick, you can cut it with a knife. No, not the smoke haze from bush fires. I am talking about the shadow of an election.Scot Morrison is left with little choice but to reject the deal. On what ground? "National Interest" of course. Imagine what he will cop if he approves it. Voters from all sides will protest loudly. I doubt he and Turnbull dare to draw a cross across themselves and set themselves up as a target. Too close to an election for a major decision to be made. I am often amused by the "national interest" mantra. "Buy Oztrayan" were splash across the TV screen way too often. "Look for items with a 'Made in Oztraya'", we are told. I did I bought some T-shirts made in Oztraya. Within a few washes, the thread began to come off, and the seams fell apart. No much good for my confidence in following the "Buy Oztrayan" spruik. The there was Dick Smith flogging his own "Dick" brand. Peanut butter taste just like any other except it actually costs more than the generic ones. It is no worse, but definitely np\o better than others. Shoppers ultimately made their purchasing decision based on their the size of their own wallet. With decisions that doesn't cost them anything immediate, like the Kidman deal, they want their principles maintained, ie. not to allow it to fall into foreign hands, especially the Chinese. Shopping for peanut butter? That is a different matter altogether.Therefore Scot Morrison rejected the deal because he doesn't want to make it a target in the coming election. I bet a different outcome will emerge AFTER the election though.

02 May 2016 2:49:23pmYet again we see people who know what "investment" is, use it in a  distorted way.One company buying up another is not investment in the sense that it gets portrayed to be..i.e. building up the overall stock of assets in a country to create wealth now and into the future.This is just a transfer of ownership of assets which already exist here and if the author cannot see the difference between foreign buyers who are individuals acting in their own self interests as opposed to companies that will act in a way dictated to them by their national centralised government, then he should be looking for another job.Now is not the problem but when food security and shortages start to hit (and anyone who thinks it never will, go back to sleep and stop annoying the rest of us), companies in the food supply chain owned wholly or in part by the Chinese govt will receive their instructions to ship production back into China regardless of local demand. Australia has relied on UK and then USA foreign investment for its development and all that investment has been based on the capitalistic profit motive. If you want to see what happens when private companies go abroad and buy up overseas resources on the pretence of capitalism but in truth was a government backed plan of domination, then go study the East India Co or the Dutch East Indies Co.

02 May 2016 3:40:22pmThere are 5000 Australian investors who have already put up their hand for S.

(This assumes that the S. Kidman would eventually be listed on the ASX)So if locals are given the green light, then possibly, we might all get a piece of the pie.The outright ownership of 2% of this country by foreign buyers is unwise, in the same way that any private ownership of so much land is unwise: the uniformity of land use, especially for cattle, may not be a long term proposition (economically speaking) because of water shortages which might only get worse, and to diversify and possibly pipe water in for agriculture, should be a decision for Australians and by Australians.A business such as is proposed for Chinese investors is not in our interest.

02 May 2016 3:49:33pmWe want to determine who comes into the country. The billions we are spending on keeping people out is an indicator.We should know who owns every inch of this country.

02 May 2016 4:09:49pmI could be wrong, but my understanding is that it is a lease for sale, not the land itself.I also believe that Kidman already export the vast majority of their product overseas right now.As I said, I could be wrong!

03 May 2016 12:34:50pmYou're right, SteveM, it's a Crown Lease. That means the land is owned by the Crown (government) and can be leased for periods of up to 99 years. The leases are transferable, i.e. can be sold, so what we're talking about here with Kidman is the sale of the lease, not the sale of the land.I wish the media would get their facts right, so that we didn't have to research everything ourselves before posting a comment!All the same, ownership should remain with Australia.

02 May 2016 4:21:00pmI'm surprised no-one's mentioned the LNP's real reason for denying this ridiculous deal that oh so sadly deprives its sell-out owners of a few million of their billions in wealth: the hacking of the BOM sites. It's a straight tit-for-tat, admittedly populist, but one of the very few levers we have left to communicate displeasure to an ever-aggresive China. As for Berg's claim that 'any company can bring in 457 visa holders': of course they can, but you can guarantee a Chinese one would exploit that fouly abused policy to the hilt. That program merely lets neanderthal businesses off the hook for training Australians, and should be shut down all together.

02 May 2016 5:02:34pmThere is no simple answer to this.   But rather a quick flash of what now constitutes an intrinsic part of the Australia psyche:  the idea of sovereignty or rather the lack of it.Although this article does not even contain the word, it sure amounts to a very important cultural and national attribute.  Moreso to China and almost every other country in the World.  But so long as everyone can claim their properties went up XX%, are paying the minimum payment on the maxxed-out credit card, did I mention I bought the new Audi last week?- All is lovely in the World.And as far as the rule of Law goes, such things can be easily bypassed by foreigners.  Bold statement, you may say.  Special dispensation or whatever sugar-coating phrase that is used by local, state & federal Governments is often used to make sure things happen for foreign investors.The Government has a duty to know and enforce what is in the National Interest, not you or I.  It is a reflection of us and our Nation to be able to say yes or no; rather than be told otherwise.The Chinese are not here to create jobs or sell the goods they make here to us.  There is only one reason and it is money.  Agriculture in China is questionable at best with illegal chemicals, practices and inhumane treatment of everything - including those with only 2 legs.  They have ruined much of their own land/waterways and such behaviour would definitely be transposed here over time, once they have had the "Honeymoon period"(read: special dispensation). Such a business culture is an infraction on us and our way of undertaking agriculture.  This business culture will also obliterate our fine and upstanding reputation as a clean and unpolluted food hub of which we should be very proud of and seek to retain, for it is something we can also ask a premium for in overseas markets & the Chinese know this.  For those of you who do not know, our low population/density is also a major contributor to this factor.As a sideline, I also wonder what the Aboriginal people, the original custodians of the land would think of this?

02 May 2016 8:40:22pmAustralian employees are paid one of the highest wage rates in the world. There are definite upsides to this eg a more motivated work force. But there is a huge downside. The cost of making anything in Australia is very high. Almost everything Australians buy today is made in China. The Chinese do not yet pay themselves such high wages, so we are benefitting from their cheaper labour. It means that most goods we buy such as TVs and laptops and smart phones, are relatively cheap compared to what the average Aussie earns. Without the stuff from China, we would not be able to afford most the things we buy today. At the same time most of the foreign currency we earn comes from the sale of iron-ore and coal to China. Without that income we would have little foreign reserves and our dollar would go through the floor and we would become the banana republic Keating mentioned on more than one occasion. Nobody would be able to afford to go travelling without the money we earn from China. The reality is we need China more than they need us. By siding so openly with the US in the fight between the two giants for hegemonic power, we also risk our relationship with China.  China is not going to be stopped by the US. China has almost 5x the population of the US. Already US educators are worried that Chinese children are sharper and more tech savvy that their counterparts in the US. Chinese military spending will soon outstrip that of the US. Australia can act as a mediator in the mad escalation of the China-US confrontation. But Australia must be less xenophobic about China. Australia should form real relations with the Chinese where mutual benefits and realpolitik are the objectives, rather than hoping we will continue to be a rich country riding on the back of China. Morrison's decision is short-sighted but could also be xenophobic.

02 May 2016 11:35:37pmWhen I'm allowed to buy a holiday or residential property in China, as a foreigner, I'll view chinese ownership of Australian land in an entirely new light.Until then, let them eat home units.

03 May 2016 1:59:33amOn this occasion I agree with Morrison. The argument that foreign investment is good for Australia is one the LNP has been making for a long time but here is the falicy and is seems the LNP is lying once again.We don't need investment of any kind to stimulate the economy. All we have to do is stimulate demand and this will generate the supply and therefore the investment. The problem is that demand is disappering in Australia because the market, under the LNP, is drying up. The vast majority of working families can't afford to buy well made Australian goods anymore. Goodbye Holden, Toyota, Electrolux, Ford, Hills, Speedo and all the supporting industries. It was no accident Toyota chose to pull out just after the last election. Nobody can afford to buy a well made Australian car anymore even if, in the long run, in ends up costing less than a junk import.My mother bought a good quality electric jug made in Australia 30 years ago. It is still going. One we bought 6 months ago made in China needs replacing already. The free trade agreement made with China is a joke.The top few percent are now paying half the tax burden whereas ten years ago it was only one third. That shows nothing more than than the rich are the only ones making money anymore and they don't spend their money in Australia, thanks to LNP policies, they accumulate it and so our economy crumbles because demand crumbles.Why not sell it all to China? I'm going to emigrate to a third world country soon and leave Australia to all you fools who vote for the LNP to completely wreck the economy because I will end up a lot happier and better off than you.

03 May 2016 7:24:10amHow can consumers stimulate Australian manufacturers to produce anything, if they expect to buy electric kettles that work for over thirty years? Or V-8 cars that last for twenty years?Consumer items need to be mass produced, be cheap in price and wear out relatively quickly in order to have a strong economy and manufacturing base.Mass production + Mass consumption = 20th Century prosperity 101.

03 May 2016 9:14:44amWell at the end of the day it is really a question of trust. Do the foreign investors trust the Australian Government to protect their investment in circumstances that may prevail from time to time which is not in our national interest.

03 May 2016 9:36:32am"Geographic size isn't everything." No it isn't. What Kidman's were trying to sell is its "legendary" system of getting cattle from point of increase (to use an Aboriginal/Anthropological concept) to point of sale, putting on weight all the way). Whose land it was on was never really relevant to Sidney Kidman. That system today extends into Asian and other markets.The real issue for the coalition, that cattle have largely underwritten the National Party in the past. A Chinese buyer might support the party, but its interest would always look suspect compared to the men in hats.As for reinvestment in Australia, that is unlikely. Kidman's shareholders would be laughing all the way to the bank, at least 50% of them in London and other offshore places.This wouldn't be the first time Kidman's have had a run fowl of governments because of their tall poppy image.What really needs to happen is that pastoral leases need to be treated more like the grazing rights they are supposed to be, and that the land underneath is under constant review for its environmental, biodiversity and other values that could produce a post-colonial economy. Macumba alone is 11,000 sq km run by 10 people, keeping just 8000 head of cattle about 2 years out of 10. It displaces a Lower Southern Aranda/Wangkangurru population under a coercive migration of 50 years. Their population is increasing, perhaps back to levels of 1870. There is a strong desire to build a post-colonial economy among these Australians. Ironically, they are also of part-Chinese descent.Coalition or Labor, its time to dump the old colonial "vision splendid" and overhaul land management for both investment and social justice. Neither the Chinese or the UN Declaration for the Rights of Indigenous People are going to go away anytime soon.

03 May 2016 11:46:54amAbbott said that Australia was open for business. Either Abbott was lying (very likely) or he meant to say that Australia was now open for sale (quite likely, given the former PM's mashing of vocabulary and selling off anything of value that wasn't nailed down). Either way, Abbott was wrong, economically and every other way.That aside, Berg's so-called argument about the Kidman sale is a total furphy. It's based on the premise that foreign ownership of our land can somehow be beneficial, just because we're too cheap or lazy to do something with it ourselves.Let's be quite clear on this - there should be no foreign ownership of Australian real property - residential or otherwise. Foreigners can still invest in projects in real estate, but the title to the property should be held in the name of an Australian citizen or company incorporated in Australia and in that case, an Australian citizen or company must hold at least 50% of the shares.Perhaps Mr Berg would like to comment on the leasing of Australian ports to Chinese interests? Does he not believe that US military interests in Australia, like Pine Gap etc, do not make us a military target?Now, could Mr Berg please respond to the proposition that Australian businesses are ready and able to trade with the rest of the world?

03 May 2016 12:57:20pmI have worked in environmental sciences for many years all over Australia.I seen many cases of foreign owners buying large pastoral leases and ruining the land. e.g. massively overgrazing, not controlling invasive species. They then sell the produce to their own company overseas. Once the land is trashed (only takes 5 years or so), sell it and let someone else clean it up.
