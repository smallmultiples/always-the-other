Two Chinese men have been charged after Australian Federal Police (AFP) seized enough illegal drugs to make up to 1.7 million ecstasy tablets. The Australian Border Force (ABF) last month found more than 500 kilograms of crystal MDMA — used to make ecstasy — hidden inside aluminium rolls that were shipped into Sydney's Port Botany from Italy.They called the AFP who tracked the consignment to its final destination, a storage facility in Miranda in Sydney's south, where they arrested two Chinese nationals on Sunday."This is the equivalent of 1.7 million tablets of MDMA and has an estimated street value of $60 million," AFP Acting Commander Brett James said."If the accused men are found guilty, they face the prospect of life in prison."In October, the AFP seized more than a tonne of crystal MDMA in an investigation that led to the arrest of two Polish men.That was the fourth largest seizure of MDMA in Australia's history.This latest example is the fifth largest seizure, and the ABF said the criminals involved worked hard to conceal the drugs."The container was loaded at the Port of Genoa in Italy, and the goods that were declared were aluminium rolls — 20 pallets of aluminium rolls," ABF regional commander Tim Fitzgerald."ABF officers used specialist equipment that revealed an inner cylinder within the rolls. The inner cylinder was lined with lead."One of the inner cylinders was found to contain 13.5 kilograms of MDMA."Mr Fitzgerald said 40 of the 200 aluminium rolls had MDMA hidden inside them.He said although the containers would have gone through other international ports, it was no surprise the drugs were not detected earlier."That container would have been a tran-shipment container on that particular vessel of no interest [to local authorities] unless it was being landed in that particular country," he said.AFP acting commander Brett James urged people not to take ecstasy, a message he said was particularly important ahead of summer and the schoolie season."Be very careful and think about what you put into your bodies," he said."You don't know what is in those tablets and it can have disastrous consequences."He said further arrests may be made over this investigation.
