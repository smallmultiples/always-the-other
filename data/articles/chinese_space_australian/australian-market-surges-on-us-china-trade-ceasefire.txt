Australian markets have rebounded after China and the United States agreed to a trade ceasefire at the G20 summit over the weekend.US President Donald Trump agreed to hold off for three months — until March 1 — before he increases tariffs on $US250 billion worth of Chinese imports.In the meantime, negotiators from Beijing and Washington will attempt to negotiate a deal to de-escalate their trade war, which has plagued global markets for the past year.The ASX 200 closed 1.8 per cent higher at 5,771, essentially clawing back its losses from the past three weeks.Almost nine out of 10 stocks in the benchmark index traded higher.Meanwhile, the broader All Ordinaries index added 1.9 per cent to 5,856.The Australian dollar had also rebounded 0.6 per cent to 73.63 US cents on optimism that the world's two largest economies can resolve their trade differences.Some analysts believe the market's relief rally might be short-lived and overly optimistic, as the US and China are far apart in regards to their trade expectations."The result is better than the market expected, but the huge divide remaining continues to suggest a bumpy ride ahead," Citi economist Li-Gang Liu said."Comparing the official statements, we find that the US stresses more on China's structural reform issues on forced technology transfer, IP [intellectual property] protection, non-tariff barriers, cyber intrusions and cyber theft, services and agriculture.""China continues to highlight its willingness to increase imports from the US to reduce the trade imbalance, as well as open its markets wider for foreign participation."Another complication may be the conflicting advice that Mr Trump receives from his advisers."We do not know for certain what can satisfy US trade negotiators on progress," Societe Generale managing director Stephen Gallagher said."The US administration has both hardline and softline views, [and] each side at different times appears to have an upper hand influencing President Trump."Every sector traded higher, with resources (+3.7pc), energy (+4.6pc) and health care (+2.6pc) being the best-performing sectors.The energy sector was driven higher by a rebound in oil prices, with Brent crude rising 5.1 per cent to $US62.48 per barrel.This comes after oil prices plummeted by around 30 per cent last month.There is mounting speculation that the world's largest oil-producing nations — including Saudi Arabia and Russia — will agree to substantial production cuts to prevent prices from bleeding further.GrainCorp's share price jumped 26.7 per cent to $9.25, making it today's best-performing stock.This was after it received a $2.4 billion takeover offer (at $10.42 per share), well above its current market value.Bluescope Steel was one of the strongest performers, up 11.8 per cent to $12.55 — after it announced a $250 million on-market share buyback.Some of the other high-profile stocks with significant gains were Santos (+8.7pc), Fortescue Metals (+4.3pc), Origin Energy (+6pc), BHP (+3.7pc) and Woodside Petroleum (+3.5pc).On the flipside, the worst-performing stocks in the benchmark index were Metcash (-5.4pc), St Barbara (-8pc) and Afterpay (-2.2pc).
