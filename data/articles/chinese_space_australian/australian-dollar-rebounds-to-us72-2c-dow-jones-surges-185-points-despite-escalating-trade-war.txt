The latest shots fired in the US-China trade war were not as bad as investors feared, which sparked a rebound in the Australian dollar, and a rally in overseas markets.US President Donald Trump imposed a 10 per cent tariff on $US200 billion worth of Chinese imports yesterday, which was lower than the 25 per cent he had flagged weeks ago.Beijing's retaliation against Washington was also softer than expected, when it announced 5-10 per cent tariffs targeting $US60 billion worth of American goods.This prompted Mr Trump to threaten, in a tweet, that he would escalate the trade dispute if China targets US agricultural or industrial workers, his key support base. China has limited retaliatory levers it can pull on the tariff front, said Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise Financial Services in Michigan.Any escalation is likely to involve its currency or making it harder for US companies to operate in China, but the immediate dent to the economic picture is likely to be small, he added."We anticipate this last round of tariffs, the $US200 billion, it's only probably going to add 0.2 percentage points to consumer prices. That's nothing," Mr Saglimbene said."The market is smart and it's sniffing out through the end of the year the tariff impact is likely to be small on economic growth and it's small on corporate profits."The Australian dollar lifted moderately (+0.5pc) to a three-week high of 72.2 US cents, and was the best performing G10 currency in the past 24 hours.It also bounced back to 54.9 British pence, 61.8 euro cents and 81 Japanese yen, levels which it fell below weeks ago. "While the Australian dollar is playing to the risk-on mood in markets, it's a little surprising that markets have taken the news in their stride," said NAB economics director David de Garis.Mr de Garis noted that many traders have been betting on the local currency to fall further, before its unexpected bounce overnight."For the Australian dollar, we would also note that while not at record shorts, positioning in the Australian dollar has been very short and the absence of more bad new news has likely contributed to its mini bounce."Commonwealth Bank's currency strategists believes the dollar surge may also be due to comments made by the Reserve Bank in its latest meeting minutes, released on Tuesday.The minutes said that "the next move in the cash rate would more likely be an increase than a decrease"."The RBA minutes from its September meeting were a positive surprise for some market participants," said CBA's senior currency strategist Joseph Capurso."But with the US-China trade dispute likely to exacerbate, we see more downside to the Australian dollar, potentially testing 70 US cents before year-end."The Australian share market is expected to begin the day higher, with ASX futures gaining 28 points, or 0.5 per cent. It is likely to follow a strong overnight lead from foreign markets.Asian markets experienced a massive relief rally, with China's Shanghai Composite jumping 1.8 per cent to 2,700.In Europe, London's FTSE was flat at 7,300, while Germany's DAX lifted 0.5 per cent to 12,158.Wall Street's technology stocks drove the Nasdaq to rebound by 0.8 per cent to 7,956.The benchmark S&P 500 index rose 0.5 per cent, and the blue-chip Dow Jones index added 185 points, or 0.7 per cent, to 26,247.Tech stocks were bolstered by news that Apple and fitness gadget-maker Fitbit would escape the tariffs.Apple shares closed up 0.2 per cent while Fitbit shares rose 6.4 per cent.Among losers, Tesla sank 3.4 per cent after disclosing that it had received a request for documents from the US Department of Justice regarding chief executive Elon Musk's public statements about taking the company private.
