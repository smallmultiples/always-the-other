US President Donald Trump has imposed a 10 per cent tariff on $US200 billion worth of additional China imports. The US Trade Representative's office has released a long list of Chinese goods which will be affected.The list is 200 pages, and targets goods ranging from industrially significant Chinese technology to "farm wagons and carts, not mechanically propelled".The tariffs will not go into effect immediately but will first undergo a two-month review process.China is expected to retaliate against the US with further tariffs shortly.Last week, Mr Trump said the United States may ultimately impose tariffs on more than $US500 billion worth of Chinese imports — roughly the total amount that China imported to America last year.The Australian dollar fell 0.5 per cent to 74.2 US cents (at 8:50am AEST), following reports the Trump administration would indeed proceed with this move.It also slipped against the British pound (-0.3pc), Euro (-0.4pc), Japanese yen (-0.7pc) and New Zealand dollar (-0.1pc).In local economic news, the housing finance figures (May) are out today, along with Westpac's consumer confidence report.The Australian share market is expected to rise in early trade, with ASX futures up 16 points.Earnings season kicked off with PepsiCo's strong quarterly results, while a surge in oil prices helped to boost Wall Street.The Dow Jones index rose 143 points, or 0.6 per cent to 24,920. The S&P 500 gained 0.3 per cent to reach a five-month high, while the Nasdaq closed at breakeven point.Reports about the further tariffs on China were published after US markets closed.The consumer staples sector lifted 1.3 per cent and was the biggest boost to the S&P 500.It was driven by PepsiCo shares which surged 4.8 per cent, its biggest single-day jump in around seven years — after the company's results topped estimates on strong sales of snacks.The company also reaffirmed its full-year forecast amid signs of a gradual recovery in its soda business.Procter & Gamble stocks rose 2.5 per cent, while Coca-Cola was up 1.3 per cent.The benchmark S&P index has lifted 4.5 per cent since the end of 2017, rising about 3 per cent in the last four trading days, helped by upbeat news on the economy and earnings.Worries over rising bond yields and potentially firming inflation drove the early February selloff, which confirmed a correction for the market.Overall, the profits of S&P companies are expected to grow by about 21 per cent this quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data.It was also a solid night in European markets as investors focused more on corporate earnings season, rather than the United States starting trade wars with China and other nations.Paris rose 0.7 per cent, Frankfurt climbed 0.5 per cent, while London was flat.
