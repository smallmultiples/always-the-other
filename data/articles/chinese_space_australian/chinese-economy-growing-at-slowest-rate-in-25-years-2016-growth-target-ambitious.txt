China's economy is growing at its slowest pace in 25 years, with even the 6.5 to 7.5 per cent growth target for 2016 set over the weekend considered ambitious.London City stockbroker David Buik, who works at Panmure Gordon, said he did not believe growth was anywhere near 6.5 per cent."Truth be told, I think it's probably near 4 per cent," Mr Buik said.But not everyone is as sceptical. JP Morgan's chief economist, Sally Auld, is among those who believe China's economy is still quite robust."I'm sure if you were focusing more on the industrial economy you would be looking at growth rates of close to 3 to 4 per cent, but that's not the whole story in China," Ms Auld said.In fact, Ms Auld is still quite sanguine about Australia's largest trading partner."We're bullish on the export story, for sure," she said."We're certainly not rushing to mark down Australian growth forecasts just because Chinese growth is probably going to slip from something closer to 7 last year to 6.5 this year."The economic target was announced by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang at the National People's Congress.The annual meeting in Beijing sets out to determine both the economic and political agenda for the country. Minister in charge of National Development and Reform Commission, Xu Shaoshi, was put forward to sell the growth agenda.He said the new target enlarged the "acceptable elastic range of economic growth" and suited the potential of China's economic growth as well."Many experts have measured and calculated our country's potential economic growth rate, which matches with this range. So, it is helpful for achieving the overall target," he said.But Panmure Gordon's David Buik said that was all just political speak."There is a party line that everybody has to adapt to, and I think they would be smiling to themselves at this rhetoric, which is basically party politics," Mr Buik said.It is also party politics to continue making jobs.Mr Buik said a key concern for the Communist Party was maintaining social order — something that could be in doubt if the enormous number of new graduates coming through were not able to find work."They have eight to nine million students who are looking for gainful employment coming out of university — highly educated people," Mr Buik said."The Chinese authorities need to know that there is going to be gainful employment for these people, because any thought of any possible repetition of Tiananmen Square would be completely unacceptable."And so the war cries from the Communist Party have already begun."To realise this target requires our hard work. We should make concerted efforts nationwide to ensure our economic growth will be carried out in this rational range and under the leadership of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council," Minister Xu Shaoshi said.It could well be a tough sell — earlier this week, a government official said 1.8 million workers were expected to be laid off in the steel and coal industries.
