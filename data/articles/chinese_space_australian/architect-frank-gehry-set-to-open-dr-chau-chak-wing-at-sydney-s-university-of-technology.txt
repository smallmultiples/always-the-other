Frank Gehry, the internationally-acclaimed architect, will travel to Sydney to open his first Australian design on February 2.Mr Gehry, who was awarded The 1989 Pritzker Prize in recognition of his lifetime of architectural achievement, will preside over the opening of the Dr. Chau Chak Wing Building at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS).  The 85-year-old icon of post-structuralist architecture has once again defied current methods of structural definition in creating the Ultimo landmark.The east-facing facade of undulating bricks sits in contrast to the geometrically challenging glass shards of the west facade.The $150 million building would have been impossible to realise without the creation of unique bricks and support systems. The 320,000 custom-designed bricks used in the creation of the UTS building were manufactured at a brick factory in Bowral, in southern New South Wales. The bricks, designed to create the sweeping curved affect of the facade, proved a nightmare for engineers and bricklayers alike. "A normal bricklayer does 400, 500, 600 bricks a day, but this job here it's 70, 80," bricklayer Gus Galati told the ABC."In the beginning it was embarrassing: I'm a bricklayer, I was only laying 100 bricks, but this is the way the job is." While the Dr Chau Chak Wing is Mr Gehry's first Australian design, his work has been embraced internationally.Some of his designs are recognised as being among the most important works of contemporary architecture in the world.The American magazine Vanity Fair described him as "the most important architect of our age".The instantly recognisable titanium-clad Guggenheim Museum in Spain, the museum MARTa Herford in Germany, the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto and the Cinémathèque Française in Paris all bear the octogenarian's hallmarks of fluid design. The building was named for philanthropist Dr Chau whose son studied architecture at UTS, after he donated $20 million towards the realisation of the $150 million campus extensionDr Chau donated a further $5 million to create an endowment fund for student scholarships. Dr Chau, an Australian property developer living in China, lived in relative anonymity before his donation towards the construction of the business school.A regular political donor, Dr Chau is proud of his access to Australian political leaders of all persuasions and his company's website is littered with photos of his meetings with three past prime ministers.His political connections also extend to China where he has been appointed to the the Guangdong provincial Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).Dr Chau's daughter, Winky Chow, operates one of his Australian investments, the Australian New Express Daily, a Chinese-language newspaper, while Dr Chau is the proprietor of Guangzhou's New Express Daily in China. The public will get their first glimpse inside the building when students return for semester one of the 2015 academic year on February 23.This should coincide with the opening of the Goods Line extension pedestrian and cycle network, which runs from the western exit of Central Station's Devonshire Street tunnel.
