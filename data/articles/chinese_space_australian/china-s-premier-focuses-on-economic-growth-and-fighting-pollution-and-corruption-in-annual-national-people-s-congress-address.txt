The opening day of China's annual session of parliament has heard the government is predicting solid economic growth this year.In what will come as good news for Australian exporters, the Chinese government has announced a target of 7 per cent GDP growth over the next 12 months.In his opening speech to the National People's Congress China's premier Li Keqiang has said over 10 million jobs would be created in urban areas.Australia's largest trading partner posted a 7.4 per cent growth rate for the previous year, the slowest since 1990.Facing massive environmental challenges, Mr Li said energy intensity would be cut by 3.1 per cent to reduce emissions from major polluters.On fighting corruption he said the Communist Party would encourage thrift, oppose extravagance and promote integrity.Around 3,000 delegates have arrived in Beijing for the start of the 10-day summit.China's annual parliamentary session was opened by Mr Li delivering his annual work report, which is equivalent to the US president's state of the union address.The opening of the annual meeting of the largely rubber-stamp National People's Congress comes less than a week after China cut interest rates for the second time in three months, underscoring the growth challenges the country faces this year.Senior leaders are likely to stress the need for more painful reforms if China wants to support the world's second-biggest economy in the longer term. With the ultimate goal of restructuring the economy to boost consumption at the expense of exports and investment, delegates are expected to discuss ways to advance an array of reforms, from freeing up the workforce to liberalising China's nascent financial market.As part of those reforms, Mr Li announced that the government would link up the Shenzhen and Hong Kong stock exchanges on a trial basis.The move follows a similar scheme between the Shanghai and Hong Kong bourses launched in November, which officials trumpeted as opening up China's closeted stock markets to the outside world.Mr Li also told the gathered delegates that China would boost its military spending by 10.1 per cent this year to 886.9 billion yuan ($180.8 billion) as it cranks up its development of high-tech weapons systems.The spending increase, which will outpace China's slowing, single-digit GDP growth, builds on a nearly unbroken two-decade run of annual double-digit rises in the defence budget.Years of robust expenditure have fuelled a military build-up that has rattled nerves around the region, particularly as China has taken an increasingly robust line on its territorial disputes in the East and South China Seas. Countries from India to Vietnam have been working to narrow the military gap with China through weapons purchases and cooperation."We will comprehensively strengthen modern logistics, step up national defence research and development of new- and  high-technology weapons and equipment, and develop defence-related science and technology industries," Mr Li said."Governments at all levels must always take an active interest in and support the strengthening of our national defence and armed forces."Last year, defence spending was budgeted to rise 12.2  per cent to $166 billion, second only to the Pentagon's proposed $682.6 billion base budget for the US military.Mr Li also announced his government would do everything it could to fight pollution and pledged zero tolerance for corruption, two highly sensitive topics that have become lightning rods for public discontent.Mr Li called pollution a "blight on people's quality of life and a trouble that weighs on their hearts".On corruption, the president, Xi Jinping, told the congress the battle would not end."Our tough stance on corruption is here to stay; our tolerance for corruption is zero, and anyone guilty of corruption will be dealt with seriously," he said.Several senior current and former officials have fallen under Mr Xi, including retired domestic security chief Zhou Yongkang, one of China's most powerful politicians of the past decade, who is accused of crimes ranging from accepting bribes to leaking state secrets.ABC/wires
