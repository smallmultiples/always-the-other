The latest cultural offering in Perth is opera — but not as we know it.A new company is hoping its unorthodox approach to performing opera will bring a new audience to the typically highbrow art form.Freeze Frame Opera's mantra is #NoBoringBits and the company's mission is to make opera accessible, affordable and appealing.Harriet O'Shannessy, a criminal lawyer turned opera singer, is the main driving force behind the new company."The whole idea behind Freeze Frame Opera is to spread the love of opera and introduce a new audience to its magic," she said."We are shortening the traditional opera show lengths and putting them in small venues so the audience can experience being right up close to these amazing voices.Mrs O'Shannessy toured the world chasing her love of opera and the stage before moving back to Perth six years ago to have a baby.She performs with the chorus of the West Australian Opera Company and said she has noticed a homogeneity among audience members."When you look out from the stage at His Majesty's Theatre you get a lot of reflection from glasses and there's a lot of grey hair in the audience," she said."We want to keep opera alive into the future and the only way to do that is by bringing in a younger audience."Mrs O'Shannessy said the limited options for opera singers to get stage experience and opportunities in Perth were also behind her decision to create the company."There are a couple of other small companies that have popped up lately but opportunities are pretty few and far between," she said."There's always people wanting to do more and there's some really incredible singers around that are not able to work full time as singers."One of our singers is a full time house painter and amazing tenor."That tenor is Jun Zhang, who has performed with the Chinese National Opera Company, the Australian Opera Studio and now occasionally performs with the West Australian Opera Company. Another cast member, Emma Pearson, is a Perth native who has returned home after an illustrious award-winning career in Germany at the Hessisches Staatstheater in Wiesbaden."I had an advantage because I had a light voice so it's easier to get work straight away but it's harder for most," she said."There's this dilemma with opera, where you need stage experience to be given stage experience."So when Harriet mentioned that she was starting up Freeze Frame I thought it was fantastic and wanted to support her."The company's launch event — Freeze Frame Opera at the Movies — comes with the description 'We are to opera what 20/20 is to cricket'.It is an hour-long mix of operatic hits from popular films."A drag queen called Lady Diamond opens the show, replicating the scene from Priscilla Queen of the Desert, on top of the bus when there's opera music blaring," Mrs O'Shannessy said.The cast of internationally and nationally acclaimed singers also performs music from Pretty Woman, The Shawshank Redemption, Trainspotting and Philadelphia.Seating an audience of 100 people, the venue at PS Art Space in Fremantle is intimate, with people of all ages attending on opening night.Emma Pearson, Emma Pettemerides, Harriet O'Shannessy, Ileana Rinaldi and Jun Zhang make up the cast, joined by pianist Aidan Boase and Simon Morrison-Baldwin as the 7-foot-tall drag queen Lady Diamond.Freeze Frame Opera at the Movies runs until Sunday November 20.
