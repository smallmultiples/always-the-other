Thirty military personnel from Australia, China and the United States have spent a week in the remote Northern Territory bush with little more than a knife and a water bottle.It was part of Exercise Kowari 2015, which aims to promote friendship and cooperation between the three countries. After five days acclimatising to the Top End heat and humidity, ten soldiers from the Australian Army, ten from the Chinese People's Liberation Army, five from the US Army and five US Marines headed to a remote cattle station in the Daly River.They spent a week being trained in bush skills like constructing shelters without rope and starting a fire from scratch.Then for the last five days, the groups were reshuffled, and sent out with only a few select tools.It was struggle street... you can't lose yourself or you lose your mind. You've really got to pull it together and stay positive. They had to hunt their own food, work out how to cook it and build their own shelter.Darwin based Corporal Mark Rudledge from the Australian Army said that was when teamwork was the most important."It was struggle street and you kind of can't lose yourself or you lose your mind," he said."You've really got to pull it together and stay positive."Working with US soldiers and Marines is common for Australian troops, but the Chinese soldiers were different, said Sergeant Emmaly Hall, who is normally based at Puckapunyal, Victoria."They're very similar to us in different ways though, they're very polite, they just don't curse at all," she said.Sgt Hall had to remind her Chinese comrades not to use certain colourful adjectives they learnt from their Australian colleagues. Captain Pan Kong Bin from the People's Liberation Army said he relied on his new friends from the other nations to help him through the tough Territory conditions."I got a lot of help from the Aussie soldiers and all the US soldiers and officers. They're very friendly, they're always willing to cooperate and work together," he said.On Friday the soldiers and Marines were brought back to camp to enjoy a good lunch and a shower to celebrate their achievement.This is the second year Exercise Kowari has been run, but it comes amid growing tensions between the US and China.China has built several artificial islands in the South China Sea - one of the world's busiest sea lanes.Major General Todd McCaffery from the US Army acknowledged the bumps in the relationship between the two most powerful countries in the world, but said exercises like Kowari were helpful."There's political tension but the military-to-military engagement in the region remains important, and I think we're pleased by the continuing engagement," he said.His Chinese colleague, Major General Han Peng People's Liberation Army said the exercise was "very successful".
