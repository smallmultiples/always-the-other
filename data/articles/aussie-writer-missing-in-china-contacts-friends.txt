A missing Australian writer, who was thought to be in the hands of Chinese secret police, has made contact with some of his friends.Yang Hengjun went missing in Guangzhou on Sunday after telling friends he was being followed.It was assumed he was taken by Chinese secret police following articles he wrote on his blog about human rights abuses in the country.Now he has made contact with some of his friends, telling them the reason he has been out of contact is that he has been sick and because of problems with his mobile phone.But one person who spoke to him told the ABC he sounded very strange when he said it. They also said they were still worried about Dr Yang.Another friend speculated this was an excuse being concocted to give him his freedom and also allow China to save face before the visit of Prime Minister Julia Gillard.The Chinese government denies any knowledge of Dr Yang's so-called disappearance.Greens Senator Scott Ludlam says Australia needs to reassess whether it is comfortable having China as a major trading partner."One of our largest and most important trading partners is a communist dictatorship, virtually," he said."There's no effective democracy there and people who [disagree] with the views of the state are dealt with very, very harshly."I think Australia needs to reassess if we're comfortable with that."Federal Labor backbencher Michael Danby has accused China of detaining the Australian writer and says China's actions are unacceptable."He's an Australian citizen. We're getting a bit sick and tired in this country of Australian citizens being arrested by the Chinese state - it's very contemptuous and it's actually provocative," he said.
