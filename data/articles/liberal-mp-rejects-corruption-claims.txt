Queensland federal Liberal MP Michael Johnson says he utterly rejects any allegations of personal fraud and corruption against him, saying they are a product of a "political witch hunt" instigated by some people within the state's Liberal National Party (LNP).But he has stood by his "unorthodox" and "unconventional" actions of accepting donations, on behalf of an association he chairs, for brokering meetings between Chinese and Australian business leaders.Mr Johnson, who is of Chinese descent, has been the Member for the Brisbane seat of Ryan since 2001. The electorate now hangs on a slim margin of 1.2 per cent.For five years he has been chairman of the Australia-China Development Association.Mr Johnson says he accepts donations from business leaders he has introduced and the donations go to the association.But he rejects as a "slur campaign" reports that any funds are going into his personal bank accounts or he is using any of the funds for personal gain, saying the allegations are "preposterous"."I absolutely reject the allegations of personal fraud and corruption," he said."My bank accounts do not benefit from the Australia-China business forum."Mr Johnson says the allegations are being circulated by "prominent Queenslanders" within the LNP who are trying to pressure him to step aside.He has warned those allegedly acting against him that if they destabilise him the Coalition's electoral chances in Queensland will be cruelled and could also derail Tony Abbott's election campaign.Mr Johnson says as far as he is concerned he will be the Ryan candidate at the next election, and there will be no pre-selection as he has been "grandfathered" after the LNP merger."Prominent Queenslanders - members within the LNP ... have a clearer ambition to take my seat off me and this is all about that and one way to damage my integrity as part of this chinese whispering campaign," he said.The China-Australia Development Association has funded several overseas trips for Mr Johnson, which are declared on the pecuniary register.Mr Johnson says while his lobbying methods are unconventional, he makes no apology for promoting Chinese-Australian business ties and says more MPs should follow his lead in their area of interest."I see that as entirely appropriate as Member of Parliament, "he said.Mr Johnson recently resigned as deputy Opposition whip to focus on his re-election campaign, but would not elaborate on earlier comments he made to The Australian newspaper that Opposition Leader Tony Abbott was under pressure to sack him.The association holds a yearly forum at which speakers are invited to attend.Mr Johnson says several members of the former government have spoken at the forum and Deputy Liberal leader Julie Bishop has also been invited.
